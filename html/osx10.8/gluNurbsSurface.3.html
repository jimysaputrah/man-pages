NAME
       gluNurbsSurface - define the shape of a NURBS surface


C SPECIFICATION
       void gluNurbsSurface( GLUnurbs* nurb,
			     GLint sKnotCount,
			     GLfloat* sKnots,
			     GLint tKnotCount,
			     GLfloat* tKnots,
			     GLint sStride,
			     GLint tStride,
			     GLfloat* control,
			     GLint sOrder,
			     GLint tOrder,
			     GLenum type )


PARAMETERS
       nurb	   Specifies	 the	 NURBS	   object     (created	  with
		   gluNewNurbsRenderer).

       sKnotCount  Specifies the number of knots in the  parametric  u	direc-
		   tion.

       sKnots	   Specifies  an array of sKnotCount nondecreasing knot values
		   in the parametric u direction.

       tKnotCount  Specifies the number of knots in the  parametric  v	direc-
		   tion.

       tKnots	   Specifies  an array of tKnotCount nondecreasing knot values
		   in the parametric v direction.

       sStride	   Specifies the  offset  (as  a  number  of  single-precision
		   floating point values) between successive control points in
		   the parametric u direction in control.

       tStride	   Specifies the offset  (in  single-precision	floating-point
		   values) between successive control points in the parametric
		   v direction in control.

       control	   Specifies an array containing control points for the  NURBS
		   surface.   The offsets between successive control points in
		   the parametric u and v directions are given by sStride  and
		   tStride.

       sOrder	   Specifies  the order of the NURBS surface in the parametric
		   u direction. The order is one more than the degree, hence a
		   surface that is cubic in u has a u order of 4.

       tOrder	   Specifies  the order of the NURBS surface in the parametric
		   v direction. The order is one more than the degree, hence a
		   surface that is cubic in v has a v order of 4.

       type	   Specifies type of the surface. type can be any of the valid
		   two-dimensional evaluator types (such  as  GL_MAP2_VERTEX_3
		   or GL_MAP2_COLOR_4).

DESCRIPTION
       Use gluNurbsSurface within a NURBS (Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline) sur-
       face definition to describe the shape of a NURBS  surface  (before  any
       trimming). To mark the beginning of a NURBS surface definition, use the
       gluBeginSurface command.  To mark the end of a  NURBS  surface  defini-
       tion,  use  the	gluEndSurface  command.  Call gluNurbsSurface within a
       NURBS surface definition only.

       Positional, texture, and color coordinates are associated with  a  sur-
       face  by  presenting  each  as  a  separate  gluNurbsSurface  between a
       gluBeginSurface/gluEndSurface  pair.  No  more	than   one   call   to
       gluNurbsSurface	for  each  of color, position, and texture data can be
       made within a single gluBeginSurface/gluEndSurface  pair.  Exactly  one
       call  must  be  made to describe the position of the surface (a type of
       GL_MAP2_VERTEX_3 or GL_MAP2_VERTEX_4).

       A NURBS surface can be trimmed by using the commands gluNurbsCurve  and
       gluPwlCurve between calls to gluBeginTrim and gluEndTrim.

       Note  that  a  gluNurbsSurface with sKnotCount knots in the u direction
       and tKnotCount knots in the v direction with orders sOrder  and	tOrder
       must  have  (sKnotCount	-  sOrder) times (tKnotCount - tOrder) control
       points.

EXAMPLE
       The following commands render a textured NURBS  surface	with  normals;
       the texture coordinates and normals are also NURBS surfaces:

       gluBeginSurface(nobj);
	  gluNurbsSurface(nobj, ..., GL_MAP2_TEXTURE_COORD_2);
	  gluNurbsSurface(nobj, ..., GL_MAP2_NORMAL);
	  gluNurbsSurface(nobj, ..., GL_MAP2_VERTEX_4); gluEndSurface(nobj);
