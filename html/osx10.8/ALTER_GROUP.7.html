ALTER GROUP(7)		PostgreSQL 9.1.4 Documentation		ALTER GROUP(7)



NAME
       ALTER_GROUP - change role name or membership

SYNOPSIS
       ALTER GROUP group_name ADD USER user_name [, ... ]
       ALTER GROUP group_name DROP USER user_name [, ... ]

       ALTER GROUP group_name RENAME TO new_name

DESCRIPTION
       ALTER GROUP changes the attributes of a user group. This is an obsolete
       command, though still accepted for backwards compatibility, because
       groups (and users too) have been superseded by the more general concept
       of roles.

       The first two variants add users to a group or remove them from a
       group. (Any role can play the part of either a "user" or a "group" for
       this purpose.) These variants are effectively equivalent to granting or
       revoking membership in the role named as the "group"; so the preferred
       way to do this is to use GRANT(7) or REVOKE(7).

       The third variant changes the name of the group. This is exactly
       equivalent to renaming the role with ALTER ROLE (ALTER_ROLE(7)).

PARAMETERS
       group_name
	   The name of the group (role) to modify.

       user_name
	   Users (roles) that are to be added to or removed from the group.
	   The users must already exist; ALTER GROUP does not create or drop
	   users.

       new_name
	   The new name of the group.

EXAMPLES
       Add users to a group:

	   ALTER GROUP staff ADD USER karl, john;

       Remove a user from a group:

	   ALTER GROUP workers DROP USER beth;

COMPATIBILITY
       There is no ALTER GROUP statement in the SQL standard.

       GRANT(7), REVOKE(7), ALTER ROLE (ALTER_ROLE(7))
