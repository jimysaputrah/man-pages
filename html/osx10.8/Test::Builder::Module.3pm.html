NAME
       Test::Builder::Module - Base class for test modules

SYNOPSIS
	 # Emulates Test::Simple
	 package Your::Module;

	 my $CLASS = __PACKAGE__;

	 use base 'Test::Builder::Module';
	 @EXPORT = qw(ok);

	 sub ok ($;$) {
	     my $tb = $CLASS->builder;
	     return $tb->ok(@_);
	 }

	 1;

DESCRIPTION
       This is a superclass for Test::Builder-based modules.  It provides a
       handful of common functionality and a method of getting at the
       underlying Test::Builder object.

   Importing
       Test::Builder::Module is a subclass of Exporter which means your module
       is also a subclass of Exporter.	@EXPORT, @EXPORT_OK, etc...  all act
       normally.

       A few methods are provided to do the "use Your::Module tests =" 23>
       part for you.

       import

       Test::Builder::Module provides an import() method which acts in the
       same basic way as Test::More's, setting the plan and controling
       exporting of functions and variables.  This allows your module to set
       the plan independent of Test::More.

       All arguments passed to import() are passed onto
       "Your::Module->builder->plan()" with the exception of "import
       ="[qw(things to import)]>.

	   use Your::Module import => [qw(this that)], tests => 23;

       says to import the functions this() and that() as well as set the plan
       to be 23 tests.

       import() also sets the exported_to() attribute of your builder to be
       the caller of the import() function.

       Additional behaviors can be added to your import() method by overriding
       import_extra().

       import_extra

	   Your::Module->import_extra(\@import_args);

       import_extra() is called by import().  It provides an opportunity for
       you to add behaviors to your module based on its import list.

       Any extra arguments which shouldn't be passed on to plan() should be
       stripped off by this method.

       See Test::More for an example of its use.

       NOTE This mechanism is VERY ALPHA AND LIKELY TO CHANGE as it feels like
       a bit of an ugly hack in its current form.

   Builder
       Test::Builder::Module provides some methods of getting at the
       underlying Test::Builder object.

       builder

	 my $builder = Your::Class->builder;

       This method returns the Test::Builder object associated with
       Your::Class.  It is not a constructor so you can call it as often as
       you like.

       This is the preferred way to get the Test::Builder object.  You should
       not get it via "Test::Builder->new" as was previously recommended.

       The object returned by builder() may change at runtime so you should
       call builder() inside each function rather than store it in a global.

	 sub ok {
	     my $builder = Your::Class->builder;

	     return $builder->ok(@_);
	 }
