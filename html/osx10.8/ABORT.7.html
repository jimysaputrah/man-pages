ABORT(7)		PostgreSQL 9.1.4 Documentation		      ABORT(7)



NAME
       ABORT - abort the current transaction

SYNOPSIS
       ABORT [ WORK | TRANSACTION ]

DESCRIPTION
       ABORT rolls back the current transaction and causes all the updates
       made by the transaction to be discarded. This command is identical in
       behavior to the standard SQL command ROLLBACK(7), and is present only
       for historical reasons.

PARAMETERS
       WORK, TRANSACTION
	   Optional key words. They have no effect.

NOTES
       Use COMMIT(7) to successfully terminate a transaction.

       Issuing ABORT when not inside a transaction does no harm, but it will
       provoke a warning message.

EXAMPLES
       To abort all changes:

	   ABORT;

COMPATIBILITY
       This command is a PostgreSQL extension present for historical reasons.
       ROLLBACK is the equivalent standard SQL command.

SEE ALSO
       BEGIN(7), COMMIT(7), ROLLBACK(7)
