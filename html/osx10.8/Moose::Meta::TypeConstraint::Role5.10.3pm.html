NAME
       Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint::Role - Role/TypeConstraint parallel
       hierarchy

DESCRIPTION
       This class represents type constraints for a role.

INHERITANCE
       "Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint::Role" is a subclass of
       Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint.

METHODS
       Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint::Role->new(%options)
	   This creates a new role type constraint based on the given
	   %options.

	   It takes the same options as its parent, with two exceptions.
	   First, it requires an additional option, "role", which is name of
	   the constraint's role.  Second, it automatically sets the parent to
	   the "Object" type.

	   The constructor also overrides the hand optimized type constraint
	   with one it creates internally.

       $constraint->role
	   Returns the role name associated with the constraint.

       $constraint->parents
	   Returns all the type's parent types, corresponding to the roles
	   that its role does.

       $constraint->is_subtype_of($type_name_or_object)
	   If the given type is also a role type, then this checks that the
	   type's role does the other type's role.

	   Otherwise it falls back to the implementation in
	   Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint.

       $constraint->create_child_type(%options)
	   This returns a new Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint object with the type
	   as its parent.

	   Note that it does not return a "Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint::Role"
	   object!

       See "BUGS" in Moose for details on reporting bugs.
