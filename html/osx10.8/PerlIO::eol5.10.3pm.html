NAME
       PerlIO::eol - PerlIO layer for normalizing line endings

VERSION
       This document describes version 0.14 of PerlIO::eol, released December
       18, 2006.

SYNOPSIS
	   binmode STDIN, ":raw:eol(LF)";
	   binmode STDOUT, ":raw:eol(CRLF)";
	   open FH, "+<:raw:eol(LF-Native)", "file";

	   binmode STDOUT, ":raw:eol(CRLF?)"; # warns on mixed newlines
	   binmode STDOUT, ":raw:eol(CRLF!)"; # dies on mixed newlines

	   use PerlIO::eol qw( eol_is_mixed );
	   my $pos = eol_is_mixed( "mixed\nstring\r" );

DESCRIPTION
       This layer normalizes any of "CR", "LF", "CRLF" and "Native" into the
       designated line ending.	It works for both input and output handles.

       If you specify two different line endings joined by a "-", it will use
       the first one for reading and the second one for writing.  For example,
       the "LF-CRLF" encoding means that all input should be normalized to
       "LF", and all output should be normalized to "CRLF".

       By default, data with mixed newlines are normalized silently.  Append a
       "!"  to the line ending will raise a fatal exception when mixed
       newlines are spotted.  Append a "?" will raise a warning instead.

       It is advised to pop any potential ":crlf" or encoding layers before
       this layer; this is usually done using a ":raw" prefix.

       This module also optionally exports a "eol_is_mixed" function; it takes
       a string and returns the position of the first inconsistent line ending
       found in that string, or 0 if the line endings are consistent.

       The "CR", "LF", "CRLF" and "NATIVE" constants are also exported at
       request.
