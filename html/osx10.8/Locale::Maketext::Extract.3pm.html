NAME
       Locale::Maketext::Extract - Extract translatable strings from source

SYNOPSIS
	   my $Ext = Locale::Maketext::Extract-&gtnew;
	   $Ext-&gtread_po('messages.po');
	   $Ext-&gtextract_file($_) for &lt*.pl&gt;

	   # Set $entries_are_in_gettext_format if the .pl files above use
	   # loc('%1') instead of loc('[_1]')
	   $Ext-&gtcompile($entries_are_in_gettext_format);

	   $Ext-&gtwrite_po('messages.po');

	   -----------------------------------

	   ### Specifying parser plugins ###

	   my $Ext = Locale::Maketext::Extract-&gtnew(

	       # Specify which parser plugins to use
	       plugins =&gt {

		   # Use Perl parser, process files with extension .pl .pm .cgi
		   perl =&gt [],

		   # Use YAML parser, process all files
		   yaml =&gt ['*'],

		   # Use TT2 parser, process files with extension .tt2 .tt .html
		   # or which match the regex
		   tt2	=&gt [
		       'tt2',
		       'tt',
		       'html',
		       qr/\.tt2?\./
		   ],

		   # Use My::Module as a parser for all files
		   'My::Module' =&gt ['*'],

	       },

	       # Warn if a parser can't process a file or problems loading a plugin
	       warnings =&gt 1,

	       # List processed files
	       verbose =&gt 1,

	   );

DESCRIPTION
       This module can extract translatable strings from files, and write them
       back to PO files.  It can also parse existing PO files and merge their
       contents with newly extracted strings.

       A command-line utility, xgettext.pl, is installed with this module as
       well.

       The format parsers are loaded as plugins, so it is possible to define
       your own parsers.

       Following formats of input files are supported:

       Perl source files  (plugin: perl)
	   Valid localization function names are: "translate", "maketext",
	   "gettext", "loc", "x", "_" and "__".

	   For a slightly more accurate, but much slower Perl parser, you can
	   use the PPI plugin. This does not have a short name (like "perl"),
	   but must be specified in full.

       HTML::Mason (Mason 1) and Mason (Mason 2) (plugin: mason)
	   HTML::Mason (aka Mason 1)
	    Strings inside &lt&|/l&gt...&lt/&&gt and &lt&|/loc&gt...&lt/&&gt are extracted.

	   Mason (aka Mason 2) Strings inside &lt% $.floc { %&gt...&lt/%&gt or &lt% $.fl
	   { %&gt...&lt/%&gt or &lt% $self-&gtfloc { %&gt...&lt/%&gt or &lt% $self-&gtfl {
	   %&gt...&lt/%&gt are extracted.

       Template Toolkit (plugin: tt2)
	   Valid forms are:

	     [% | l(arg1,argn) %]string[% END %]
	     [% 'string' | l(arg1,argn) %]
	     [% l('string',arg1,argn) %]

	     FILTER and | are interchangeable
	     l and loc are interchangeable
	     args are optional

       Text::Template (plugin: text)
	   Sentences between "STARTxxx" and "ENDxxx" are extracted
	   individually.

       YAML (plugin: yaml)
	   Valid forms are _"string" or _'string', eg:

	       title: _"My title"
	       desc:  _'My "quoted" string'

	   Quotes do not have to be escaped, so you could also do:

	       desc:  _"My "quoted" string"

       HTML::FormFu (plugin: formfu)
	   HTML::FormFu uses a config-file to generate forms, with built in
	   support for localizing errors, labels etc.

	   We extract the text after "_loc: ":
	       content_loc: this is the string
	       message_loc: ['Max string length: [_1]', 10]

       Generic Template (plugin: generic)
	   Strings inside {{...}} are extracted.

METHODS
   Constructor
	   new()

	   new(
	       plugins	 =&gt {...},
	       warnings  =&gt 1 | 0,
	       verbose	 =&gt 0 | 1 | 2 | 3,
	   )

       See "Plugins", "Warnings" and "Verbose" for details

   Plugins
	   $ext-&gtplugins({...});

       Locale::Maketext::Extract uses plugins (see below for the list) to
       parse different formats.

       Each plugin can also specify which file types it can parse.

	   # use only the YAML plugin
	   # only parse files with the default extension list defined in the plugin
	   # ie .yaml .yml .conf

	   $ext-&gtplugins({
	       yaml =&gt [],
	   })


	   # use only the Perl plugin
	   # parse all file types

	   $ext-&gtplugins({
	       perl =&gt '*'
	   })

	   $ext-&gtplugins({
	       tt2  =&gt [
		   'tt',	      # matches base filename against /\.tt$/
		   qr/\.tt2?\./,      # matches base filename against regex
		   \&my_filter,       # codref called
	       ]
	   })

	   sub my_filter {
	       my ($base_filename,$path_to_file) = @_;

	       return 1 | 0;
	   }

	   # Specify your own parser
	   # only parse files with the default extension list defined in the plugin

	   $ext-&gtplugins({
	       'My::Extract::Parser'  =&gt []
	   })

       By default, if no plugins are specified, then it uses all of the
       builtin plugins, and overrides the file types specified in each plugin
	- instead, each plugin is tried for every file.

       Available plugins

       "perl"	 : Locale::Maketext::Extract::Plugin::Perl
	   For a slightly more accurate but much slower Perl parser, you can
	   use the PPI plugin. This does not have a short name, but must be
	   specified in full, ie: Locale::Maketext::Extract::Plugin::PPI

       "tt2"	 : Locale::Maketext::Extract::Plugin::TT2
       "yaml"	 : Locale::Maketext::Extract::Plugin::YAML
       "formfu"  : Locale::Maketext::Extract::Plugin::FormFu
       "mason"	 : Locale::Maketext::Extract::Plugin::Mason
       "text"	 : Locale::Maketext::Extract::Plugin::TextTemplate
       "generic" : Locale::Maketext::Extract::Plugin::Generic

       Also, see Locale::Maketext::Extract::Plugin::Base for details of how to
       write your own plugin.

   Warnings
       Because the YAML and TT2 plugins use proper parsers, rather than just
       regexes, if a source file is not valid and it is unable to parse the
       file, then the parser will throw an error and abort parsing.

       The next enabled plugin will be tried.

       By default, you will not see these errors.  If you would like to see
       them, then enable warnings via new(). All parse errors will be printed
       to STDERR.

       Also, if developing your own plugin, turn on warnings to see any errors
       that result from loading your plugin.

   Verbose
       If you would like to see which files have been processed, which plugins
       were used, and which strings were extracted, then enable "verbose". If
       no acceptable plugin was found, or no strings were extracted, then the
       file is not listed:

	     $ext = Locale::Extract-&gtnew( verbose =&gt 1 | 2 | 3);

	  OR
	     xgettext.pl ... -v 	  # files reported
	     xgettext.pl ... -v -v	  # files and plugins reported
	     xgettext.pl ... -v -v -v	  # files, plugins and strings reported

   Accessors
	   header, set_header
	   lexicon, set_lexicon, msgstr, set_msgstr
	   entries, set_entries, entry, add_entry, del_entry
	   compiled_entries, set_compiled_entries, compiled_entry,
	   add_compiled_entry, del_compiled_entry
	   clear

   PO File manipulation
       method read_po ($file)

       method write_po ($file, $add_format_marker?)

   Extraction
	   extract
	   extract_file

   Compilation
       compile($entries_are_in_gettext_style?)

       Merges the "entries" into "compiled_entries".

       If $entries_are_in_gettext_style is true, the previously extracted
       entries are assumed to be in the Gettext style (e.g. %1).

       Otherwise they are assumed to be in Maketext style (e.g. "[_1]") and
       are converted into Gettext style before merging into
       "compiled_entries".

       The "entries" are not cleared after each compilation; use
       "-"set_entries()&gt to clear them if you need to extract from sources
       with varying styles.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
       Thanks to Jesse Vincent for contributing to an early version of this
       module.

       Also to Alain Barbet, who effectively re-wrote the source parser with a
       flex-like algorithm.
