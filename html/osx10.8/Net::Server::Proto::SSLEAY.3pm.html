NAME
       Net::Server::Proto::SSLEAY - Custom Net::Server SSL protocol handler
       based on Net::SSLeay directly.

SYNOPSIS
       See Net::Server::Proto.

DESCRIPTION
       This module is relatively new and has only served a couple of months in
       production environments.  If anybody has any successes or ideas for
       improvment under SSLEAY, please email <paul@seamons.com>.

       Protocol module for Net::Server.  This module implements a secure
       socket layer over tcp (also known as SSL).  See Net::Server::Proto.

PARAMETERS
       Currently there is support for the following:

       "SSL_cert_file"
	   Full path to the certificate file to be used for this server.
	   Should be in PEM format.

       "SSL_key_file"
	   Full path to the key file to be used for this server.  Should be in
	   PEM format.

       "SSL_max_getline_length"
	   Used during getline to only read until this many bytes are found.
	   Default is undef which means unlimited.

       "SSL_error_callback"
	   Should be a code ref that will be called whenever error conditions
	   are encountered.  It passes a source message and an arrayref of the
	   errors.

       I'll add support for more as patches come in.

METHODS
       This module implements most of the common file handle operations.
       There are some additions though:

       "read_until"
	   Takes bytes and match qr.  If bytes is defined - it will read until
	   that many bytes are found.  If match qr is defined, it will read
	   until the buffer matches that qr.  If both are undefined, it will
	   read until there is nothing left to read.

BUGS
       There are probably many.

LICENCE
       Distributed under the same terms as Net::Server

THANKS
       Thanks to Bilbo at
       http://devpit.org/wiki/OpenSSL_with_nonblocking_sockets_%28in_Perl%29
       for documenting a more reliable way of accepting and reading SSL
       connections.
