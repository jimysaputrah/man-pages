NAME
     ioupsd -- daemon to track UPS state

DESCRIPTION
     ioupsd monitors UPS's.  PowerManagement's configd plugin automatically
     launches ioupsd whenever a UPS is connected to the system. Most HID-com-
     pliant USB UPS's are supported at a basic level by OS X; further support
     must be provided by manufacturers.  If a UPS is unsupported, OS X will
     not automatically launch ioupsd.

LOCATION
     /usr/libexec/ioupsd
