GLDRAWBUFFER(3G)		  OpenGL 3.3		      GLDRAWBUFFER(3G)



NAME
       glDrawBuffer - specify which color buffers are to be drawn into

C SPECIFICATION
       void glDrawBuffer(GLenum mode);

PARAMETERS
       mode
	   Specifies up to four color buffers to be drawn into. Symbolic
	   constants GL_NONE, GL_FRONT_LEFT, GL_FRONT_RIGHT, GL_BACK_LEFT,
	   GL_BACK_RIGHT, GL_FRONT, GL_BACK, GL_LEFT, GL_RIGHT, and
	   GL_FRONT_AND_BACK are accepted. The initial value is GL_FRONT for
	   single-buffered contexts, and GL_BACK for double-buffered contexts.

DESCRIPTION
       When colors are written to the frame buffer, they are written into the
       color buffers specified by glDrawBuffer. The specifications are as
       follows:

       GL_NONE
	   No color buffers are written.

       GL_FRONT_LEFT
	   Only the front left color buffer is written.

       GL_FRONT_RIGHT
	   Only the front right color buffer is written.

       GL_BACK_LEFT
	   Only the back left color buffer is written.

       GL_BACK_RIGHT
	   Only the back right color buffer is written.

       GL_FRONT
	   Only the front left and front right color buffers are written. If
	   there is no front right color buffer, only the front left color
	   buffer is written.

       GL_BACK
	   Only the back left and back right color buffers are written. If
	   there is no back right color buffer, only the back left color
	   buffer is written.

       GL_LEFT
	   Only the front left and back left color buffers are written. If
	   there is no back left color buffer, only the front left color
	   buffer is written.

       GL_RIGHT
	   Only the front right and back right color buffers are written. If
	   there is no back right color buffer, only the front right color
	   buffer is written.

       GL_FRONT_AND_BACK
	   All the front and back color buffers (front left, front right, back
	   left, back right) are written. If there are no back color buffers,
	   only the front left and front right color buffers are written. If
	   there are no right color buffers, only the front left and back left
	   color buffers are written. If there are no right or back color
	   buffers, only the front left color buffer is written.

       If more than one color buffer is selected for drawing, then blending or
       logical operations are computed and applied independently for each
       color buffer and can produce different results in each buffer.

       Monoscopic contexts include only left buffers, and stereoscopic
       contexts include both left and right buffers. Likewise, single-buffered
       contexts include only front buffers, and double-buffered contexts
       include both front and back buffers. The context is selected at GL
       initialization.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if mode is not an accepted value.


       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if none of the buffers indicated by
       mode exists.

ASSOCIATED GETS
       glGet() with argument GL_DRAW_BUFFER
