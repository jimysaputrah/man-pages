Scope::Guard(3)       User Contributed Perl Documentation      Scope::Guard(3)



NAME
       Scope::Guard - lexically-scoped resource management

SYNOPSIS
	   my $guard = guard { ... };

	     # or

	   my $guard = scope_guard \&handler;

	     # or

	   my $guard = Scope::Guard->new(sub { ... });

	   $guard->dismiss(); # disable the handler

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides a convenient way to perform cleanup or other forms
       of resource management at the end of a scope. It is particularly useful
       when dealing with exceptions: the "Scope::Guard" constructor takes a
       reference to a subroutine that is guaranteed to be called even if the
       thread of execution is aborted prematurely. This effectively allows
       lexically-scoped "promises" to be made that are automatically honoured
       by perl's garbage collector.

       For more information, see: <http://www.drdobbs.com/cpp/184403758>

METHODS
   new
	   my $guard = Scope::Guard->new(sub { ... });

	     # or

	   my $guard = Scope::Guard->new(\&handler);

       The "new" method creates a new "Scope::Guard" object which calls the
       supplied handler when its "DESTROY" method is called, typically at the
       end of the scope.

   dismiss
	   $guard->dismiss();

	     # or

	   $guard->dismiss(1);

       "dismiss" detaches the handler from the "Scope::Guard" object. This
       revokes the "promise" to call the handler when the object is destroyed.

       The handler can be re-enabled by calling:

	   $guard->dismiss(0);

EXPORTS
   guard
       "guard" takes a block and returns a new "Scope::Guard" object. It can
       be used as a shorthand for:

	   Scope::Guard->new(...)

       e.g.

	   my $guard = guard { ... };

       Note: calling "guard" anonymously, i.e. in void context, will raise an
       exception.  This is because anonymous guards are destroyed immediately
       (rather than at the end of the scope), which is unlikely to be the
       desired behaviour.

   scope_guard
       "scope_guard" is the same as "guard", but it takes a code ref rather
       than a block.  e.g.

	   my $guard = scope_guard \&handler;

       or:

	   my $guard = scope_guard sub { ... };

       or:

	   my $guard = scope_guard $handler;

       As with "guard", calling "scope_guard" in void context will raise an
       exception.
