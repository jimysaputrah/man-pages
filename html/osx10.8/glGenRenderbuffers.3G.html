NAME
       glGenRenderbuffers - generate renderbuffer object names

C SPECIFICATION
       void glGenRenderbuffers(GLsizei n, GLuint *renderbuffers);

PARAMETERS
       n
	   Specifies the number of renderbuffer object names to generate.

       renderbuffers
	   Specifies an array in which the generated renderbuffer object names
	   are stored.

DESCRIPTION
       glGenRenderbuffers returns n renderbuffer object names in
       renderbuffers. There is no guarantee that the names form a contiguous
       set of integers; however, it is guaranteed that none of the returned
       names was in use immediately before the call to glGenRenderbuffers.

       Renderbuffer object names returned by a call to glGenRenderbuffers are
       not returned by subsequent calls, unless they are first deleted with
       glDeleteRenderbuffers().

       The names returned in renderbuffers are marked as used, for the
       purposes of glGenRenderbuffers only, but they acquire state and type
       only when they are first bound.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if n is negative.
