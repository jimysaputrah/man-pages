	       Str255	 post_app_name;
	       Str255	 MIME_type;
	       Str255	 entry_name;

   Functions
       ICStart
       ICStart CREATOR
	   Call this at application initialisation. Set creator to your
	   application creator to allow for future expansion of the IC system
	   (Default is MacPerl's creator). Returns a connection to the IC
	   system.

       ICStop INST
	   It is illegal to call this routine inside a ICBegin/End pair.  Call
	   this at application termination, after which INST is no longer
	   valid connection to IC.

       ICGeneralFindConfigFile INST, SEARCH_PREFS, CAN_CREATE, @FOLDERS
       ICGeneralFindConfigFile INST, SEARCH_PREFS, CAN_CREATE
       ICGeneralFindConfigFile INST
	   Mac OS only.

	   It is illegal to call this routine inside a ICBegin/End pair.  Call
	   to configure this connection to IC.	This routine acts as a more
	   general replacement for ICFindConfigFile and ICFindUserConfigFile.
	   Set search_prefs to 1 (default) if you want it to search the
	   preferences folder.	Set can_create to 1 if you want it to be able
	   to create a new config.  Set count as the number of valid elements
	   in folders.	Set folders to a pointer to the folders to search.
	   Setting count to 0 and folders to nil is OK.  Searches the
	   specified folders and then optionally the Preferences folder in a
	   unspecified manner.

       ICChooseConfig INST
	   Mac OS only.

	   Requires IC 1.2.  It is illegal to call this routine inside a
	   ICBegin/End pair.  Requests the user to choose a configuration,
	   typically using some sort of modal dialog. If the user cancels the
	   dialog the configuration state will be unaffected.

       ICChooseNewConfig INST
	   Mac OS only.

	   Requires IC 1.2.  It is illegal to call this routine inside a
	   ICBegin/End pair.  Requests the user to choose a new configuration,
	   typically using some sort of modal dialog. If the user cancels the
	   dialog the configuration state will be unaffected.

       ICGetConfigName INST, LONGNAME
       ICGetConfigName INST
	   Requires IC 1.2.  You must specify a configuration before calling
	   this routine.  Returns a string that describes the current
	   configuration at a user level. Set longname to 1 if you want a long
	   name, up to 255 characters, or 0 (default) if you want a short
	   name, typically about 32 characters.  The returned string is for
	   user display only. If you rely on the exact format of it, you will
	   conflict with any future IC implementation that doesn't use
	   explicit preference files.

       ICGetConfigReference INST
	   Mac OS only.

	   Requires IC 1.2.  You must specify a configuration before calling
	   this routine.  Returns a self-contained reference to the instance's
	   current configuration.

       ICSetConfigReference INST, REF, FLAGS
       ICSetConfigReference INST, REF
	   Mac OS only.

	   Requires IC 1.2.  It is illegal to call this routine inside a
	   ICBegin/End pair.  Reconfigures the instance using a configuration
	   reference that was got using ICGetConfigReference reference. Set
	   the icNoUserInteraction_bit in flags if you require that this
	   routine not present a modal dialog. Other flag bits are reserved
	   and should be set to zero.

       ICGetSeed INST
	   You do not have to specify a configuration before calling this
	   routine.  You do not have to be inside an ICBegin/End pair to call
	   this routine.  Returns the current seed for the IC prefs database.
	   This seed changes each time a non-volatile preference is changed.
	   You can poll this to determine if any cached preferences change.

       ICGetComponentInstance INST
	   Mac OS only.

	   Requires IC 1.2.  You do not have to specify a configuration before
	   calling this routine.  You do not have to be inside an ICBegin/End
	   pair to call this routine.  Returns the connection to the IC
	   component.

       ICBegin INST, PERM
	   You must specify a configuration before calling this routine. It is
	   illegal to call this routine inside a ICBegin/End pair. Starting
	   reading or writing multiple preferences. A call to this must be
	   balanced by a call to ICEnd. Do not call WaitNextEvent between
	   these calls. The perm specifies whether you intend to read or
	   read/write. Only one writer is allowed per instance. Note that this
	   may open resource files that are not closed until you call ICEnd.

       ICGetPref INST, KEY
	   You must specify a configuration before calling this routine.  If
	   you are getting or setting multiple preferences, you should place
	   these calls within an ICBegin/ICEnd pair.  If you call this routine
	   outside of such a pair, it implicitly calls ICBegin(inst,
	   icReadOnlyPerm).  Reads the preference specified by key from the IC
	   database to the buffer pointed to by buf and size.  key must not be
	   the empty string.  If called in a scalar context, return the
	   preference. If called in a list context, additionally returns the
	   attributes.	Returns icPrefNotFound if there is no preference for
	   the key.

       ICSetPref INST, KEY, VALUE =item ICSetPref INST, KEY, VALUE, ATTR
	   You must specify a configuration before calling this routine.  If
	   you are getting or setting multiple preferences, you should place
	   these calls within an ICBegin/ICEnd pair.  If you call this routine
	   outside of such a pair, it implicitly calls ICBegin(inst,
	   icReadWritePerm).  Sets the preference specified by KEY from the IC
	   database to the VALUE. If attr is ICattr_no_change (the default)
	   then the preference attributes are not set. Otherwise the
	   preference attributes are set to attr.  Returns icPermErr if the
	   previous ICBegin was passed icReadOnlyPerm.	Returns icPermErr if
	   current attr is locked, new attr is locked.

       ICCountPref INST
	   You must specify a configuration before calling this routine.  You
	   must be inside an ICBegin/End pair to call this routine.  Counts
	   the total number of preferences.

       ICGetIndPref   INST, N
	   You must specify a configuration before calling this routine.  You
	   must be inside an ICBegin/End pair to call this routine.  Returns
	   the key of the Nth preference.  n must be positive.	Returns
	   icPrefNotFoundErr if n is greater than the total number of
	   preferences.

       ICDeletePref INST, KEY
	   You must specify a configuration before calling this routine.  You
	   must be inside an ICBegin/End pair to call this routine.  Deletes
	   the preference specified by KEY.  KEY must not be the empty string.
	   Returns icPrefNotFound if the preference specified by key is not
	   present.

       ICEnd INST
	   You must specify a configuration before calling this routine.  You
	   must be inside an ICBegin/End pair to call this routine.
	   Terminates a preference session, as started by ICBegin.  You must
	   have called ICBegin before calling this routine.

       ICEditPreferences   INST, KEY
	   Requires IC 1.1.  You must specify a configuration before calling
	   this routine.  You do not have to be inside an ICBegin/End pair to
	   call this routine.  Instructs IC to display the user interface
	   associated with editing preferences and focusing on the preference
	   specified by key.  If key is the empty string then no preference
	   should be focused upon.  You must have specified a configuration
	   before calling this routine.  You do not need to call ICBegin
	   before calling this routine.  In the current implementation this
	   launches the IC application (or brings it to the front) and
	   displays the window containing the preference specified by key.  It
	   may have a radically different implementation in future IC systems.

       ICParseURL INST, HINT, DATA, START, END
       ICParseURL INST, HINT, DATA
	   Requires IC 1.1.  You must specify a configuration before calling
	   this routine.  You do not have to be inside an ICBegin/End pair to
	   call this routine.  Parses a URL out of the specified text and
	   returns it in a canonical form in a handle.	HINT indicates the
	   default scheme for URLs of the form "name@address".	If HINT is the
	   empty string then URLs of that form are not allowed.  DATA contains
	   the text.  START and END should be passed in as the current
	   selection of the text. This selection is given in the same manner
	   as TextEdit, ie if START == END then there is no selection only an
	   insertion point. Also START X END and 0 X START X length(DATA) and
	   0 X END X length(DATA).  If START and END are omitted, the whole of
	   DATA is assumed.  In a scalar context, returns URL. In an array
	   context, returns URL, START, END.

       ICLaunchURL INST, HINT, DATA, START, END
       ICLaunchURL INST, HINT, DATA
	   Requires IC 1.1.  You must specify a configuration before calling
	   this routine.  You do not have to be inside an ICBegin/End pair to
	   call this routine.  Parses a URL out of the specified text and
	   feeds it off to the appropriate helper.  HINT indicates the default
	   scheme for URLs of the form "name@address".	If HINT is the empty
	   string then URLs of that form are not allowed.  DATA contains the
	   text.  START and END should be passed in as the current selection
	   of the text. This selection is given in the same manner as
	   TextEdit, ie if START == END then there is no selection only an
	   insertion point. Also START X END and 0 X START X length(DATA) and
	   0 X END X length(DATA).  If START and END are omitted, the whole of
	   DATA is assumed.  In a scalar context, returns URL. In an array
	   context, returns URL, START, END.

       ICMapFileName INST, NAME
	   Returns the "ICMapEntry" matching best the given name.

       ICMapTypeCreator INST, TYPE, CREATOR [, NAME]
	   Takes the type and creator (and optionally the name) of an outgoing
	   file and returns the most appropriate "ICMapEntry".

       ICMapEntriesFileName INST, ENTRIES, NAME
	   Returns the "ICMapEntry" matching best the given name.

       ICMapEntriesTypeCreator INST, ENTRIES, TYPE, CREATOR [, NAME]
	   Takes the type and creator (and optionally the name) of an outgoing
	   file and returns the most appropriate "ICMapEntry".

       ICCountMapEntries   INST, ENTRIES
	   Counts the number of entries in the map.

       ICGetIndMapEntry INST, ENTRIES, INDEX
	   Returns the position of a map entry and the entry itself.

	       $map = ICGetIndMapEntry $inst, $entries, 5;
	       ($pos, $map) = ICGetIndMapEntry $inst, $entries, 5;

       ICGetMapEntry INST, ENTRIES, POS
	   Returns the entry located at position pos in the mappings database.

       ICSetMapEntry INST, ENTRIES, POS, ENTRY
	   Replace the entry at position pos

       ICDeleteMapEntry INST, ENTRIES, POS
	   Delete the entry at position pos

       ICAddMapEntry INST, ENTRIES, ENTRY
	   Add an entry to the database.

       GetURL URL
	   Launch helper app with URL.	Returns undef on error.

       GetICHelper PROTOCOL
	   Return list of creator ID and name for helper app assigned to
	   PROTOCOL.  Returns only creator ID in scalar context.  Returns
