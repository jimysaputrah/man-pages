NAME
       HTTP::Cookies::Netscape - access to Netscape cookies files

SYNOPSIS
	use LWP;
	use HTTP::Cookies::Netscape;
	$cookie_jar = HTTP::Cookies::Netscape->new(
	  file => "c:/program files/netscape/users/ZombieCharity/cookies.txt",
	);
	my $browser = LWP::UserAgent->new;
	$browser->cookie_jar( $cookie_jar );

DESCRIPTION
       This is a subclass of "HTTP::Cookies" that reads (and optionally
       writes) Netscape/Mozilla cookie files.

       See the documentation for HTTP::Cookies.

CAVEATS
       Please note that the Netscape/Mozilla cookie file format can't store
       all the information available in the Set-Cookie2 headers, so you will
       probably lose some information if you save in this format.

       At time of writing, this module seems to work fine with Mozilla
       Phoenix/Firebird.
