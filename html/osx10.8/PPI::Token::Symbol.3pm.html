NAME
       PPI::Token::Symbol - A token class for variables and other symbols

INHERITANCE
	 PPI::Token::Symbol
	 isa PPI::Token
	     isa PPI::Element

DESCRIPTION
       The "PPI::Token::Symbol" class is used to cover all tokens that
       represent variables and other things that start with a sigil.

METHODS
       This class has several methods beyond what is provided by its
       PPI::Token and PPI::Element parent classes.

       Most methods are provided to help work out what the object is actually
       pointing at, rather than what it might appear to be pointing at.

   canonical
       The "canonical" method returns a normalized, canonical version of the
       symbol.

       For example, it converts "$ ::foo'bar::baz" to $main::foo::bar::baz.

       This does not fully resolve the symbol, but merely removes syntax
       variations.

   symbol
       The "symbol" method returns the ACTUAL symbol this token refers to.

       A token of $foo might actually be referring to @foo, if it is found in
       the form $foo[1].

       This method attempts to resolve these issues to determine the actual
       symbol.

       Returns the symbol as a string.

   raw_type
       The "raw_type" method returns the apparent type of the symbol in the
       form of its sigil.

       Returns the sigil as a string.

   symbol_type
       The "symbol_type" method returns the actual type of the symbol in the
       form of its sigil.

       Returns the sigil as a string.

SUPPORT
       See the support section in the main module.
