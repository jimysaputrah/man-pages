NAME

SYNOPSIS
       Don't use this module directly.

DESCRIPTION
       This module is used internally as a base class by Time::localtime And
       Time::gmtime functions.	It creates a Time::tm struct object which is
       addressable just like's C's tm structure from time.h; namely with sec,
       min, hour, mday, mon, year, wday, yday, and isdst.

       This class is an internal interface only.
