NAME
       Encode::MIME::Header -- MIME 'B' and 'Q' header encoding

SYNOPSIS
	   use Encode qw/encode decode/;
	   $utf8   = decode('MIME-Header', $header);
	   $header = encode('MIME-Header', $utf8);

ABSTRACT
       This module implements RFC 2047 Mime Header Encoding.  There are 3
       variant encoding names; "MIME-Header", "MIME-B" and "MIME-Q".  The
       difference is described below

		     decode()	       encode()
	 ----------------------------------------------
	 MIME-Header Both B and Q      =?UTF-8?B?....?=
	 MIME-B      B only; Q croaks  =?UTF-8?B?....?=
	 MIME-Q      Q only; B croaks  =?UTF-8?Q?....?=

DESCRIPTION
       When you decode(=?encoding?X?ENCODED WORD?=), ENCODED WORD is extracted
       and decoded for X encoding (B for Base64, Q for Quoted-Printable). Then
       the decoded chunk is fed to decode(encoding).  So long as encoding is
       supported by Encode, any source encoding is fine.

       When you encode, it just encodes UTF-8 string with X encoding then
       quoted with =?UTF-8?X?....?= .  The parts that RFC 2047 forbids to
       encode are left as is and long lines are folded within 76 bytes per
       line.

BUGS
       It would be nice to support encoding to non-UTF8, such as
       =?ISO-2022-JP?  and =?ISO-8859-1?= but that makes the implementation
       too complicated.  These days major mail agents all support =?UTF-8? so
       I think it is just good enough.

       Due to popular demand, 'MIME-Header-ISO_2022_JP' was introduced by
       Makamaka.  Thre are still too many MUAs especially cellular phone
       handsets which does not grok UTF-8.
