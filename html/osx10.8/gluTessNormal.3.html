NAME
       gluTessNormal - specify a normal for a polygon


C SPECIFICATION
       void gluTessNormal( GLUtesselator* tess,
			   GLdouble valueX,
			   GLdouble valueY,
			   GLdouble valueZ )


PARAMETERS
       tess    Specifies the tessellation object (created with gluNewTess).

       valueX  Specifies the first component of the normal.

       valueY  Specifies the second component of the normal.

       valueZ  Specifies the third component of the normal.

DESCRIPTION
       gluTessNormal  describes  a  normal  for  a polygon that the program is
       defining.  All input data will be projected onto a plane  perpendicular
       to  one of the three coordinate axes before tessellation and all output
       triangles will be oriented CCW with respect to the normal (CW  orienta-
       tion can be obtained by reversing the sign of the supplied normal). For
       example, if you know that all polygons  lie  in	the  x-y  plane,  call
       gluTessNormal(tess, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0) before rendering any polygons.

       If the supplied normal is (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) (the initial value), the nor-
       mal is determined as follows. The direction of the normal,  up  to  its
       sign,  is  found  by fitting a plane to the vertices, without regard to
       how the vertices are connected. It is expected that the input data lies
       approximately  in the plane; otherwise, projection perpendicular to one
       of the three coordinate axes may substantially change the geometry. The
       sign of the normal is chosen so that the sum of the signed areas of all
       input contours is nonnegative (where a CCW contour has positive	area).

       The  supplied  normal  persists	until it is changed by another call to
       gluTessNormal.
