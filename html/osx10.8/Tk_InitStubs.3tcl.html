NAME
       Tk_InitStubs - initialize the Tk stubs mechanism

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lttk.h&gt

       const char *
       Tk_InitStubs(interp, version, exact)

ARGUMENTS
       Tcl_Interp *interp (in)		Tcl interpreter handle.

       char *version (in)		A  version string consisting of one or
					more  decimal  numbers	separated   by
					dots.

       int exact (in)			Non-zero  means that only the particu-
					lar Tk version specified by version is
					acceptable.   Zero means that versions
					newer than version are also acceptable
					as  long  as  they have the same major
					version number as version.

INTRODUCTION
       The Tcl stubs mechanism defines a way to dynamically bind extensions to
       a  particular  Tcl  implementation  at  run  time.  the stubs mechanism
       requires no changes to applications incoporating  Tcl/Tk  interpreters.
       Only  developers  creating C-based Tcl/Tk extensions need to take steps
       to use the stubs mechanism with their extensions.   See	the  Tcl_Init-
       Stubs page for more information.

       Enabling  the  stubs mechanism for a Tcl/Tk extension requires the fol-
       lowing steps:

       1)   Call Tcl_InitStubs in the extension before calling any  other  Tcl
	    functions.

       2)   Call  Tk_InitStubs	if  the  extension before calling any other Tk
	    functions.

       2)   Define the USE_TCL_STUBS symbol. Typically, you would include  the
	    -DUSE_TCL_STUBS flag when compiling the extension.

       3)   Link  the extension with the Tcl and Tk stubs libraries instead of
	    the standard Tcl and Tk libraries.	On Unix platforms, the library
	    names  are	libtclstub8.4.a  and  libtkstub8.4.a; on Windows plat-
	    forms,  the  library  names  are  tclstub84.lib  and  tkstub84.lib
	    (adjust names with appropriate version number).

DESCRIPTION
       Tk_InitStubs  attempts  to  initialize  the  Tk stub table pointers and
       ensure that the correct version of Tk is loaded.   In  addition	to  an
       interpreter  handle,  it  accepts  as  arguments a version number and a
       Boolean flag indicating whether the extension requires an exact version
       match  or  not.	 If  exact is 0, then the extension is indicating that
       newer versions of Tk are acceptable as long as they have the same major
       version	number as version; non-zero means that only the specified ver-
       sion is acceptable.  Tcl_InitStubs  returns  a  string  containing  the
       actual  version of Tk satisfying the request, or NULL if the Tk version
       is not acceptable, does not support the stubs mechanism, or  any  other
       error condition occurred.
