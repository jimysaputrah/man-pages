PTHREAD_JOIN(3) 	 BSD Library Functions Manual	       PTHREAD_JOIN(3)

NAME
     pthread_join -- wait for thread termination

SYNOPSIS
     #include &ltpthread.h&gt

     int
     pthread_join(pthread_t thread, void **value_ptr);

DESCRIPTION
     The pthread_join() function suspends execution of the calling thread
     until the target thread terminates, unless the target thread has already
     terminated.

     On return from a successful pthread_join() call with a non-NULL value_ptr
     argument, the value passed to pthread_exit() by the terminating thread is
     stored in the location referenced by value_ptr.  When a pthread_join()
     returns successfully, the target thread has been terminated.  The results
     of multiple simultaneous calls to pthread_join(), specifying the same
     target thread, are undefined.  If the thread calling pthread_join() is
     cancelled, the target thread is not detached.

RETURN VALUES
     If successful,  the pthread_join() function will return zero.  Otherwise,
     an error number will be returned to indicate the error.

ERRORS
     pthread_join() will fail if:

     [EDEADLK]		A deadlock was detected or the value of thread speci-
			fies the calling thread.

     [EINVAL]		The implementation has detected that the value speci-
			fied by thread does not refer to a joinable thread.

     [ESRCH]		No thread could be found corresponding to that speci-
			fied by the given thread ID, thread.

SEE ALSO
     wait(2), pthread_create(3)

STANDARDS
     pthread_join() conforms to ISO/IEC 9945-1:1996 (``POSIX.1'').
