CPANPLUS(3pm)	       Perl Programmers Reference Guide 	 CPANPLUS(3pm)



NAME
       CPANPLUS - API & CLI access to the CPAN mirrors

SYNOPSIS
	   ### standard invocation from the command line
	   $ cpanp
	   $ cpanp -i Some::Module

	   $ perl -MCPANPLUS -eshell
	   $ perl -MCPANPLUS -e'fetch Some::Module'

DESCRIPTION
       The "CPANPLUS" library is an API to the "CPAN" mirrors and a collection
       of interactive shells, commandline programs, etc, that use this API.

GUIDE TO DOCUMENTATION
   GENERAL USAGE
       This is the document you are currently reading. It describes basic
       usage and background information. Its main purpose is to assist the
       user who wants to learn how to invoke CPANPLUS and install modules from
       the commandline and to point you to more indepth reading if required.

   API REFERENCE
       The "CPANPLUS" API is meant to let you programmatically interact with
       the "CPAN" mirrors. The documentation in CPANPLUS::Backend shows you
       how to create an object capable of interacting with those mirrors,
       letting you create & retrieve module objects.  CPANPLUS::Module shows
       you how you can use these module objects to perform actions like
       installing and testing.

       The default shell, documented in CPANPLUS::Shell::Default is also
       scriptable. You can use its API to dispatch calls from your script to
       the CPANPLUS Shell.

COMMANDLINE TOOLS
   STARTING AN INTERACTIVE SHELL
       You can start an interactive shell by running either of the two
       following commands:

	   $ cpanp

	   $ perl -MCPANPLUS -eshell

       All commans available are listed in the interactive shells help menu.
       See "cpanp -h" or CPANPLUS::Shell::Default for instructions on using
       the default shell.

   CHOOSE A SHELL
       By running "cpanp" without arguments, you will start up the shell
       specified in your config, which defaults to CPANPLUS::Shell::Default.
       There are more shells available.  "CPANPLUS" itself ships with an
       emulation shell called CPANPLUS::Shell::Classic that looks and feels
       just like the old "CPAN.pm" shell.

       You can start this shell by typing:

	   $ perl -MCPANPLUS -e'shell Classic'

       Even more shells may be available from "CPAN".

       Note that if you have changed your default shell in your configuration,
       that shell will be used instead. If for some reason there was an error
       with your specified shell, you will be given the default shell.

   BUILDING PACKAGES
       "cpan2dist" is a commandline tool to convert any distribution from
       "CPAN" into a package in the format of your choice, like for example
       ".deb" or "FreeBSD ports".

       See "cpan2dist -h" for details.

FUNCTIONS
       For quick access to common commands, you may use this module,
       "CPANPLUS" rather than the full programmatic API situated in
       "CPANPLUS::Backend". This module offers the following functions:

   $bool = install( Module::Name | /A/AU/AUTHOR/Module-Name-1.tgz )
       This function requires the full name of the module, which is case
       sensitive.  The module name can also be provided as a fully qualified
       file name, beginning with a /, relative to the /authors/id directory on
       a CPAN mirror.

       It will download, extract and install the module.

   $where = fetch( Module::Name | /A/AU/AUTHOR/Module-Name-1.tgz )
       Like install, fetch needs the full name of a module or the fully
       qualified file name, and is case sensitive.

       It will download the specified module to the current directory.

   $where = get( Module::Name | /A/AU/AUTHOR/Module-Name-1.tgz )
       Get is provided as an alias for fetch for compatibility with CPAN.pm.

   shell()
       Shell starts the default CPAN shell.  You can also start the shell by
       using the "cpanp" command, which will be installed in your perl bin.
