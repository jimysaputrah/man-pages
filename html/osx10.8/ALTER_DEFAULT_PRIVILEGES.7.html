ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGESPostgreSQL 9.1.4 DocumentatALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES(7)



NAME
       ALTER_DEFAULT_PRIVILEGES - define default access privileges

SYNOPSIS
       ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES
	   [ FOR { ROLE | USER } target_role [, ...] ]
	   [ IN SCHEMA schema_name [, ...] ]
	   abbreviated_grant_or_revoke

       where abbreviated_grant_or_revoke is one of:

       GRANT { { SELECT | INSERT | UPDATE | DELETE | TRUNCATE | REFERENCES | TRIGGER }
	   [, ...] | ALL [ PRIVILEGES ] }
	   ON TABLES
	   TO { [ GROUP ] role_name | PUBLIC } [, ...] [ WITH GRANT OPTION ]

       GRANT { { USAGE | SELECT | UPDATE }
	   [, ...] | ALL [ PRIVILEGES ] }
	   ON SEQUENCES
	   TO { [ GROUP ] role_name | PUBLIC } [, ...] [ WITH GRANT OPTION ]

       GRANT { EXECUTE | ALL [ PRIVILEGES ] }
	   ON FUNCTIONS
	   TO { [ GROUP ] role_name | PUBLIC } [, ...] [ WITH GRANT OPTION ]

       REVOKE [ GRANT OPTION FOR ]
	   { { SELECT | INSERT | UPDATE | DELETE | TRUNCATE | REFERENCES | TRIGGER }
	   [, ...] | ALL [ PRIVILEGES ] }
	   ON TABLES
	   FROM { [ GROUP ] role_name | PUBLIC } [, ...]
	   [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ]

       REVOKE [ GRANT OPTION FOR ]
	   { { USAGE | SELECT | UPDATE }
	   [, ...] | ALL [ PRIVILEGES ] }
	   ON SEQUENCES
	   FROM { [ GROUP ] role_name | PUBLIC } [, ...]
	   [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ]

       REVOKE [ GRANT OPTION FOR ]
	   { EXECUTE | ALL [ PRIVILEGES ] }
	   ON FUNCTIONS
	   FROM { [ GROUP ] role_name | PUBLIC } [, ...]
	   [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ]

DESCRIPTION
       ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES allows you to set the privileges that will be
       applied to objects created in the future. (It does not affect
       privileges assigned to already-existing objects.) Currently, only the
       privileges for tables (including views and foreign tables), sequences,
       and functions can be altered.

       You can change default privileges only for objects that will be created
       by yourself or by roles that you are a member of. The privileges can be
       set globally (i.e., for all objects created in the current database),
       or just for objects created in specified schemas. Default privileges
       that are specified per-schema are added to whatever the global default
       privileges are for the particular object type.

       As explained under GRANT(7), the default privileges for any object type
       normally grant all grantable permissions to the object owner, and may
       grant some privileges to PUBLIC as well. However, this behavior can be
       changed by altering the global default privileges with ALTER DEFAULT
       PRIVILEGES.

   Parameters
       target_role
	   The name of an existing role of which the current role is a member.
	   If FOR ROLE is omitted, the current role is assumed.

       schema_name
	   The name of an existing schema. Each target_role must have CREATE
	   privileges for each specified schema. If IN SCHEMA is omitted, the
	   global default privileges are altered.

       role_name
	   The name of an existing role to grant or revoke privileges for.
	   This parameter, and all the other parameters in
	   abbreviated_grant_or_revoke, act as described under GRANT(7) or
	   REVOKE(7), except that one is setting permissions for a whole class
	   of objects rather than specific named objects.

NOTES
       Use psql(1)'s \ddp command to obtain information about existing
       assignments of default privileges. The meaning of the privilege values
       is the same as explained for \dp under GRANT(7).

       If you wish to drop a role for which the default privileges have been
       altered, it is necessary to reverse the changes in its default
       privileges or use DROP OWNED BY to get rid of the default privileges
       entry for the role.

EXAMPLES
       Grant SELECT privilege to everyone for all tables (and views) you
       subsequently create in schema myschema, and allow role webuser to
       INSERT into them too:

	   ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA myschema GRANT SELECT ON TABLES TO PUBLIC;
	   ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA myschema GRANT INSERT ON TABLES TO webuser;

       Undo the above, so that subsequently-created tables won't have any more
       permissions than normal:

	   ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA myschema REVOKE SELECT ON TABLES FROM PUBLIC;
	   ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA myschema REVOKE INSERT ON TABLES FROM webuser;

       Remove the public EXECUTE permission that is normally granted on
       functions, for all functions subsequently created by role admin:

	   ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES FOR ROLE admin REVOKE EXECUTE ON FUNCTIONS FROM PUBLIC;

COMPATIBILITY
       There is no ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES statement in the SQL standard.
