NAME
       DROP_USER_MAPPING - remove a user mapping for a foreign server

SYNOPSIS
       DROP USER MAPPING [ IF EXISTS ] FOR { user_name | USER | CURRENT_USER | PUBLIC } SERVER server_name

DESCRIPTION
       DROP USER MAPPING removes an existing user mapping from foreign server.

       The owner of a foreign server can drop user mappings for that server
       for any user. Also, a user can drop a user mapping for his own user
       name if USAGE privilege on the server has been granted to the user.

PARAMETERS
       IF EXISTS
	   Do not throw an error if the user mapping does not exist. A notice
	   is issued in this case.

       user_name
	   User name of the mapping.  CURRENT_USER and USER match the name of
	   the current user.  PUBLIC is used to match all present and future
	   user names in the system.

       server_name
	   Server name of the user mapping.

EXAMPLES
       Drop a user mapping bob, server foo if it exists:

	   DROP USER MAPPING IF EXISTS FOR bob SERVER foo;

COMPATIBILITY
       DROP USER MAPPING conforms to ISO/IEC 9075-9 (SQL/MED). The IF EXISTS
       clause is a PostgreSQL extension.
