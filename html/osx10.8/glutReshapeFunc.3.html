NAME
       glutReshapeFunc - sets the reshape callback for the current window.

SYNTAX
       #include &ltGLUT/glut.h&gt

       void glutReshapeFunc(void (*func)(int width, int height));

ARGUMENTS
       func	 The new reshape callback function.

DESCRIPTION
       glutReshapeFunc	sets  the reshape callback for the current window. The
       reshape callback is triggered when a  window  is  reshaped.  A  reshape
       callback  is also triggered immediately before a window's first display
       callback after a window is created or whenever an overlay for the  win-
       dow  is	established.  The  width and height parameters of the callback
       specify the new window size in pixels. Before the callback, the current
       window is set to the window that has been reshaped.

       If  a reshape callback is not registered for a window or NULL is passed
       to glutReshapeFunc (to deregister a  previously	registered  callback),
       the default reshape callback is used. This default callback will simply
       call glViewport(0,0,width,height) on the normal plane (and on the over-
       lay if one exists).

       If  an overlay is established for the window, a single reshape callback
       is generated. It is the callback's responsibility to  update  both  the
       normal  plane  and overlay for the window (changing the layer in use as
       necessary).

       When a top-level window is reshaped, subwindows are not reshaped. It is
       up  to  the GLUT program to manage the size and positions of subwindows
       within a top-level window. Still, reshape callbacks will  be  triggered
       for subwindows when their size is changed using glutReshapeWindow.
