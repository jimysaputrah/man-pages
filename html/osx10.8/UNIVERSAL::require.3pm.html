NAME
       UNIVERSAL::require - require() modules from a variable

SYNOPSIS
	 # This only needs to be said once in your program.
	 require UNIVERSAL::require;

	 # Same as "require Some::Module"
	 my $module = 'Some::Module';
	 $module->require or die $@;

	 # Same as "use Some::Module"
	 BEGIN { $module->use or die $@ }

DESCRIPTION
       If you've ever had to do this...

	   eval "require $module";

       to get around the bareword caveats on require(), this module is for
       you.  It creates a universal require() class method that will work with
       every Perl module and its secure.  So instead of doing some arcane
       eval() work, you can do this:

	   $module->require;

       It doesn't save you much typing, but it'll make alot more sense to
       someone who's not a ninth level Perl acolyte.

Methods
       require

	 my $return_val = $module->require	     or die $@;
	 my $return_val = $module->require($version) or die $@;

       This works exactly like Perl's require, except without the bareword
       restriction, and it doesn't die.  Since require() is placed in the
       UNIVERSAL namespace, it will work on any module.  You just have to use
       UNIVERSAL::require somewhere in your code.

       Should the module require fail, or not be a high enough $version, it
       will simply return false and not die.  The error will be in $@ as well
       as $UNIVERSAL::require::ERROR.

	   $module->require or die $@;

       use

	   my $require_return = $module->use	       or die $@;
	   my $require_return = $module->use(@imports) or die $@;

       Like "UNIVERSAL::require", this allows you to "use" a $module without
       having to eval to work around the bareword requirement.	It returns the
       same as require.

       Should either the require or the import fail it will return false.  The
       error will be in $@.

       If possible, call this inside a BEGIN block to emulate a normal "use"
       as closely as possible.

	   BEGIN { $module->use }

SECURITY NOTES
       UNIVERSAL::require makes use of "eval STRING".  In previous versions of
       UNIVERSAL::require it was discovered that one could craft a class name
       which would result in code being executed.  This hole has been closed.
       The only variables now exposed to "eval STRING" are the caller's
       package, filename and line which are not tainted.

       UNIVERSAL::require is taint clean.
