NAME
       Tie::Memoize - add data to hash when needed

SYNOPSIS
	 require Tie::Memoize;
	 tie %hash, 'Tie::Memoize',
	     \&fetch,		       # The rest is optional
	     $DATA, \&exists,
	     {%ini_value}, {%ini_existence};

DESCRIPTION
       This package allows a tied hash to autoload its values on the first
       access, and to use the cached value on the following accesses.

       Only read-accesses (via fetching the value or "exists") result in calls
       to the functions; the modify-accesses are performed as on a normal
       hash.

       The required arguments during "tie" are the hash, the package, and the
       reference to the "FETCH"ing function.  The optional arguments are an
       arbitrary scalar $data, the reference to the "EXISTS" function, and
       initial values of the hash and of the existence cache.

       Both the "FETCH"ing function and the "EXISTS" functions have the same
       signature: the arguments are "$key, $data"; $data is the same value as
       given as argument during tie()ing.  Both functions should return an
       empty list if the value does not exist.	If "EXISTS" function is
       different from the "FETCH"ing function, it should return a TRUE value
       on success.  The "FETCH"ing function should return the intended value
       if the key is valid.

Inheriting from Tie::Memoize
       The structure of the tied() data is an array reference with elements

	 0:  cache of known values
	 1:  cache of known existence of keys
	 2:  FETCH  function
	 3:  EXISTS function
	 4:  $data

       The rest is for internal usage of this package.	In particular, if
       TIEHASH is overwritten, it should call SUPER::TIEHASH.

EXAMPLE
	 sub slurp {
	   my ($key, $dir) = shift;
	   open my $h, '&lt', "$dir/$key" or return;
	   local $/; &lt$h&gt		       # slurp it all
	 }
	 sub exists { my ($key, $dir) = shift; return -f "$dir/$key" }

	 tie %hash, 'Tie::Memoize', \&slurp, $directory, \&exists,
	     { fake_file1 =&gt $content1, fake_file2 =&gt $content2 },
	     { pretend_does_not_exists =&gt 0, known_to_exist =&gt 1 };

       This example treats the slightly modified contents of $directory as a
       hash.  The modifications are that the keys fake_file1 and fake_file2
       fetch values $content1 and $content2, and pretend_does_not_exists will
       never be accessed.  Additionally, the existence of known_to_exist is
       never checked (so if it does not exists when its content is needed, the
       user of %hash may be confused).

BUGS
       FIRSTKEY and NEXTKEY methods go through the keys which were already
       read, not all the possible keys of the hash.
