NAME
       iconv_open - allocate descriptor for character set conversion

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lticonv.h&gt

       iconv_t iconv_open (const char* tocode, const char* fromcode);

DESCRIPTION
       The  iconv_open function allocates a conversion descriptor suitable for
       converting byte sequences from character encoding fromcode to character
       encoding tocode.

       The values permitted for fromcode and tocode and the supported combina-
       tions are system dependent. For the  libiconv  library,	the  following
       encodings are supported, in all combinations.

       European languages
	      ASCII,  ISO-8859-{1,2,3,4,5,7,9,10,13,14,15,16}, KOI8-R, KOI8-U,

	      UTF-32, UTF-32BE, UTF-32LE
	      UTF-7
	      C99, JAVA

       Full Unicode, in terms of uint16_t or uint32_t
	      (with machine dependent endianness and alignment)
	      UCS-2-INTERNAL, UCS-4-INTERNAL

       Locale dependent, in terms of char or wchar_t
	      (with  machine  dependent  endianness  and  alignment,  and with
	      semantics depending on the OS and the  current  LC_CTYPE	locale
	      facet)
	      char, wchar_t

       When  configured with the option --enable-extra-encodings, it also pro-
       vides support for a few extra encodings:

       European languages
	      CP{437,737,775,852,853,855,857,858,860,861,863,865,869,1125}

       Semitic languages
	      CP864

       Japanese
	      EUC-JISX0213, Shift_JISX0213, ISO-2022-JP-3

       Chinese
	      BIG5-2003 (experimental)

       Turkmen
	      TDS565

       Platform specifics
	      ATARIST, RISCOS-LATIN1

       The empty encoding name "" is equivalent  to  "char":  it  denotes  the
       locale dependent character encoding.

       When  the string "//TRANSLIT" is appended to tocode, transliteration is
       activated. This means that when a character cannot  be  represented  in
       the target character set, it can be approximated through one or several
       similarly looking characters.

       When the string "//IGNORE" is appended to tocode, characters that  can-
       not  be	represented  in the target character set will be silently dis-
       carded.

       The resulting conversion descriptor can be used with iconv  any	number
       of times. It remains valid until deallocated using iconv_close.

       A  conversion  descriptor  contains  a conversion state. After creation
       using iconv_open, the state is in the initial state. Using iconv  modi-
       fies the descriptor's conversion state. (This implies that a conversion
       descriptor can not be used  in  multiple  threads  simultaneously.)  To
       bring the state back to the initial state, use iconv with NULL as inbuf
       argument.

RETURN VALUE
       The iconv_open function returns a freshly allocated conversion descrip-
       tor. In case of error, it sets errno and returns (iconv_t)(-1).

ERRORS
       The following error can occur, among others:

       EINVAL The  conversion  from fromcode to tocode is not supported by the
	      implementation.
