NAME
       Pod::Perldoc::ToRtf - let Perldoc render Pod as RTF

SYNOPSIS
	 perldoc -o rtf Some::Modulename

DESCRIPTION
       This is a "plug-in" class that allows Perldoc to use Pod::Simple::RTF
       as a formatter class.

       This is actually a Pod::Simple::RTF subclass, and inherits all its
       options.

       You have to have Pod::Simple::RTF installed (from the Pod::Simple
       dist), or this module won't work.

       If Perldoc is running under MSWin and uses this class as a formatter,
       the output will be opened with write.exe or whatever program is
       specified in the environment variable "RTFREADER". For example, to
       specify that RTF files should be opened the same as they are when you
       double-click them, you would do "set RTFREADER=start.exe" in your
       autoexec.bat.

       Handy tip: put "set PERLDOC=-ortf" in your autoexec.bat and that will
       set this class as the default formatter to run when you do "perldoc
       whatever".
