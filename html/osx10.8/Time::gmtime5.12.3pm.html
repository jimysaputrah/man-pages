Time::gmtime(3pm)      Perl Programmers Reference Guide      Time::gmtime(3pm)



NAME
       Time::gmtime - by-name interface to Perl's built-in gmtime() function

SYNOPSIS
	use Time::gmtime;
	$gm = gmtime();
	printf "The day in Greenwich is %s\n",
	   (qw(Sun Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun))[ $gm-&gtwday() ];

	use Time::gmtime qw(:FIELDS);
	gmtime();
	printf "The day in Greenwich is %s\n",
	   (qw(Sun Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun))[ $tm_wday ];

	$now = gmctime();

	use Time::gmtime;
	use File::stat;
	$date_string = gmctime(stat($file)-&gtmtime);

DESCRIPTION
       This module's default exports override the core gmtime() function,
       replacing it with a version that returns "Time::tm" objects.  This
       object has methods that return the similarly named structure field name
       from the C's tm structure from time.h; namely sec, min, hour, mday,
       mon, year, wday, yday, and isdst.

       You may also import all the structure fields directly into your
       namespace as regular variables using the :FIELDS import tag.  (Note
       that this still overrides your core functions.)	Access these fields as
       variables named with a preceding "tm_" in front their method names.
       Thus, "$tm_obj-&gtmday()" corresponds to $tm_mday if you import the
       fields.

       The gmctime() function provides a way of getting at the scalar sense of
       the original CORE::gmtime() function.

       To access this functionality without the core overrides, pass the "use"
       an empty import list, and then access function functions with their
       full qualified names.  On the other hand, the built-ins are still
       available via the "CORE::" pseudo-package.

NOTE
       While this class is currently implemented using the Class::Struct
       module to build a struct-like class, you shouldn't rely upon this.
