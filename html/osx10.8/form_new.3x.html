NAME
       form_new - create and destroy forms

SYNOPSIS
       #include &ltform.h&gt
       FORM *new_form(FIELD **fields);
       int free_form(FORM *form);

DESCRIPTION
       The function new_form creates a new form connected to a specified field
       pointer array (which must be NULL-terminated).

       The function free_form disconnects form from its field array and  frees
       the storage allocated for the form.

RETURN VALUE
       The  function  new_form returns NULL on error.  It sets errno according
       to the function's success:

       E_OK The routine succeeded.

       E_BAD_ARGUMENT
	    Routine detected an incorrect or out-of-range argument.

       E_CONNECTED
	    The field is already connected to a form.

       E_SYSTEM_ERROR
	    System error occurred, e.g., malloc failure.

       The function free_form returns one of the following:

       E_OK The routine succeeded.

       E_BAD_ARGUMENT
	    Routine detected an incorrect or out-of-range argument.

       E_POSTED
	    The form has already been posted.

SEE ALSO
       curses(3X), form(3X).

NOTES
       The  header  file  &ltform.h&gt  automatically  includes  the  header  file
       &ltcurses.h&gt.

PORTABILITY
       These  routines emulate the System V forms library.  They were not sup-
       ported on Version 7 or BSD versions.
