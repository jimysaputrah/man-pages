Getopt::Long::DescriptUser:Contributed Perl Getopt::Long::Descriptive::Opts(3)



NAME
       Getopt::Long::Descriptive::Opts - object representing command line
       switches

VERSION
       version 0.090

DESCRIPTION
       This class is the base class of all $opt objects returned by
       Getopt::Long::Descriptive.  In general, you do not want to think about
       this class, look at it, or alter it.  Seriously, it's pretty dumb.

       Every call to "describe_options" will return a object of a new subclass
       of this class.  It will have a method for the canonical name of each
       option possible given the option specifications.

       Method names beginning with an single underscore are public, and are
       named that way to avoid conflict with automatically generated methods.
       Methods with multiple underscores (in case you're reading the source)
       are private.

METHODS
       Achtung!  All methods beginning with an underscore are experimental as
       of today, 2009-12-12.  They are likely to be formally made permanent
       soon.

   _specified
       This method returns true if the given name was specified on the command
       line.

       For example, if @ARGS was ""--foo --bar 10"" and "baz" is defined by a
       default, "_specified" will return true for foo and bar, and false for
       baz.

   _specified_opts
       This method returns an opt object in which only explicitly specified
       values are defined.  Values which were set by defaults will appear
       undef.

   _complete_opts
       This method returns the opts object with all values, including those
       set by defaults.  It is probably not going to be very often-used.
