NAME
       glReadBuffer - select a color buffer source for pixels


C SPECIFICATION
       void glReadBuffer( GLenum mode )


PARAMETERS
       mode  Specifies	a  color  buffer.   Accepted values are GL_FRONT_LEFT,
	     GL_FRONT_RIGHT, GL_BACK_LEFT, GL_BACK_RIGHT,  GL_FRONT,  GL_BACK,
	     GL_LEFT,  GL_RIGHT,  and  GL_AUXi,  where	i  is  between	0  and
	     GL_AUX_BUFFERS -1.

DESCRIPTION
       glReadBuffer specifies a color buffer  as  the  source  for  subsequent
       glReadPixels,  glCopyTexImage1D, glCopyTexImage2D, glCopyTexSubImage1D,
       glCopyTexSubImage2D, glCopyTexSubImage3D,  and  glCopyPixels  commands.
       mode accepts one of twelve or more predefined values.  (GL_AUX0 through
       GL_AUX3 are always defined.)  In a fully configured  system,  GL_FRONT,
       GL_LEFT,   and	GL_FRONT_LEFT	all   name   the  front  left  buffer,
       GL_FRONT_RIGHT  and  GL_RIGHT  name  the  front	 right	 buffer,   and
       GL_BACK_LEFT and GL_BACK name the back left buffer.

       Nonstereo  double-buffered  configurations have only a front left and a
       back left buffer.  Single-buffered configurations have a front left and
       a  front  right	buffer if stereo, and only a front left buffer if non-
       stereo.	 It  is  an  error  to	specify  a   nonexistent   buffer   to
       glReadBuffer.

       mode  is  initially  GL_FRONT  in  single-buffered  configurations, and
       GL_BACK in double-buffered configurations.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if mode is not one of the twelve (or more)
       accepted values.

       GL_INVALID_OPERATION  is generated if mode specifies a buffer that does
       not exist.

       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if glReadBuffer is  executed  between
       the execution of glBegin and the corresponding execution of glEnd.

ASSOCIATED GETS
       glGet with argument GL_READ_BUFFER
