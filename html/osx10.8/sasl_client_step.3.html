NAME
       sasl_client_step - Perform a step in the authentication negotiation



SYNOPSIS
       #include &ltsasl/sasl.h&gt

       int sasl_client_step(sasl_conn_t *conn,
		      const char *serverin,
		      unsigned serverinlen,
		      sasl_interact_t ** prompt_need,
		      const char ** clientout,
		      unsigned * clientoutlen);


DESCRIPTION
       sasl_client_step()  performs  a step in the authentication negotiation.
       It returns SASL_OK if the whole negotiation is sucessful and  SASL_CON-
       TINUE if this step is ok but at least one more step is needed. A client
       should not assume  an  authentication  negotiation  is  sucessful  just
       because	the  server  signaled success via protocol (i.e. if the server
       said ". OK Authentication succeeded" in	IMAP  sasl_client_step	should
       still be called one more time with a serverinlen of zero.

       If SASL_INTERACT is returned the library needs some values to be filled
       in before it can proceed. The prompt_need structure will be  filled  in
       with  requests.	The application should fulfill these requests and call
       sasl_client_start again	with  identical  parameters  (the  prompt_need
       parameter  will	be  the  same  pointer	as before but filled in by the
       application).

       conn is the SASL connection context

       serverin is the data given by  the  server  (decoded  if  the  protocol
       encodes requests sent over the wire)

       serverinlen is the length of serverin

       clientout  and  clientoutlen  is  created.  It  is  the	initial client
       response to send to the server. It is the job of the client to send  it
       over  the  network to the server.  Any protocal specific encoding (such
       as base64 encoding) necessary needs to be done by the client.


RETURN VALUE
       sasl_client_step returns an integer which corresponds  to  one  of  the
       following codes. SASL_CONTINUE indicates sucess and that there are more
       steps needed in the authentication. SASL_OK indicates that the  authen-
       tication is complete. All other return codes indicate errors and should
       either be handled or the authentication session should be quit.
