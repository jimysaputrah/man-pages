NAME
       glDrawElements - render primitives from array data


C SPECIFICATION
       void glDrawElements( GLenum mode,
			    GLsizei count,
			    GLenum type,
			    const GLvoid *indices )


PARAMETERS
       mode	Specifies  what  kind  of primitives to render.  Symbolic con-
		stants	GL_POINTS,  GL_LINE_STRIP,   GL_LINE_LOOP,   GL_LINES,
		GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP,	  GL_TRIANGLE_FAN,	 GL_TRIANGLES,
		GL_QUAD_STRIP, GL_QUADS, and GL_POLYGON are accepted.

       count	Specifies the number of elements to be rendered.

       type	Specifies the type of the values in indices. Must  be  one  of
		GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT, or GL_UNSIGNED_INT.

       indices	Specifies  a  pointer  to  the	location where the indices are
		stored.

DESCRIPTION
       glDrawElements specifies multiple geometric primitives  with  very  few
       subroutine  calls.  Instead of calling a GL function to pass each indi-
       vidual vertex, normal, texture coordinate, edge flag, or color, you can
       prespecify separate arrays of vertices, normals, and so on and use them
       to  construct  a  sequence  of  primitives  with  a  single   call   to
       glDrawElements.

       When  glDrawElements  is called, it uses count sequential elements from
       an enabled array, starting at indices to construct a sequence  of  geo-
       metric  primitives.  mode  specifies  what  kind of primitives are con-
       structed, and how the array elements  construct	these  primitives.  If
       more than one array is enabled, each is used. If GL_VERTEX_ARRAY is not
       enabled, no geometric primitives are constructed.

       Vertex attributes that are modified by glDrawElements have an  unspeci-
       fied value after glDrawElements returns. For example, if GL_COLOR_ARRAY
       is  enabled,  the  value  of  the  current  color  is  undefined  after
       glDrawElements executes. Attributes that aren't modified maintain their
       previous values.

NOTES
       glDrawElements is available only if the GL version is 1.1 or greater.

       glDrawElements is included  in  display	lists.	If  glDrawElements  is
       entered	into  a  display list, the necessary array data (determined by
       the array pointers and enables) is also entered into the display  list.
       Because	the  array  pointers  and enables are client-side state, their
       values affect display lists when the lists are created,	not  when  the
       lists are executed.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if mode is not an accepted value.

       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if count is negative.

       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if glDrawElements is executed between
       the execution of glBegin and the corresponding glEnd.

SEE ALSO
       glArrayElement,	glColorPointer,   glDrawArrays,   glDrawRangeElements,
       glEdgeFlagPointer,  glGetPointerv, glIndexPointer, glInterleavedArrays,
       glNormalPointer, glTexCoordPointer, glVertexPointer
