NAME
       img-ppm - Img, Portable Pixmap format (ppm)

SYNOPSIS
       package require Tk

       package require img::ppm  ?1.4?

       image create photo ?name? ?options?

_________________________________________________________________

DESCRIPTION
       The  package  img::ppm  is  a sub-package of Img. It can be loaded as a
       part of the complete Img support, via package require Img,  or  on  its
       own, via package require img::ppm.

       Like  all packages of Img it does not provide new commands, but extends
       the existing Tk command image so  that  it  supports  files  containing
       raster  images  in  the Portable Pixmap format (ppm). More specifically
       img::ppm extends Tk's photo image type.

       The name of the new format handler is ppm.  This handler provides addi-
       tional configuration options. See section PPM OPTIONS for more detailed
       explanations.

       All of the above means that in a call like

       image create photo ?name? ?options?


       [1]    Image data in ppm format (options -data and -file)  is  detected
	      automatically.

       [2]    The  format  name  ppm  is recognized by the option -format.  In
	      addition the value for the option is treated  as	list  and  may
	      contain  any  of	the  special  options  listed  in  section PPM
	      OPTIONS.


SUPPORTED PPM TYPES
       This handler supports the PPM (Truecolor)  and  PGM  (Greyscale)  image
       formats.  There are two types of PPM/PGM files: RAW (binary) and ASCII.
       The values stored in PPM/PGM files can be unsigned  8-bit  or  unsigned
       16-bit values.


	Grayscale (PGM): 8-bit and 16-bit, 1 channel per pixel.
	Truecolor (PPM): 8-bit and 16-bit, 3 channels per pixel.

	List of currently supported features:

	Type		  |	Read	  |	Write	  |
			  | -file | -data | -file | -data |
	---------------------------------------------------
	PGM  8-bit ASCII  | Yes   | Yes   | No	  | No	  |
	PGM  8-bit BINARY | Yes   | Yes   | No	  | No	  |
	PGM 16-bit ASCII  | Yes   | Yes   | No	  | No	  |
	PGM 16-bit BINARY | Yes   | Yes   | No	  | No	  |
	PPM  8-bit ASCII  | Yes   | Yes   | Yes   | Yes   |
	PPM  8-bit BINARY | Yes   | Yes   | Yes   | Yes   |
	PPM 16-bit ASCII  | Yes   | Yes   | No	  | No	  |
	PPM 16-bit BINARY | Yes   | Yes   | No	  | No	  |



PPM OPTIONS
       The handler provides the following options:

       -verbose bool
	      This option is supported for reading and writing.

	      If  set  to true, additional information about the loaded/stored
	      image is printed to stdout. Default is false.

       -scanorder string
	      This option is supported for reading only.

	      Specify the scanline order of the input image.  Possible values:
	      TopDown or BottomUp. Default is TopDown.

       -gamma float
	      This option is supported for reading only.

	      Specify  a  gamma  correction  to be applied when mapping 16-bit
	      input data to 8-bit image values.  Default is 1.0.

       -min float
	      This option is supported for reading only.

	      Specify the minimum pixel value to be used  for  mapping	16-bit
	      input  data to 8-bit image values.  Default is the minimum value
	      found in the image data.

       -max float
	      This option is supported for reading only.

	      Specify the maximum pixel value to be used  for  mapping	16-bit
	      input  data to 8-bit image values.  Default is the maximum value
	      found in the image data.

       -ascii bool
	      This option is supported for writing only.  If set to true,  the
	      file  is	written  in  PPM  8-bit ASCII format (P3).  Default is
	      false, i.e. write in PPM 8-bit binary format (P6).
