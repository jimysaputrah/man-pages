CLOSE(7)		PostgreSQL 9.1.4 Documentation		      CLOSE(7)



NAME
       CLOSE - close a cursor

SYNOPSIS
       CLOSE { name | ALL }

DESCRIPTION
       CLOSE frees the resources associated with an open cursor. After the
       cursor is closed, no subsequent operations are allowed on it. A cursor
       should be closed when it is no longer needed.

       Every non-holdable open cursor is implicitly closed when a transaction
       is terminated by COMMIT or ROLLBACK. A holdable cursor is implicitly
       closed if the transaction that created it aborts via ROLLBACK. If the
       creating transaction successfully commits, the holdable cursor remains
       open until an explicit CLOSE is executed, or the client disconnects.

PARAMETERS
       name
	   The name of an open cursor to close.

       ALL
	   Close all open cursors.

NOTES
       PostgreSQL does not have an explicit OPEN cursor statement; a cursor is
       considered open when it is declared. Use the DECLARE(7) statement to
       declare a cursor.

       You can see all available cursors by querying the pg_cursors system
       view.

       If a cursor is closed after a savepoint which is later rolled back, the
       CLOSE is not rolled back; that is, the cursor remains closed.

EXAMPLES
       Close the cursor liahona:

	   CLOSE liahona;

COMPATIBILITY
       CLOSE is fully conforming with the SQL standard.  CLOSE ALL is a
       PostgreSQL extension.
