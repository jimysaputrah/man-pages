NAME
       glFinish - block until all GL execution is complete

C SPECIFICATION
       void glFinish(void);

DESCRIPTION
       glFinish does not return until the effects of all previously called GL
       commands are complete. Such effects include all changes to GL state,
       all changes to connection state, and all changes to the frame buffer
       contents.

NOTES
       glFinish requires a round trip to the server.
