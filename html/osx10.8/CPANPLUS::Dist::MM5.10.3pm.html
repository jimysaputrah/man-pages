NAME
       CPANPLUS::Dist::MM

SYNOPSIS
	   $mm = CPANPLUS::Dist::MM-&gtnew( module =&gt $modobj );

	   $mm-&gtcreate;        # runs make && make test
	   $mm-&gtinstall;       # runs make install

DESCRIPTION
       "CPANPLUS::Dist::MM" is a distribution class for MakeMaker related
       modules.  Using this package, you can create, install and uninstall
       perl modules. It inherits from "CPANPLUS::Dist".

ACCESSORS
       parent()
	   Returns the "CPANPLUS::Module" object that parented this object.

       status()
	   Returns the "Object::Accessor" object that keeps the status for
	   this module.

STATUS ACCESSORS
       All accessors can be accessed as follows:
	   $mm-&gtstatus-&gtACCESSOR

       makefile ()
	   Location of the Makefile (or Build file).  Set to 0 explicitly if
	   something went wrong.

       make ()
	   BOOL indicating if the "make" (or "Build") command was successful.

       test ()
	   BOOL indicating if the "make test" (or "Build test") command was
	   successful.

       prepared ()
	   BOOL indicating if the "prepare" call exited succesfully This gets
	   set after "perl Makefile.PL"

       distdir ()
	   Full path to the directory in which the "prepare" call took place,
	   set after a call to "prepare".

       created ()
	   BOOL indicating if the "create" call exited succesfully. This gets
	   set after "make" and "make test".

       installed ()
	   BOOL indicating if the module was installed. This gets set after
	   "make install" (or "Build install") exits successfully.

       uninstalled ()
	   BOOL indicating if the module was uninstalled properly.

       _create_args ()
	   Storage of the arguments passed to "create" for this object. Used
	   for recursive calls when satisfying prerequisites.

       _install_args ()
	   Storage of the arguments passed to "install" for this object. Used
	   for recursive calls when satisfying prerequisites.

METHODS
   $bool = $dist-&gtformat_available();
       Returns a boolean indicating whether or not you can use this package to
       create and install modules in your environment.

       Sets up the "CPANPLUS::Dist::MM" object for use.  Effectively creates
       all the needed status accessors.

       Called automatically whenever you create a new "CPANPLUS::Dist" object.

       "prepare" preps a distribution for installation. This means it will run
       "perl Makefile.PL" and determine what prerequisites this distribution
       declared.

       If you set "force" to true, it will go over all the stages of the
       "prepare" process again, ignoring any previously cached results.

       When running "perl Makefile.PL", the environment variable
       "PERL5_CPANPLUS_IS_EXECUTING" will be set to the full path of the
       "Makefile.PL" that is being executed. This enables any code inside the
       "Makefile.PL" to know that it is being installed via CPANPLUS.

       Returns true on success and false on failure.

       You may then call "$dist-&gtcreate" on the object to create the
       installable files.

   $href = $dist-&gt_find_prereqs( file =&gt '/path/to/Makefile', [verbose =&gt
       BOOL])
       Parses a "Makefile" for "PREREQ_PM" entries and distills from that any
       prerequisites mentioned in the "Makefile"

       Returns a hash with module-version pairs on success and false on
       failure.

   $bool = $dist-&gtcreate([perl =&gt '/path/to/perl', make =&gt '/path/to/make',
       makeflags =&gt 'EXTRA=FLAGS', prereq_target =&gt TARGET, skiptest =&gt BOOL,
       force =&gt BOOL, verbose =&gt BOOL])
       "create" creates the files necessary for installation. This means it
       will run "make" and "make test".  This will also scan for and attempt
       to satisfy any prerequisites the module may have.

       If you set "skiptest" to true, it will skip the "make test" stage.  If
       you set "force" to true, it will go over all the stages of the "make"
       process again, ignoring any previously cached results. It will also
       ignore a bad return value from "make test" and still allow the
       operation to return true.

       Returns true on success and false on failure.

       You may then call "$dist-&gtinstall" on the object to actually install
       it.

   $bool = $dist-&gtinstall([make =&gt '/path/to/make',  makemakerflags =&gt
       'EXTRA=FLAGS', force =&gt BOOL, verbose =&gt BOOL])
       "install" runs the following command:
	   make install

       Returns true on success, false on failure.

   $bool = $dist-&gtwrite_makefile_pl([force =&gt BOOL, verbose =&gt BOOL])
       This routine can write a "Makefile.PL" from the information in a module
       object. It is used to write a "Makefile.PL" when the original author
       forgot it (!!).

       Returns 1 on success and false on failure.

       The file gets written to the directory the module's been extracted to.
