NAME
       glCompressedTexImage1D - specify a one-dimensional texture image in a
       compressed format

C SPECIFICATION
       void glCompressedTexImage1D(GLenum target, GLint level,
				   GLenum internalformat, GLsizei width,
				   GLint border, GLsizei imageSize,
				   const GLvoid * data);

PARAMETERS
       target
	   Specifies the target texture. Must be GL_TEXTURE_1D or
	   GL_PROXY_TEXTURE_1D.

       level
	   Specifies the level-of-detail number. Level 0 is the base image
	   level. Level n is the nth mipmap reduction image.

       internalformat
	   Specifies the format of the compressed image data stored at address
	   data.

       width
	   Specifies the width of the texture image. All implementations
	   support texture images that are at least 64 texels wide. The height
	   of the 1D texture image is 1.

       border
	   This value must be 0.

       imageSize
	   Specifies the number of unsigned bytes of image data starting at
	   the address specified by data.

       data
	   Specifies a pointer to the compressed image data in memory.

DESCRIPTION
       Texturing allows elements of an image array to be read by shaders.


       glCompressedTexImage1D loads a previously defined, and retrieved,
       compressed one-dimensional texture image if target is GL_TEXTURE_1D
       (see glTexImage1D()).

       If target is GL_PROXY_TEXTURE_1D, no data is read from data, but all of
       the texture image state is recalculated, checked for consistency, and
       checked against the implementation's capabilities. If the
       implementation cannot handle a texture of the requested texture size,
       it sets all of the image state to 0, but does not generate an error
       (see glGetError()). To query for an entire mipmap array, use an image
       array level greater than or equal to 1.


       internalformat must be an extension-specified compressed-texture
       format. When a texture is loaded with glTexImage1D() using a generic
       compressed texture format (e.g., GL_COMPRESSED_RGB) the GL selects from
       one of its extensions supporting compressed textures. In order to load
       the compressed texture image using glCompressedTexImage1D, query the
       compressed texture image's size and format using
       glGetTexLevelParameter().

       If a non-zero named buffer object is bound to the
       GL_PIXEL_UNPACK_BUFFER target (see glBindBuffer()) while a texture
       image is specified, data is treated as a byte offset into the buffer
       object's data store.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if internalformat is not a supported
       specific compressed internal formats, or is one of the generic
       compressed internal formats: GL_COMPRESSED_RED, GL_COMPRESSED_RG,
       GL_COMPRESSED_RGB, GL_COMPRESSED_RGBA.  GL_COMPRESSED_SRGB, or
       GL_COMPRESSED_SRGB_ALPHA.


       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if imageSize is not consistent with the
       format, dimensions, and contents of the specified compressed image
       data.


       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if border is not 0.


       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if parameter combinations are not
       supported by the specific compressed internal format as specified in
       the specific texture compression extension.


       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if a non-zero buffer object name is
       bound to the GL_PIXEL_UNPACK_BUFFER target and the buffer object's data
       store is currently mapped.


       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if a non-zero buffer object name is
       bound to the GL_PIXEL_UNPACK_BUFFER target and the data would be
       unpacked from the buffer object such that the memory reads required
       would exceed the data store size.

       Undefined results, including abnormal program termination, are
       generated if data is not encoded in a manner consistent with the
       extension specification defining the internal compression format.
