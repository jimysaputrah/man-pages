NAME
     wordexp -- perform shell-style word expansions

SYNOPSIS
     #include &ltwordexp.h&gt

     int
     wordexp(const char *restrict words, wordexp_t *restrict pwordexp,
	 int flags);

     void
     wordfree(wordexp_t *pwordexp);

DESCRIPTION
     The wordexp() function performs shell-style word expansion on words.  It
     places the list of words into the we_wordv member of pwordexp and the
     number of words into we_wordc.

     The flags argument (see BUGS) is the bitwise inclusive OR of any of the
     following constants:

     WRDE_APPEND   Append the words to those generated by a previous call to
		   wordexp().

     WRDE_DOOFS    As many NULL pointers as are specified by the we_offs mem-
		   ber of pwordexp are added to the front of we_wordv.

     WRDE_NOCMD    Disallow command substitution in words.  See the note in
		   BUGS before using this.

     WRDE_REUSE    The pwordexp argument was passed to a previous successful
		   call to wordexp() but has not been passed to wordfree().
		   The implementation may reuse the space allocated to it.

     WRDE_SHOWERR  Do not redirect shell error messages to /dev/null.

     WRDE_UNDEF    Report error on an attempt to expand an undefined shell
		   variable.

     The wordexp_t structure is defined in &ltwordexp.h&gt as:

	   typedef struct {
		   size_t  we_wordc;	   /* count of words matched */
		   char    **we_wordv;	   /* pointer to list of words */
		   size_t  we_offs;	   /* slots to reserve in we_wordv */
	   } wordexp_t;

     The wordfree() function frees the memory allocated by wordexp().

RETURN VALUES
     The wordexp() function returns zero if successful, otherwise it returns
     one of the following error codes:

     WRDE_BADCHAR  The words argument contains one of the following unquoted
		   characters: &ltnewline&gt, `|', `&', `;', `&lt', `&gt', `(', `)',
		   `{', `}'.

     WRDE_BADVAL   An attempt was made to expand an undefined shell variable
		   and WRDE_UNDEF is set in flags.

     WRDE_CMDSUB   An attempt was made to use command substitution and
		   WRDE_NOCMD is set in flags.

     WRDE_NOSPACE  Not enough memory to store the result.

     WRDE_SYNTAX   Shell syntax error in words.

     The wordfree() function returns no value.

EXAMPLES
     Invoke the editor on all .c files in the current directory and /etc/motd
     (error checking omitted):

	   wordexp_t pwordexp;

	   wordexp("${EDITOR:-vi} *.c /etc/motd", &pwordexp, 0);
	   execvp(pwordexp-&gtwe_wordv[0], pwordexp-&gtwe_wordv);

BUGS
     This version of wordexp() ignores the value of the flags argument.
