NAME
       SECURITY_LABEL - define or change a security label applied to an object

SYNOPSIS
       SECURITY LABEL [ FOR provider ] ON
       {
	 TABLE object_name |
	 COLUMN table_name.column_name |
	 AGGREGATE agg_name (agg_type [, ...] ) |
	 DOMAIN object_name |
	 FOREIGN TABLE object_name
	 FUNCTION function_name ( [ [ argmode ] [ argname ] argtype [, ...] ] ) |
	 LARGE OBJECT large_object_oid |
	 [ PROCEDURAL ] LANGUAGE object_name |
	 SCHEMA object_name |
	 SEQUENCE object_name |
	 TYPE object_name |
	 VIEW object_name
       } IS 'label'

DESCRIPTION
       SECURITY LABEL applies a security label to a database object. An
       arbitrary number of security labels, one per label provider, can be
       associated with a given database object. Label providers are loadable
       modules which register themselves by using the function
       register_label_provider.

	   Note
	   register_label_provider is not an SQL function; it can only be
	   called from C code loaded into the backend.

       The label provider determines whether a given label is valid and
       whether it is permissible to assign that label to a given object. The
       meaning of a given label is likewise at the discretion of the label
       provider.  PostgreSQL places no restrictions on whether or how a label
       provider must interpret security labels; it merely provides a mechanism
       for storing them. In practice, this facility is intended to allow
       integration with label-based mandatory access control (MAC) systems
       such as SE-Linux. Such systems make all access control decisions based
       on object labels, rather than traditional discretionary access control
       (DAC) concepts such as users and groups.

PARAMETERS
       object_name, table_name.column_name, agg_name, function_name
	   The name of the object to be labeled. Names of tables, aggregates,
	   domains, foreign tables, functions, sequences, types, and views can
	   be schema-qualified.

       provider
	   The name of the provider with which this label is to be associated.
	   The named provider must be loaded and must consent to the proposed
	   labeling operation. If exactly one provider is loaded, the provider
	   name may be omitted for brevity.

       arg_type
	   An input data type on which the aggregate function operates. To
	   reference a zero-argument aggregate function, write * in place of
	   the list of input data types.

       argmode
	   The mode of a function argument: IN, OUT, INOUT, or VARIADIC. If
	   omitted, the default is IN. Note that SECURITY LABEL ON FUNCTION
	   does not actually pay any attention to OUT arguments, since only
	   the input arguments are needed to determine the function's
	   identity. So it is sufficient to list the IN, INOUT, and VARIADIC
	   arguments.

       argname
	   The name of a function argument. Note that SECURITY LABEL ON
	   FUNCTION does not actually pay any attention to argument names,
	   since only the argument data types are needed to determine the
	   function's identity.

       argtype
	   The data type(s) of the function's arguments (optionally
	   schema-qualified), if any.

       large_object_oid
	   The OID of the large object.

       PROCEDURAL
	   This is a noise word.

       label
	   The new security label, written as a string literal; or NULL to
	   drop the security label.

EXAMPLES
       The following example shows how the security label of a table might be
       changed.

	   SECURITY LABEL FOR selinux ON TABLE mytable IS 'system_u:object_r:sepgsql_table_t:s0';

COMPATIBILITY
       There is no SECURITY LABEL command in the SQL standard.
