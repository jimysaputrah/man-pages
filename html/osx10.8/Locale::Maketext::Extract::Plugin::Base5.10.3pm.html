NAME
       Locale::Maketext::Extract::Plugin::Base - Base module for format parser
       plugins

SYNOPSIS
	   package My::Parser::Plugin;
	   use base qw(Locale::Maketext::Extract::Plugin::Base);

	   sub file_types {
	       return [qw( ext ext2 )]
	   }

	   sub extract {
	       my $self = shift;
	       my $filename = shift;
	       local $_ = shift;

	       my $line = 1;

	       while (my $found = $self->routine_to_extract_strings) {
		   $self->add_entry($str,[$filename,$line,$vars])
	       }

	       return;
	   }

DESCRIPTION
       All format parser plugins in Locale::Maketext::Extract inherit from
       Locale::Maketext::Extract::Plugin::Base.

       If you want to write your own custom parser plugin, you will need to
       inherit from this module, and provide "file_types()" and "extract()"
       methods, as shown above.

METHODS
       new()
	       $plugin = My::Parser->new(
		   @file_types	       # Optionally specify a list of recognised file types
	       )

       add_entry()
	       $plugin->add_entry($str,$line,$vars)

       "entries()"
	       $entries = $plugin->entries;

       "clear()"
	       $plugin->clear

	   Clears all stored entries.

       file_types()
	       @default_file_types = $plugin->file_types

	   Returns a list of recognised file types that your module knows how
	   to parse.

	   Each file type can be one of:

	   o   A plain string

		  'pl'	=> base filename is matched against qr/\.pl$/
		  '*'	=> all files are accepted

	   o   A regex

		  qr/\.tt2?\./ => base filename is matched against this regex

	   o   A codref

		   sub {}  => this codref is called as $coderef->($base_filename,$path_to_file)
			      It should return true or false

       extract()
	       $plugin->extract($filecontents);

	   extract() is the method that will be called to process the contents
	   of the current file.

	   When it finds a string that should be extracted, it should call

	      $self->add_entry($string,$line,$vars])

	   where $vars refers to any arguments that are being passed to the
	   localise function. For instance:

	      l("You found [quant,_1,file,files]",files_found)

		string: "You found [quant,_1,file,files]"
		vars  : (files_found)

	   IMPORTANT: a single plugin instance is used for all files, so if
	   you plan on storing state information in the $plugin object, this
	   should be cleared out at the beginning of "extract()"

       known_file_type()
	       if ($plugin->known_file_type($filename_with_path)) {
		   ....
	       }

	   Determines whether the current file should be handled by this
	   parser, based either on the list of file_types speficied when this
	   object was created, or the default file_types specified in the
	   module.

	   and perl source files.
