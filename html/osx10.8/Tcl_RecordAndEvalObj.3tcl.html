NAME
       Tcl_RecordAndEvalObj - save command on history list before evaluating

SYNOPSIS
       #include <tcl.h>

       int
       Tcl_RecordAndEvalObj(interp, cmdPtr, flags)

ARGUMENTS
       Tcl_Interp *interp (in)		Tcl  interpreter  in which to evaluate
					command.

       Tcl_Obj *cmdPtr (in)		Points to a Tcl  object  containing  a
					command  (or  sequence of commands) to
					execute.

       int flags (in)			An OR'ed  combination  of  flag  bits.
					TCL_NO_EVAL  means  record the command

DESCRIPTION
       Tcl_RecordAndEvalObj  is invoked to record a command as an event on the
       history list and then execute it using Tcl_EvalObjEx  (or  Tcl_GlobalE-
       valObj  if the TCL_EVAL_GLOBAL bit is set in flags).  It returns a com-
       pletion code such as TCL_OK just  like  Tcl_EvalObjEx,  as  well  as  a
       result  object  containing  additional  information  (a result value or
       error message) that can be retrieved using Tcl_GetObjResult.  If you do
       not  want  the  command	recorded  on  the history list then you should
       invoke  Tcl_EvalObjEx  instead	of   Tcl_RecordAndEvalObj.    Normally
       Tcl_RecordAndEvalObj  is  only  called with top-level commands typed by
       the user, since the purpose of history is to allow the user to re-issue
       recently   invoked  commands.   If  the	flags  argument  contains  the
       TCL_NO_EVAL bit then the command is recorded without being evaluated.
