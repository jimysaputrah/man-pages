NAME
       ExtUtils::MM_VMS - methods to override UN*X behaviour in
       ExtUtils::MakeMaker

SYNOPSIS
	 Do not use this directly.
	 Instead, use ExtUtils::MM and it will figure out which MM_*
	 class to use for you.

DESCRIPTION
       See ExtUtils::MM_Unix for a documentation of the methods provided
       there. This package overrides the implementation of these methods, not
       the semantics.

   Methods always loaded
       wraplist
	   Converts a list into a string wrapped at approximately 80 columns.

   Methods
       Those methods which override default MM_Unix methods are marked
       "(override)", while methods unique to MM_VMS are marked "(specific)".
       For overridden methods, documentation is limited to an explanation of
       why this method overrides the MM_Unix method; see the ExtUtils::MM_Unix
       documentation for more details.

       guess_name (override)
	   Try to determine name of extension being built.  We begin with the
	   name of the current directory.  Since VMS filenames are case-
	   insensitive, however, we look for a .pm file whose name matches
	   that of the current directory (presumably the 'main' .pm file for
	   this extension), and try to find a "package" statement from which
	   to obtain the Mixed::Case package name.

       find_perl (override)
	   Use VMS file specification syntax and CLI commands to find and
	   invoke Perl images.

       maybe_command (override)
	   Follows VMS naming conventions for executable files.  If the name
	   passed in doesn't exactly match an executable file, appends .Exe
	   (or equivalent) to check for executable image, and .Com to check
	   for DCL procedure.  If this fails, checks directories in DCL$PATH
	   and finally Sys$System: for an executable file having the name
	   specified, with or without the .Exe-equivalent suffix.

       pasthru (override)
	   VMS has $(MMSQUALIFIERS) which is a listing of all the original
	   command line options.  This is used in every invocation of make in
	   the VMS Makefile so PASTHRU should not be necessary.  Using PASTHRU
	   tends to blow commands past the 256 character limit.

       pm_to_blib (override)
	   VMS wants a dot in every file so we can't have one called
	   'pm_to_blib', it becomes 'pm_to_blib.' and MMS/K isn't smart enough
	   to know that when you have a target called 'pm_to_blib' it should
	   look for 'pm_to_blib.'.

	   So in VMS its pm_to_blib.ts.

       perl_script (override)
	   If name passed in doesn't specify a readable file, appends .com or
	   .pl and tries again, since it's customary to have file types on all
	   files under VMS.

       replace_manpage_separator
	   Use as separator a character which is legal in a VMS-syntax file
	   name.

       init_DEST
	   (override) Because of the difficulty concatenating VMS filepaths we
	   must pre-expand the DEST* variables.

       init_DIRFILESEP
	   No seperator between a directory path and a filename on VMS.

       init_main (override)
       init_others (override)
	   Provide VMS-specific forms of various utility commands, then hand
	   off to the default MM_Unix method.

	   DEV_NULL should probably be overriden with something.

	   Also changes EQUALIZE_TIMESTAMP to set revision date of target file
	   to one second later than source file, since MMK interprets
	   precisely equal revision dates for a source and target file as a
	   sign that the target needs to be updated.

       init_platform (override)
	   Add PERL_VMS, MM_VMS_REVISION and MM_VMS_VERSION.

	   MM_VMS_REVISION is for backwards compatibility before MM_VMS had a
	   $VERSION.

       platform_constants
       init_VERSION (override)
	   Override the *DEFINE_VERSION macros with VMS semantics.  Translate
	   the MAKEMAKER filepath to VMS style.

       constants (override)
	   Fixes up numerous file and directory macros to insure VMS syntax
	   regardless of input syntax.	Also makes lists of files comma-
	   separated.

       special_targets
	   Clear the default .SUFFIXES and put in our own list.

       cflags (override)
	   Bypass shell script and produce qualifiers for CC directly (but
	   warn user if a shell script for this extension exists).  Fold
	   multiple /Defines into one, since some C compilers pay attention to
	   only one instance of this qualifier on the command line.

       const_cccmd (override)
	   Adds directives to point C preprocessor to the right place when
	   handling #include &ltsys/foo.h&gt directives.  Also constructs CC
	   command line a bit differently than MM_Unix method.

       tools_other (override)
	   Throw in some dubious extra macros for Makefile args.

	   Also keep around the old $(SAY) macro in case somebody's using it.

       init_dist (override)
	   VMSish defaults for some values.

	     macro	   description			   default

	     ZIPFLAGS	   flags to pass to ZIP 	   -Vu

	     COMPRESS	   compression command to	   gzip
			   use for tarfiles
	     SUFFIX	   suffix to put on		   -gz
			   compressed files

	     SHAR	   shar command to use		   vms_share

	     DIST_DEFAULT  default target to use to	   tardist
			   create a distribution

	     DISTVNAME	   Use VERSION_SYM instead of	   $(DISTNAME)-$(VERSION_SYM)
			   VERSION for the name

       c_o (override)
	   Use VMS syntax on command line.  In particular, $(DEFINE) and
	   $(PERL_INC) have been pulled into $(CCCMD).	Also use MM[SK]
	   macros.

       xs_c (override)
	   Use MM[SK] macros.

       xs_o (override)
	   Use MM[SK] macros, and VMS command line for C compiler.

       dlsyms (override)
	   Create VMS linker options files specifying universal symbols for
	   this extension's shareable image, and listing other shareable
	   images or libraries to which it should be linked.

       dynamic_lib (override)
	   Use VMS Link command.

       static_lib (override)
	   Use VMS commands to manipulate object library.

       extra_clean_files
	   Clean up some OS specific files.  Plus the temp file used to
	   shorten a lot of commands.

       zipfile_target
       tarfile_target
       shdist_target
	   Syntax for invoking shar, tar and zip differs from that for Unix.

       install (override)
	   Work around DCL's 255 character limit several times,and use VMS-
	   style command line quoting in a few cases.

       perldepend (override)
	   Use VMS-style syntax for files; it's cheaper to just do it directly
	   here than to have the MM_Unix method call "catfile" repeatedly.
	   Also, if we have to rebuild Config.pm, use MM[SK] to do it.

       makeaperl (override)
	   Undertake to build a new set of Perl images using VMS commands.
	   Since VMS does dynamic loading, it's not necessary to statically
	   link each extension into the Perl image, so this isn't the normal
	   build path.	Consequently, it hasn't really been tested, and may
	   well be incomplete.

       maketext_filter (override)
	   Insure that colons marking targets are preceded by space, in order
	   to distinguish the target delimiter from a colon appearing as part
	   of a filespec.

       prefixify (override)
	   prefixifying on VMS is simple.  Each should simply be:

	       perl_root:[some.dir]

	   which can just be converted to:

	       volume:[your.prefix.some.dir]

	   otherwise you get the default layout.

	   In effect, your search prefix is ignored and $Config{vms_prefix} is
	   used instead.

       cd
       oneliner
       echo
	   perl trips up on "&ltfoo&gt" thinking it's an input redirect.  So we
	   use the native Write command instead.  Besides, its faster.

       quote_literal
       escape_newlines
       max_exec_len
	   256 characters.

       init_linker
       catdir (override)
       catfile (override)
	   Eliminate the macros in the output to the MMS/MMK file.

	   (File::Spec::VMS used to do this for us, but it's being removed)

       eliminate_macros
	   Expands MM[KS]/Make macros in a text string, using the contents of
	   identically named elements of %$self, and returns the result as a
	   file specification in Unix syntax.

	   NOTE:  This is the canonical version of the method.	The version in
	   File::Spec::VMS is deprecated.

       fixpath
	      my $path = $mm-&gtfixpath($path);
	      my $path = $mm-&gtfixpath($path, $is_dir);

	   Catchall routine to clean up problem MM[SK]/Make macros.  Expands
	   macros in any directory specification, in order to avoid
	   juxtaposing two VMS-syntax directories when MM[SK] is run.  Also
	   expands expressions which are all macro, so that we can tell how
	   long the expansion is, and avoid overrunning DCL's command buffer
	   when MM[KS] is running.

	   fixpath() checks to see whether the result matches the name of a
	   directory in the current default directory and returns a directory
	   or file specification accordingly.  $is_dir can be set to true to
	   force fixpath() to consider the path to be a directory or false to
	   force it to be a file.

	   NOTE:  This is the canonical version of the method.	The version in
	   File::Spec::VMS is deprecated.

       os_flavor
	   VMS is VMS.
