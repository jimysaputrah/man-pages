NAME
     libgmalloc.dylib -- (Guard Malloc), an aggressive debugging malloc
     library

DESCRIPTION
     libgmalloc is a debugging malloc library that can track down insidious
     bugs in your code or library.  If your application crashes when using
     libgmalloc, then you've found a bug.

     libgmalloc uses the virtual memory system to identify such bugs.  Each
     malloc allocation is placed on its own virtual memory page, with the end
     of the buffer at the end of the page's memory, and the next page is kept
     unallocated.  As a result, accesses beyond the end of the buffer cause a
     bus error immediately.  When memory is freed, libgmalloc deallocates its
     virtual memory, causing reads or writes to the freed buffer cause a bus
     error.  Thus, nasty, hard-to-track-down bugs are immediately obvious, and
     you'll know exactly which code is causing the problem.  This is thread-
     safe and works for all uses of malloc(), NSZoneMalloc(), and friends.

     As of Mac OS X 10.5, libgmalloc aligns the start of allocated buffers on
     16-byte boundaries by default, to allow proper use of vector instructions
     (e.g., SSE or Altivec).  (The use of vector instructions is becoming more
     common, including in some Mac OS X system libraries.  The regular system
     malloc also uses 16-byte alignment.)  Because of this 16-byte alignment,
     up to 15 bytes at the end of an allocated block may be excess at the end
     of the page, and libgmalloc will not detect buffer overruns into that
     area by default.  This default alignment can be changed with environment
     variables.

     libgmalloc is available in /usr/lib/libgmalloc.dylib.  To use it, set
     this environment variable:

	   set DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES to /usr/lib/libgmalloc.dylib

     Note:  it is no longer necessary to set DYLD_FORCE_FLAT_NAMESPACE.

     This tells dyld to use Guard Malloc instead of the standard version of
     malloc.  Run the program, and wait for the crash indicating the bad
     access.  When the program crashes, examine it in the debugger to identify
     the cause.

     As of Mac OS X 10.6, libgmalloc can be used with the standard malloc
     stack logging by setting the MallocStackLogging environment variable.
     The malloc_history(1) command can then be used to show backtraces of all
     malloc and free events made when using libgmalloc.

USING libgmalloc WITH THE XCODE DEBUGGER OR GDB
     Because the goal of libgmalloc is to "encourage" your application to
     crash if memory access errors occur, it is best to run your application
     under a debugger such as the Xcode IDE's debugger, or gdb at the command
     line.

     To use Guard Malloc with the Xcode debugger, choose the "Enable Guard
     Malloc" menu item from the Debug menu before launching your executable
     for debugging.  That automatically sets the environment variables prop-
     erly.  Xcode retains that setting with that executable.  If you need to
     set any of the additional environment variables described below, select
     your executable in the Groups & Files outline, then bring up the Exe-
     cutable Inspector.  Choose the Arguments tab, and add the environment
     variable to the environment variables list.

     If you're using gdb from the command line, use gdb's 'set env' command to
     set the environment variables.

EXAMPLE
     % cat gmalloctest.c
     #include &ltstdlib.h&gt
     #include &ltstdio.h&gt

     main()
     {
       unsigned *buffer = (unsigned *)malloc(sizeof(unsigned) * 100);
       unsigned i;

       for (i = 0; i &lt 200; i++) {
	 buffer[i] = i;
       }

       for (i = 0; i &lt 200; i++) {
	 printf ("%d  ", buffer[i]);
       }
     }

     % cc -g -o gmalloctest gmalloctest.c
     % gdb gmalloctest

     Once you have the backtrace, you can examine that line of source code to
     see what variable would have been accessed, and determine why that value
     would have been invalid memory.  If you looked at the source for the
     example above, you might find that this function looks one character too
     far beyond the string it's operating on and causes a bus error when
     accessing the protected page following the string.

     These sorts of problems may seem minor, especially when the application
     normally behaves correctly.  However, they're usually the hallmark of
     intermittent bugs or unexplained crashes in long running programs.  In
     normal use, the bug in the example program might have caused no problems
     at all... or it might have trashed the following buffer, leading occa-
     sionally to corrupted data.  If the application had been referencing
     freed memory, the program might have worked fine until the one time where
     the freed memory was immediately reused and modified.

ENVIRONMENT
     libgmalloc's behavior can be changed with several additional environment
     variables:

     MALLOC_PROTECT_BEFORE	    If this flag is set, then libgmalloc tries
				    harder to detect buffer underruns.
				    Specifically, libgmalloc places the mal-
				    loc-allocated buffer at the beginning of a
				    virtual memory page, then protects the
				    page before.  Buffer underruns then cause
				    an error.  The behavior without this vari-
				    able set would be to place the buffer at
				    the end of the page, and protect the page
				    after.

     MALLOC_FILL_SPACE		    This flag causes libgmalloc to fill the
				    buffer with 0x55 upon creation.  This can
				    help catch uninitialized memory problems.

     MALLOC_ALLOW_READS 	    This flag allows the guard page after the
				    buffer to be readable so that reads past
				    the ends of buffers do not cause the pro-
				    gram to crash.  With the MALLOC_PRO-
				    TECT_BEFORE flag set, this command instead
				    sets the guard page before the buffer to
				    be readable.

     MALLOC_VECTOR_SIZE 	    This option is the default alignment, as
				    of Mac OS X 10.5.  With this option, Guard
				    Malloc places allocations on 16 byte
				    boundaries, because vector instructions
				    (e.g., SSE or Altivec) require buffers to
				    be on 16 byte boundaries.  (The use of
				    vector instructions is becoming more com-
				    mon in some Mac OS X system libraries.)
				    MALLOC_VECTOR_SIZE is now the preferred
				    name of this environment variable; the
				    older MALLOC_ALTIVEC_SIZE is deprecated
				    but supported for backward compatibility.

     MALLOC_WORD_SIZE		    This flag specifies that Guard Malloc
				    should place allocations on word (4-byte)
				    boundaries, with the end of the buffer on
				    the last 4 bytes of the page.  This option
				    is useful because Carbon assumes that
				    pointers are word aligned, and without the
				    word alignment, any program relying on
				    Cocoa or Carbon would immediately crash.

     MALLOC_STRICT_SIZE 	    This flag specifies that Guard Malloc
				    should always align all allocations on
				    single-byte boundaries such that the last
				    byte of the buffer is at the end of the
				    page.  This will immediately catch even
				    one-byte buffer overruns, but applications
				    that use Carbon or Cocoa, or vector
				    instructions, may not run properly with
				    this option.

     MALLOC_PERMIT_INSANE_REQUESTS  GuardMalloc tries to protect against
				    requests for insane amounts of memory by
				    instructing the program to trap (if run-
				    ning under the debugger) if more than
				    100MB is requested.  If this environment
				    variable is set, then the check is dis-
				    abled.

     MALLOC_CHECK_HEADER	    This flag is enabled by default, which
				    causes Guard Malloc to check the validity
				    of a magic number in the malloc block
				    header when a block is freed or reallo-
				    cated.  To turn off this checking, set
				    this environment variable to NO or 0.

     MALLOC_NO_BACKTRACE	    By default when a block is allocated with
				    malloc() or realloc(), Guard Malloc
				    records twenty frames of the backtrace at
				    which the allocation occurred.  Set this
				    environment variable to disable that
				    recording of the backtraces.

     MallocStackLogging 	    If this flag is set, then standard system
				    malloc stack logging is enabled.  The
				    malloc_history(1) command can then be used
				    to show backtraces of all malloc and free
				    events made when using libgmalloc.	The
				    use of MallocStackLogging is independent
				    of the stack backtraces that libgmalloc
				    records with the allocated blocks them-
				    selves (see below), and which are con-
				    trolled by MALLOC_NO_BACKTRACE.

MEMORY VALUES USED BY GUARD MALLOC
     It's often useful to understand how Guard Malloc uses memory when debug-
     ging.  Guard Malloc writes strange byte sequences to catch certain prob-
     lems.  If the MALLOC_FILL_SPACE environment variable is set, newly allo-
     cated buffers will be filled with the value 0x55 in hopes of catching
     references to uninitialized memory.

     The space right before the buffer is dedicated to header information.
     The header is organized as:

     size of buffer + size of header (0x60 + requested size rounded to appro-
     priate boundary)
     thread id
     stack backtrace where allocation occurred (twenty frames; longer stack
     traces are truncated, and smaller stack traces will leave the unused
     frames zeroed.)
     magic number (0xdeadbeef)
     beginning of buffer

CAVEATS
     libgmalloc doesn't come without some weaknesses.  First, because each
     allocation requires two pages of virtual memory, only about 500,000 mal-
     loc allocations could conceivably exist before you run out of virtual
     memory.  The extravagant use of virtual memory will also cause much more
     swapping, so the program will run much slower than usual -- usually two
     orders of magnitude (100x).

     In addition, the extra pressure on the virtual memory system when running
     an application with Guard Malloc can cause top(1) to update its output
     more slowly.

     Don't forget -- if there's a memory bug in your program, the program will
     crash in Guard Malloc.  This is a feature!
