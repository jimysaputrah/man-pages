NAME
       glSampleCoverage - specify multisample coverage parameters

C SPECIFICATION
       void glSampleCoverage(GLclampf value, GLboolean invert);

PARAMETERS
       value
	   Specify a single floating-point sample coverage value. The value is
	   clamped to the range 0 1. The initial value is 1.0.

       invert
	   Specify a single boolean value representing if the coverage masks
	   should be inverted.	GL_TRUE and GL_FALSE are accepted. The initial
	   value is GL_FALSE.

DESCRIPTION
       Multisampling samples a pixel multiple times at various
       implementation-dependent subpixel locations to generate antialiasing
       effects. Multisampling transparently antialiases points, lines,
       polygons, and images if it is enabled.


       value is used in constructing a temporary mask used in determining
       which samples will be used in resolving the final fragment color. This
       mask is bitwise-anded with the coverage mask generated from the
       multisampling computation. If the invert flag is set, the temporary
       mask is inverted (all bits flipped) and then the bitwise-and is
       computed.

       If an implementation does not have any multisample buffers available,
       or multisampling is disabled, rasterization occurs with only a single
       sample computing a pixel's final RGB color.

       Provided an implementation supports multisample buffers, and
       multisampling is enabled, then a pixel's final color is generated by
       combining several samples per pixel. Each sample contains color, depth,
       and stencil information, allowing those operations to be performed on
       each sample.
