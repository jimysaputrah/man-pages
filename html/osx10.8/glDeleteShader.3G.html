NAME
       glDeleteShader - Deletes a shader object

C SPECIFICATION
       void glDeleteShader(GLuint shader);

PARAMETERS
       shader
	   Specifies the shader object to be deleted.

DESCRIPTION
       glDeleteShader frees the memory and invalidates the name associated
       with the shader object specified by shader. This command effectively
       undoes the effects of a call to glCreateShader().

       If a shader object to be deleted is attached to a program object, it
       will be flagged for deletion, but it will not be deleted until it is no
       longer attached to any program object, for any rendering context (i.e.,
       it must be detached from wherever it was attached before it will be
       deleted). A value of 0 for shader will be silently ignored.

       To determine whether an object has been flagged for deletion, call
       glGetShader() with arguments shader and GL_DELETE_STATUS.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if shader is not a value generated by
       OpenGL.

ASSOCIATED GETS
       glGetAttachedShaders() with the program object to be queried

       glGetShader() with arguments shader and GL_DELETE_STATUS

       glIsShader()
