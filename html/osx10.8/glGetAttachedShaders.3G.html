GLGETATTACHEDSHADERS(3G)	  OpenGL 3.3	      GLGETATTACHEDSHADERS(3G)



NAME
       glGetAttachedShaders - Returns the handles of the shader objects
       attached to a program object

C SPECIFICATION
       void glGetAttachedShaders(GLuint program, GLsizei maxCount,
				 GLsizei *count, GLuint *shaders);

PARAMETERS
       program
	   Specifies the program object to be queried.

       maxCount
	   Specifies the size of the array for storing the returned object
	   names.

       count
	   Returns the number of names actually returned in objects.

       shaders
	   Specifies an array that is used to return the names of attached
	   shader objects.

DESCRIPTION
       glGetAttachedShaders returns the names of the shader objects attached
       to program. The names of shader objects that are attached to program
       will be returned in shaders.  The actual number of shader names written
       into shaders is returned in count.  If no shader objects are attached
       to program, count is set to 0. The maximum number of shader names that
       may be returned in shaders is specified by maxCount.

       If the number of names actually returned is not required (for instance,
       if it has just been obtained by calling glGetProgram()), a value of
       NULL may be passed for count. If no shader objects are attached to
       program, a value of 0 will be returned in count. The actual number of
       attached shaders can be obtained by calling glGetProgram() with the
       value GL_ATTACHED_SHADERS.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if program is not a value generated by
       OpenGL.

       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if program is not a program object.

       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if maxCount is less than 0.

ASSOCIATED GETS
       glGetProgram() with argument GL_ATTACHED_SHADERS

       glIsProgram()
