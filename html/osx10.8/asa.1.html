NAME
     asa -- interpret carriage-control characters.

SYNOPSIS
     asa [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The asa utility reads files sequentially, mapping FORTRAN carriage-con-
     trol characters to line-printer control sequences, and writes them to the
     standard output.

     The first character of each line is interpreted as a carriage-control
     character.  The following characters are interpreted as follows:

     &ltspace&gt  Output the rest of the line without change.

     0	      Output a &ltnewline&gt character before printing the rest of the
	      line.

     1	      Output a &ltformfeed&gt character before printing the rest of the
	      line.

     +	      The trailing &ltnewline&gt of the previous line is replaced by a
	      &ltcarriage-return&gt before printing the rest of the line.

     Lines beginning with characters other than the above are treated as if
     they begin with &ltspace&gt.

EXAMPLES
     To view a file containing the output of a FORTRAN program:
	   asa file

     To format the output of a FORTRAN program and redirect it to a line-
     printer.
	   a.out | asa | lpr

DIAGNOSTICS
     The asa utility exit 0 on success, and &gt0 if an error occurs.

SEE ALSO

STANDARDS
     The asa utility conforms to IEEE Std 1003.2-1992 (``POSIX.2'').
