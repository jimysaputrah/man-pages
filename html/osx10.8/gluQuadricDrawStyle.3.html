NAME
       gluQuadricDrawStyle - specify the draw style desired for quadrics


C SPECIFICATION
       void gluQuadricDrawStyle( GLUquadric* quad,
				 GLenum draw )


PARAMETERS
       quad  Specifies the quadrics object (created with gluNewQuadric).

       draw  Specifies	the  desired  draw  style.  Valid values are GLU_FILL,
	     GLU_LINE, GLU_SILHOUETTE, and GLU_POINT.

DESCRIPTION
       gluQuadricDrawStyle specifies the draw style for quadrics rendered with
       quad. The legal values are as follows:

       GLU_FILL       Quadrics are rendered with polygon primitives. The poly-
		      gons  are  drawn	in  a  counterclockwise  fashion  with
		      respect	 to    their	normals   (as	defined   with
		      gluQuadricOrientation).

       GLU_LINE       Quadrics are rendered as a set of lines.

       GLU_SILHOUETTE Quadrics are rendered as a set  of  lines,  except  that
		      edges separating coplanar faces will not be drawn.

       GLU_POINT      Quadrics are rendered as a set of points.
