NAME
       Moose::Cookbook::Snack::Types - Snippets of code for using Types and
       Type Constraints

VERSION
       version 2.0205

SYNOPSIS
	 package Point;
	 use Moose;

	 has 'x' => ( isa => 'Int', is => 'ro' );
	 has 'y' => ( isa => 'Int', is => 'rw' );

	 package main;
	 use Try::Tiny;

	 my $point = try {
	     Point->new( x => 'fifty', y => 'forty' );
	 }
	 catch {
	     print "Oops: $_";
	 };

	 my $point;
	 my $xval	      = 'forty-two';
	 my $xattribute       = Point->meta->find_attribute_by_name('x');
	 my $xtype_constraint = $xattribute->type_constraint;

	 if ( $xtype_constraint->check($xval) ) {
	     $point = Point->new( x => $xval, y => 0 );
	 }
	 else {
	     print "Value: $xval is not an " . $xtype_constraint->name . "\n";
	 }

DESCRIPTION
       This is the Point example from Moose::Cookbook::Basics::Recipe1 with
       type checking added.

       If we try to assign a string value to an attribute that is an "Int",
       Moose will die with an explicit error message. The error will include
       the attribute name, as well as the type constraint name and the value
       which failed the constraint check.

       We use Try::Tiny to catch this error message.

       Later, we get the Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint object from a
       Moose::Meta::Attribute and use the Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint to check
       a value directly.
