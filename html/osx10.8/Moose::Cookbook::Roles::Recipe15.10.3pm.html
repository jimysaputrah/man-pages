DESCRIPTION
       Roles have two primary purposes: as interfaces, and as a means of code
       reuse. This recipe demonstrates the latter, with roles that define
       comparison and display code for objects.

       Let's start with "Eq". First, note that we've replaced "use Moose" with
       "use Moose::Role". We also have a new sugar function, "requires":

	 requires 'equal_to';

       This says that any class which consumes this role must provide an
       "equal_to" method. It can provide this method directly, or by consuming
       some other role.

       The "Eq" role defines its "not_equal_to" method in terms of the
       required "equal_to" method. This lets us minimize the methods that
       consuming classes must provide.

       The next role, "Comparable", builds on the "Eq" role. We include "Eq"
       in "Comparable" using "with", another new sugar function:

	 with 'Eq';

       The "with" function takes a list of roles to consume. In our example,
       the "Comparable" role provides the "equal_to" method required by "Eq".
       However, it could opt not to, in which case a class that consumed
       "Comparable" would have to provide its own "equal_to". In other words,
       a role can consume another role without providing any required methods.

       The "Comparable" role requires a method,  "compare":

	 requires 'compare';

       The "Comparable" role also provides a number of other methods, all of
       which ultimately rely on "compare".

	 sub equal_to {
	     my ( $self, $other ) = @_;
	     $self-&gtcompare($other) == 0;
	 }

	 sub greater_than {
	     my ( $self, $other ) = @_;
	     $self-&gtcompare($other) == 1;
	 }

	 sub less_than {
	     my ( $self, $other ) = @_;
	     $self-&gtcompare($other) == -1;
	 }

	 sub greater_than_or_equal_to {
	     my ( $self, $other ) = @_;
	     $self-&gtgreater_than($other) || $self-&gtequal_to($other);
	 }

	 sub less_than_or_equal_to {
	     my ( $self, $other ) = @_;
	     $self-&gtless_than($other) || $self-&gtequal_to($other);
	 }

       Finally, we define the "Printable" role. This role exists solely to
       provide an interface. It has no methods, just a list of required
       methods.  In this case, it just requires a "to_string" method.

       An interface role is useful because it defines both a method and a
       name. We know that any class which does this role has a "to_string"
       method, but we can also assume that this method has the semantics we
       want. Presumably, in real code we would define those semantics in the
       documentation for the "Printable" role. (1)

       Finally, we have the "US::Currency" class which consumes both the
       "Comparable" and "Printable" roles.

	 with 'Comparable', 'Printable';

       It also defines a regular Moose attribute, "amount":

	 has 'amount' =&gt ( is =&gt 'rw', isa =&gt 'Num', default =&gt 0 );

       Finally we see the implementation of the methods required by our roles.
       We have a "compare" method:

	 sub compare {
	     my ( $self, $other ) = @_;
	     $self-&gtamount &lt=&gt $other-&gtamount;
	 }

       By consuming the "Comparable" role and defining this method, we gain
       the following methods for free: "equal_to", "greater_than",
       "less_than", "greater_than_or_equal_to" and "less_than_or_equal_to".

       Then we have our "to_string" method:

	 sub to_string {
	     my $self = shift;
	     sprintf '$%0.2f USD' =&gt $self-&gtamount;
	 }

CONCLUSION
       Roles can be very powerful. They are a great way of encapsulating
       reusable behavior, as well as communicating (semantic and interface)
       information about the methods our classes provide.

FOOTNOTES
       (1) Consider two classes, "Runner" and "Process", both of which define
	   a "run" method. If we just require that an object implements a
	   "run" method, we still aren't saying anything about what that
	   method actually does. If we require an object that implements the
	   "Executable" role, we're saying something about semantics.
