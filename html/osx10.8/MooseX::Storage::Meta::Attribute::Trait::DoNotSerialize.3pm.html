NAME
       MooseX::Storage::Meta::Attribute::Trait::DoNotSerialize - A custom
       meta-attribute-trait to bypass serialization

SYNOPSIS
	 package Point;
	 use Moose;
	 use MooseX::Storage;

	 with Storage('format' => 'JSON', 'io' => 'File');

	 has 'x' => (is => 'rw', isa => 'Int');
	 has 'y' => (is => 'rw', isa => 'Int');

	 has 'foo' => (
	     traits => [ 'DoNotSerialize' ],
	     is     => 'rw',
	     isa    => 'CodeRef',
	 );

	 1;

DESCRIPTION
       Sometimes you don't want a particular attribute to be part of the
       serialization, in this case, you want to make sure that attribute uses
       this custom meta-attribute-trait. See the SYNOPSIS for a nice example
       that can be easily cargo-culted.

METHODS
