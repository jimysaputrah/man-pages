NAME
     raidutil -- Manage, manipulate, and view RAID objects.

SYNOPSIS
     raidutil [global options] verb direct-object arguments ...

DESCRIPTION
     raidutil utilizes the CoreRAID framework to manipulate RAID devices.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
     There are several global options that may be used with raidutil. These
     options are not specific to any particular verb. Instead they have a
     global effect upon the way that raidutil performs.  These global options
     are:

     -c &ltControllerType&gt | --controller &ltControllerType&gt
	      This option (controller) allows the user to specify a controller
	      type.

     -h | --help
	      This option (help) will print the standard "usage" text.

     -t | --terse
	      This option (terse) will minimize superfluous text.

     -v | --verbose
	      This option (verbose) will maximize the amount of detailed info-
	      mation the program will provide.

     -V | --version
	      This option (Version) will print out version information about
	      this program.

VERBS, DIRECT OBJECTS, AND SPECIFIC ARGUMENTS
     acknowledge event -n &ltEventNumber&gt
	      Marks an event as acknowledged by specifiying an identifying
	      event number.  The -n may also be expressed as --number.

     create raidset -n &ltNewRAIDSet&gt -d &ltListOfDriveBays&gt -r &ltRaidLevel&gt
	      Create a RAIDSet specifiying: a RAIDSet name; a list of drive
	      bays; the RAID level.  The -n, -d, and -r flags may also be
	      expressed as --name, --drives, and --raidlevel, respectively.
	      Valid raidlevel's are J+, 0, 1, 5, 0+1.

     create volume -n &ltNewVolumeName&gt -r &ltNameOfRAIDSet&gt -s &ltSizeOfVolume&gt
	      Create a volume specifiying: a volume name; a RAIDSet to build
	      the volume on; the size of the volume.  The -n, -d, and -s flags
	      may also be expressed as --name, --raidset, and --size, respec-
	      tively.

     delete raidset -n &ltNameOfRAIDSet&gt [-f] [-u]
	      Remove a RAIDSet.  The name of the RAIDSet is specified using
	      the -n argument.	The -n flag may also be expressed as --name.
	      The optional -f flag may also be expressed as --force.  The
	      optional -u flag may also be expressed as --unmount.

     delete volume -n &ltNameOfVolume&gt [-r &ltRAIDSet&gt] [-f] [-u]
	      Remove a volume.	The name of the volume is specified using the
	      -n argument.  The -n flag may also be expressed as --name.  The
	      optional -r flag may also be expressed as --raidset.  The
	      optional -f flag may also be expressed as --force.  The optional
	      -u flag may also be expressed as --unmount.

     list [devices]
	      List all known RAID devices.  This is the default behavior if no
	      direct object is specified.

     list status
	      Prints an overview of status information for the targeted RAID
	      device.

     list driveinfo
	      Lists relevant information about any disk drives associated with
	      the targeted RAID device.

     list eventinfo [-c n]
	      Lists the last 100 event messages.  When provided, the optional
	      'count' argument, will limit the output to the last 'n' event
	      messages (a value of 0 will display all event messsages).

     list raidsetinfo
	      Lists relevant information about any RAIDSet associated with the
	      targeted RAID device.

	      high.

EXAMPLES
     raidutil create raidset -n set2 -d 1,2 -r J+
	      This creates a RAIDSet named "set2", using the drives in bays
	      one and two, with a raid level of "Enhanced JBOD."

     raidutil create volume -n volume1 -r set1 -s 1.5T
	      This creates a volume named "volume1", on the RAIDSet named
	      "set1".  The size of the volume will be 1.5 tebibytes.

     raidutil modify volume -n volume1 --move -r set1 -t set2 --waitfortask
	      This moves the volume named "volume1", from the RAIDSet named
	      "set1".  to the  RAIDSet named "set2".  The program will wait
	      for the verification task to complete before proceeding.

     raidutil delete raidset -n setX
	      This deletes a RAIDSet named "setX." Any volumes associated with
	      this RAIDSet will also be destroyed.

     raidutil delete raidset -n setX --force
	      Regardless of whether there are any mounted file systems associ-
	      ated with this group, this command deletes a RAIDSet named
	      "setX." Any volumes associated with this group will also be
	      destroyed.

     raidutil delete volume -n myVolume
	      This deletes a volume named "myVolume."

     raidutil delete volume -n myVolume -r BigRAIDSet
	      This specifically deletes a volume named "myVolume," that exists
	      on the RAIDSet named BigRAIDSet.

     raidutil delete volume -n myVolume:BigRAIDSet
	      This specifically deletes a volume named "myVolume," that exists
	      on the group named BigRAIDSet.  Make note that this example uses
	      a method of overloading the volume name with the group name in
	      order to specify the group.

     raidutil list devices
	      This will print out a list of all known RAID devices.

     raidutil list version
	      This will print out version information for the RAID device.

COMPATIBILITY
   RAID Levels
     When creating a RAID set the user must specify the type of RAID set that
     they wish to create through the raidlevel argument.  Valid RAID levels
     are as follows:

	   J+	Enhanced JBOD

	   0	RAID 0 (striping)

	   1	RAID 1 (mirroring)

	   0+1 RAID 0+1 (mirroring a striped pair)

	   5	RAID 5 (striping with distributed parity)

     Using Enhanced JBOD, you can create a RAID set using a single drive. The
     resulting RAID set doesnOt gain the performance or data protection of the
     other RAID levels, but it does benefit from the data caching and battery
     backup provided by the RAID card. An enhanced JBOD set can also be
     migrated to other RAID sets or moved to another computer that has a Mac
     Pro or Xserve RAID Card installed.

     RAID 0 offers improved performance but no data protection. Blocks of data
     are spread across all of the drives in the RAID set in a process called
     striping. This allows better performance because file contents move in
     parallel to and from the individual drives in the set. RAID 0 also pro-
     vides the most usable disk space; nearly all space on all drives is
     available for user data. You can create a RAID 0 set using two, three, or
     four disks.

     RAID 1 protects data against a drive failure and allows some increase in
     read performance. Data is protected by duplicating the contents of each
     drive on a second drive in the set, a process called mirroring. Because
     of the duplication, a volume based on a RAID 1 canOt be larger than half
     of the total space available on the drives in the set. You can create a
     RAID 1 set using either two or four disks.

     RAID 0+1 combines the performance of RAID 0 with the data protection of
     RAID 1 by mirroring a striped set on a second pair of drives. Because
     mirroring duplicates all data, this level offers less usable disk space
     than RAID 5. Usable space is half of the total space available on the
     drives in the set. You need four disks to create a RAID 0+1 set.

     RAID 5 is a compromise between the performance of RAID 0 and the data
     protection of RAID 1. Performance is improved by striping data across the
     drives in the set. Data protection is provided by parity information that
     is distributed across the drives. Data can be recovered if any single
     drive fails. RAID 5 leaves you with more usable space than RAID 1. RAID 5
     needs only the equivalent of one driveOs worth of disk space to store the
     parity information. You can create a RAID 5 set using either three or
     four disks.

   Specifying volumes
     When performing certain actions, it may be desirable to explicitly spec-
     ify the group that a volume is built upon.  For example, when removing a
     volume, one might want to specify the associated group for clarity.  In
     these cases, an optional argument is generally available for this pur-
     pose.  An example of this is:

	   # raidutil delete volume -n myVolume -r theBigRAIDSet

     A shortcut exists whereby the RAIDSet may be specified as a suffix to the
     volume name.  For example, this is equivelent to the previous command:

	   # raidutil delete volume -n myVolume:theBigRAIDSet

     The RAIDSet name is simply added to the volume name using the colon char-
     acter as a separator.  This shortcut is supported by all of the "modify
     volume" actions.

   Specifying Sizes
     When specifying data that indicates a numeric size, the value will be
     assumed to be expressed in megabytes (MB) unless otherwise indicated.

     For our purposes, we will treat all size units as 1000 based numbers.

     Values may be expressed in bytes by ending the value with the letter "B".

     Other units for measure storage space follow suit, as shown by the fol-
     lowing table:

	   kilobyte (KB) 2^10 = 1000 bytes
	   megabyte (MB) 2^20 = 1000 * 1000 bytes
	   gigabyte (GB) 2^30 = 1000 * 1000 * 1000 bytes
	   terabyte (TB) 2^40 = 1000 * 1000 * 1000 * 1000 bytes
	   petabyte (PB) 2^50 = 1000 * 1000 * 1000 * 1000 * 1000 bytes

     For the purposes of entering size information to this program, the
     default units are mebibytes (MiB).  This program will support values
     expressed in the following units.	Acceptable abbreviations are listed
     after the name:

	   one byte = 1B	 ---  B
	   kilobyte = 1000B	 ---  K, KB
	   megabyte = 1000K	 ---  M, MB
	   gigabyte = 1000M	 ---  G, GB
	   terabyte = 1000G	 ---  T, TB
	   petabyte = 1000T	 ---  P, PB

     For example, each of the following commands will all create a volume
     named "theVolume" with a size of 600 megabytes, on the RAIDSet named
     "RAIDSet":

	   # raidutil create volume -n theVolume -s 600000K -r RAIDSet-A

	   # raidutil create volume -n theVolume -s 600 -r RAIDSet

	   # raidutil create volume -n theVolume -s 600M -r RAIDSet

	   # raidutil create volume -n theVolume -s 0.6GB -r RAIDSet

	   # raidutil create volume -n theVolume -s 0.0006TB -r RAIDSet

	   # raidutil create volume -n theVolume -s 0.0000006P -r RAIDSet

   Special Size Values For Creating Volumes
     In place of a numeric value, the user may provide the word all.  When
     this is done the program will attempt to use the maximum valid value.
     For example, the following command would create a	volume named
     "BigVolume", on the RAIDSet named "BigRAIDSet", using all available space
     on that RAIDSet:

	   # raidutil create volume -n BigVolume -s all -r BigRAIDSet

     Similarly, the user may provide a value that indicates a percentage of
     available space.  This is done by providing a numeric value between 1 and
     100 that is followed by the `%' character.  For example, the following
     command would create a  volume named "BigVolume", on the RAIDSet named
     "BigRAIDSet", using all available space on that RAIDSet:

	   # raidutil create volume -n BigVolume -s 100% -r BigRAIDSet

     The following command would create a  volume named "MyVolume", on the
     RAIDSet named "MyRAIDSet", using one fifth of all available space on that
     RAIDSet:

	   # raidutil create volume -n MyVolume -s 20% -r MyRAIDSet

     It should be noted that, all percentage values are rounded down to the
     nearest whole number.  Thus, 33.333% becomes 33%, and 17.9321% becomes
     17%.  Computed values are based on the RAIDSet available capacity
     attribute.

     NOTE:  The use of mebibyte and related units is strongly endorsed by IEC,
     IEEE and CIPM.  The mebibyte and related units are defined in the IEC
     document IEC 60027-1.

EXIT STATUS
     The raidutil utility exits 0 on success, and &gt0 if an error occurs.
