NAME
       ldap_rename, ldap_rename_s - Renames the specified entry.

LIBRARY
       OpenLDAP LDAP (libldap, -lldap)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <ldap.h>

       int ldap_rename( ld, dn, newrdn, newparent, deleteoldrdn, sctrls[], cctrls[], msgidp );
       LDAP *ld;
       const char *dn, *newrdn, *newparent;
       int deleteoldrdn;
       LDAPControl *sctrls[], *cctrls[];
       int *msgidp);

       int ldap_rename_s( ld, dn, newrdn, newparent, deleteoldrdn, sctrls[], cctrls[] );
       LDAP *ld;
       const char *dn, *newrdn, *newparent;
       int deleteoldrdn;
       LDAPControl *sctrls[], *cctrls[];

DESCRIPTION
       These  routines are used to perform a LDAP rename operation.  The func-
       tion changes the leaf component of an entry's  distinguished  name  and
       optionally moves the entry to a new parent container. The ldap_rename_s
       performs a rename operation synchronously.  The method takes dn,  which
       points  to the distinguished name of the entry whose attribute is being
       compared, newparent,the distinguished name of the entry's  new  parent.
       If  this  parameter  is	NULL, only the RDN is changed.	The root DN is
       specified by passing a zero length string, "".  deleteoldrdn  specifies
       whether the old RDN should be retained or deleted.  Zero indicates that
       the old RDN  should  be	retained.  If  you  choose  this  option,  the
       attribute  will	contain  both  names  (the old and the new).  Non-zero
       indicates that the old RDN should be deleted.  serverctrls points to an
       array  of  LDAPControl  structures that list the client controls to use
       with this extended operation. Use NULL to specify no  client  controls.
       clientctrls  points to an array of LDAPControl structures that list the
       client controls to use with the search.

       ldap_rename works just like ldap_rename_s, but the operation  is  asyn-
       chronous.  It  returns  the message id of the request it initiated. The
       result of this operation can be obtained by calling ldap_result(3).

ERRORS
       ldap_rename() returns -1 in case of error initiating the  request,  and
       will  set the ld_errno field in the ld parameter to indicate the error.
       ldap_rename_s() returns the LDAP error code resulting from  the	rename
       operation.
