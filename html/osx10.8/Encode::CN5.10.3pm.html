NAME
       Encode::CN - China-based Chinese Encodings

SYNOPSIS
	   use Encode qw/encode decode/;
	   $euc_cn = encode("euc-cn", $utf8);	# loads Encode::CN implicitly
	   $utf8   = decode("euc-cn", $euc_cn); # ditto

DESCRIPTION
       This module implements China-based Chinese charset encodings.
       Encodings supported are as follows.

	 Canonical   Alias	       Description
	 --------------------------------------------------------------------
	 euc-cn      /\beuc.*cn$/i     EUC (Extended Unix Character)
		 /\bcn.*euc$/i
		     /\bGB[-_ ]?2312(?:\D.*$|$)/i (see below)
	 gb2312-raw		       The raw (low-bit) GB2312 character map
	 gb12345-raw		       Traditional chinese counterpart to
		       GB2312 (raw)
	 iso-ir-165		       GB2312 + GB6345 + GB8565 + additions
	 MacChineseSimp 	       GB2312 + Apple Additions
	 cp936			       Code Page 936, also known as GBK
		       (Extended GuoBiao)
	 hz			       7-bit escaped GB2312 encoding
	 --------------------------------------------------------------------

       To find how to use this module in detail, see Encode.

NOTES
       Due to size concerns, "GB 18030" (an extension to "GBK") is distributed
       separately on CPAN, under the name Encode::HanExtra. That module also
       contains extra Taiwan-based encodings.

BUGS
       When you see "charset=gb2312" on mails and web pages, they really mean
       "euc-cn" encodings.  To fix that, "gb2312" is aliased to "euc-cn".  Use
       "gb2312-raw" when you really mean it.

       The ASCII region (0x00-0x7f) is preserved for all encodings, even
       though this conflicts with mappings by the Unicode Consortium.  See

       &lthttp://www.debian.or.jp/~kubota/unicode-symbols.html.en&gt

       to find out why it is implemented that way.
