NAME
       Class::MOP::Method - Method Meta Object

VERSION
       version 2.0205

DESCRIPTION
       The Method Protocol is very small, since methods in Perl 5 are just
       subroutines in a specific package. We provide a very basic
       introspection interface.

METHODS
       Class::MOP::Method->wrap($code, %options)
	   This is the constructor. It accepts a method body in the form of
	   either a code reference or a Class::MOP::Method instance, followed
	   by a hash of options.

	   The options are:

	   o	   name

		   The method name (without a package name). This is required
		   if $code is a coderef.

	   o	   package_name

		   The package name for the method. This is required if $code
		   is a coderef.

	   o	   associated_metaclass

		   An optional Class::MOP::Class object. This is the metaclass
		   for the method's class.

       $metamethod->clone(%params)
	   This makes a shallow clone of the method object. In particular,
	   subroutine reference itself is shared between all clones of a given
	   method.

	   When a method is cloned, the original method object will be
	   available by calling "original_method" on the clone.

       $metamethod->body
	   This returns a reference to the method's subroutine.

       $metamethod->name
	   This returns the method's name

       $metamethod->package_name
	   This returns the method's package name.

       $metamethod->fully_qualified_name
	   This returns the method's fully qualified name (package name and
	   method name).

       $metamethod->associated_metaclass
	   This returns the Class::MOP::Class object for the method, if one
	   exists.

       $metamethod->original_method
	   If this method object was created as a clone of some other method
	   object, this returns the object that was cloned.

       $metamethod->original_name
	   This returns the method's original name, wherever it was first
	   defined.

	   If this method is a clone of a clone (of a clone, etc.), this
	   method returns the name from the first method in the chain of
	   clones.

       $metamethod->original_package_name
	   This returns the method's original package name, wherever it was
	   first defined.

	   If this method is a clone of a clone (of a clone, etc.), this
	   method returns the package name from the first method in the chain
	   of clones.

       $metamethod->original_fully_qualified_name
	   This returns the method's original fully qualified name, wherever
	   it was first defined.

	   If this method is a clone of a clone (of a clone, etc.), this
	   method returns the fully qualified name from the first method in
	   the chain of clones.

       $metamethod->attach_to_class($metaclass)
	   Given a Class::MOP::Class object, this method sets the associated
	   metaclass for the method. This will overwrite any existing
	   associated metaclass.

       $metamethod->detach_from_class
	   Removes any associated metaclass object for the method.

       $metamethod->execute(...)
	   This executes the method. Any arguments provided will be passed on
	   to the method itself.

       Class::MOP::Method->meta
	   This will return a Class::MOP::Class instance for this class.

	   It should also be noted that Class::MOP will actually bootstrap
	   this module by installing a number of attribute meta-objects into
	   its metaclass.
