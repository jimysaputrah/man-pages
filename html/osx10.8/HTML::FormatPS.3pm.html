NAME
       HTML::FormatPS - Format HTML as PostScript

VERSION
       version 2.10

SYNOPSIS
	   use HTML::TreeBuilder;
	   $tree = HTML::TreeBuilder-&gtnew-&gtparse_file("test.html");

	   use HTML::FormatPS;
	   $formatter = HTML::FormatPS-&gtnew(
	       FontFamily =&gt 'Helvetica',
	       PaperSize  =&gt 'Letter',
	   );
	   print $formatter-&gtformat($tree);

       Or, for short:

	   use HTML::FormatPS;
	   print HTML::FormatPS-&gtformat_file(
	       "test.html",
	       'FontFamily' =&gt 'Helvetica',
	       'PaperSize'  =&gt 'Letter',
	   );

DESCRIPTION
       The HTML::FormatPS is a formatter that outputs PostScript code.
       Formatting of HTML tables and forms is not implemented.

       HTML::FormatPS is built on top of HTML::Formatter and so further detail
       may be found in the documentation for HTML::Formatter.

       You might specify the following parameters when constructing the
       formatter object (or when calling format_file or format_string):

       PaperSize
	   What kind of paper should we format for.  The value can be one of
	   these: A3, A4, A5, B4, B5, Letter, Legal, Executive, Tabloid,
	   Statement, Folio, 10x14, Quarto.

	   The default is "A4".

       PaperWidth
	   The width of the paper, in points.  Setting PaperSize also defines
	   this value.

       PaperHeight
	   The height of the paper, in points.	Setting PaperSize also defines
	   this value.

       LeftMargin
	   The left margin, in points.

       RightMargin
	   The right margin, in points.

       HorizontalMargin
	   Both left and right margin at the same time.  The default value is
	   4 cm.

       TopMargin
	   The top margin, in points.

       BottomMargin
	   The bottom margin, in points.

       VerticalMargin
	   Both top and bottom margin at the same time.  The default value is
	   2 cm,

       PageNo
	   This parameter determines if we should put page numbers on the
	   pages.  The default value is true; so you have to set this value to
	   0 in order to suppress page numbers.  (The "No" in "PageNo" means
	   number/numero!)

       FontFamily
	   This parameter specifies which family of fonts to use for the
	   formatting.	Legal values are "Courier", "Helvetica" and "Times".
	   The default is "Times".

       FontScale
	   This is a scaling factor for all the font sizes.  The default value
	   is 1.

	   For example, if you want everything to be almost three times as
	   large, you could set this to 2.7.  If you wanted things just a bit
	   smaller than normal, you could set it to .92.

       Leading
	   This option (pronounced "ledding", not "leeding") controls how much
	   is space between lines. This is a factor of the font size used for
	   that line.  Default is 0.1 -- so between two 12-point lines, there
	   will be 1.2 points of space.

       StartPage
	   Assuming you have PageNo on, StartPage controls what the page
	   number of the first page will be. By default, it is 1. So if you
	   set this to 87, the first page would say "87" on it, the next "88",
	   and so on.

       NoProlog
	   If this option is set to a true value, HTML::FormatPS will make a
	   point of not emitting the PostScript prolog before the document. By
	   default, this is off, meaning that HTML::FormatPS will emit the
	   prolog. This option is of interest only to advanced users.

       NoTrailer
	   If this option is set to a true value, HTML::FormatPS will make a
	   point of not emitting the PostScript trailer at the end of the
	   document. By default, this is off, meaning that HTML::FormatPS will
	   emit the bit of PostScript that ends the document. This option is
	   of interest only to advanced users.

METHODS
   new
	   my $formatter = FormatterClass-&gtnew(
	       option1 =&gt value1, option2 =&gt value2, ...
	   );

       This creates a new formatter object with the given options.

ISSUES
       o   Output is in ISO Latin1 format. The underlying HTML parsers tend to
	   now work in Unicode (perl native) code points. There is an
	   impedance mismatch between these, which may give issues with
	   complex characters within HTML.

TO DO
       o   Support for some more character styles, notably including: strike-
	   through, underlining, superscript, and subscript.

       o   Support for Unicode.

       o   Support for Win-1252 encoding, since that's what most people mean
	   when they use characters in the range 0x80-0x9F in HTML.

       o   And, if it's ever even reasonably possible, support for tables.

       I would welcome email from people who can help me out or advise me on
       the above.
