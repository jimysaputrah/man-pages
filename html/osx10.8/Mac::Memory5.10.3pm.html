NAME
       Mac::Memory - MacOS Memory Manager

       Provide the MacPerl interface to the memory management routines in the
       MacOS.

       Access to Inside Macintosh is essential for proper use of these
       functions.  Explanations of terms, processes and procedures are
       provided there.	Any attempt to use these functions without guidance
       can cause severe errors in your machine, including corruption of data.
       You have been warned.

SYNOPSIS
       The Memory module defines Ptr and Handle classes, and function
       interfaces to the memory management.

	   use Mac::Memory;
	   $handle = new Handle;
	   $handle2 = NewHandle;

DESCRIPTION
       The following packages and functions provide low level access to the
       memory management functions.

   Handle
       Handle provides an object interface to do simple operations on MacOS
       handles.  The interface is simpler than the more general memory
       management functions.

       new
       new STRING
	   Create a new handle and return it. Copy $STRING into the handle if
	   present.  Return a 0 value if a handle could not be created.

	       $h = new Handle;
	       $hs = new Handle("This string will now exist in hyperspace");

       size
	   Return the size of a handle (i.e., its data portion).

	       die unless (new Handle)-&gtsize == 0;
	       die unless $hs-&gtsize == 40;

       append DATA
	   Appends the DATA to the end of the handle and returns the success
	   as the result.

	       $h-&gtappend("This string will now exist in hyperspace");
	       die unless $h-&gtsize == 40;

       set OFFSET, LENGTH, DATA
       set OFFSET, LENGTH
       set OFFSET
       set Munge the contents of the handle with the $DATA (deleting if not
	   present), for the $LENGTH (through to the end of the handle
	   contents if not present), starting at $OFFSET (the beginning if not
	   present).

	       $h-&gtset(5, 6, "datum");

	   yields

	       "This datum will now exist in hyperspace"

       get OFFSET, LENGTH
       get OFFSET
       get Return a datum which is the contents of the memory referenced by
	   $HANDLE, starting at $OFFSET (default zero), of length $LENGTH
	   (default the rest of the handle).

	       die unless $hs-&gtget(5, 6) eq "string";

       address
	   Return the address of the memory block.

       state
       state NEWSTATE
	   Return the (locked) state of the handle, or return TRUE if the
	   $NEWSTATE of the handle is installed.

	       my $state = $h-&gtstate;
	       HLock($h);
	       # bunch of operations requiring $h to be locked
	       $h-&gtstate($state);  # so nested locks exit properly

	   More than the lock state is stored here, so restoring the actual
	   state on leaving a scope is required.

       open MODE
	   Open a stream to a handle and return it.

	   NOT DEFINED AT THE MOMENT

	   SysRet _open(hand, mode)	 Handle    hand      int       mode
		CODE:	   RETVAL = OpenHandle(hand, mode);	 OUTPUT:
		RETVAL

       dispose
	   Disposes of the handle.  Return zero if no error was detected.

       Almost all of the memory management needs in MacPerl can be handled by
       the above interface

   Ptr
       Ptr provides an object interface to do simple operations on MacOS
       pointers (nonrelocatable heap blocks). There are very few good reasons
       to create pointers like this.

       size
	   Return the size of a pointer (i.e., its data portion).

	       die unless $ptr-&gtsize == 40;

       set OFFSET, DATA
       get OFFSET, LENGTH
       get OFFSET
       get Return a datum which is the contents of the memory referenced by
	   PTR, starting at $OFFSET (default zero), of length $LENGTH (default
	   the rest of the block).

	       die unless $ps-&gtget(5, 6) eq "string";

       address
	   Return the address of the memory block.

       dispose
	   Disposes of the block.  Return zero if no error was detected.

   Functions
       GetApplLimit
	   Mac OS only.

	   The GetApplLimit function returns the current application heap
	   limit.

       TopMem
	   Return a pointer to the top of memory for the application.

       NewHandle BYTECOUNT
       NewHandleSys BYTECOUNT
       NewHandleClear BYTECOUNT
       NewHandleSysClear BYTECOUNT
	   Mac OS only. (NewHandleSys, NewHandleSysClear)

	   Return a handle of $BYTECOUNT size.

	   NewHandleSys returns a handle in the system heap.

	   The NewHandleClear and NewHandleSysClear functions work much as the
	   NewHandle and NewHandleSys functions do but set all bytes in the
	   new block to 0 instead of leaving the contents of the block
	   undefined.  Currently, this is quite inefficient.

       NewPtr BYTECOUNT
       NewPtrSys BYTECOUNT
	   Mac OS only.

       NewPtrClear BYTECOUNT
       NewPtrSysClear BYTECOUNT
	   Mac OS only. (NewPtrSys, NewPtrSysClear)

	   Allocate a nonrelocatable block of memory of a specified size.

	   NewPtrSys and NewPtrSysClear allocate blocks in the system heap.

	   NewPtrClear and NewPtrSysClear allocate and zero the blocks
	   (inefficiently).

       MaxBlock
       MaxBlockSys
	   Mac OS only. (MaxBlockSys)

	   The MaxBlock function returns the maximum contiguous space, in
	   bytes, that you could obtain after compacting the current heap
	   zone. MaxBlock does not actually do the compaction.

	   MaxBlockSys does the same for the system heap.

       StackSpace
	   The StackSpace function returns the current amount of stack space
	   (in bytes) between the current stack pointer and the application
	   heap at the instant of return from the trap.

       NewEmptyHandle
       NewEmptyHandleSys
	   Mac OS only. (NewEmptyHandleSys)

	   The NewEmptyHandle function initializes a new handle by allocating
	   a master pointer for it, but it does not allocate any memory for
	   the handle to control.  NewEmptyHandle sets the handle's master
	   pointer to NIL.

	   NewEmptyHandleSys does the same for the system heap.

       HLock HANDLE
	   Lock a relocatable block so that it does not move in the heap. If
	   you plan to dereference a handle and then allocate, move, or purge
	   memory (or call a routine that does so), then you should lock the
	   handle before using the dereferenced handle.

       HUnlock HANDLE
	   Unlock a relocatable block so that it is free to move in its heap
	   zone.

       HPurge HANDLE
	   Mark a relocatable block so that it can be purged if a memory
	   request cannot be fulfilled after compaction.

       HNoPurge HANDLE
	   Mark a relocatable block so that it cannot be purged.

       HLockHi HANDLE
	   The HLockHi procedure attempts to move the relocatable block
	   referenced by the handle $HANDLE upward until it reaches a
	   nonrelocatable block, a locked relocatable block, or the top of the
	   heap. Then HLockHi locks the block.

       TempNewHandle BYTECOUNT
	   The TempNewHandle function returns a handle to a block of size
	   $BYTECOUNT from temporary memory. If it cannot allocate a block of
	   that size, the function returns NIL.

       TempMaxMem
	   The TempMaxMem function compacts the current heap zone and returns
	   the size of the largest contiguous block available for temporary
	   allocation.

	       $SIZE = &TempMaxMem;

       TempFreeMem
	   The TempFreeMem function returns the total amount of free temporary
	   memory that you could allocate by calling TempNewHandle. The
	   returned value is the total number of free bytes. Because these
	   bytes might be dispersed throughout memory, it is ordinarily not
	   possible to allocate a single relocatable block of that size.

	       $SIZE = &TempFreeMem;

       CompactMem BYTECOUNT
       CompactMemSys BYTECOUNT
	   Mac OS only. (CompactMemSys)

	   The CompactMem function compacts the current heap zone by moving
	   unlocked, relocatable blocks down until they encounter
	   nonrelocatable blocks or locked, relocatable blocks, but not by
	   purging blocks. It continues compacting until it either finds a
	   contiguous block of at least $BYTECOUNT free bytes or has compacted
	   the entire zone.

	   The CompactMem function returns the size, in bytes, of the largest
	   contiguous free block for which it could make room, but it does not
	   actually allocate that block.

	   CompactMemSys does the same for the system heap.

       PurgeMem BYTECOUNT
       PurgeMemSys BYTECOUNT
	   Mac OS only. (PurgeMemSys)

	   The PurgeMem procedure sequentially purges blocks from the current
	   heap zone until it either allocates a contiguous block of at least
	   $BYTECOUNT free bytes or has purged the entire zone. If it purges
	   the entire zone without creating a contiguous block of at least
	   $BYTECOUNT free bytes, PurgeMem generates a memFullErr.

	   The PurgeMem procedure purges only relocatable, unlocked, purgeable
	   blocks.

	   The PurgeMem procedure does not actually attempt to allocate a
	   block of  $BYTECOUNT bytes.

	   PurgeMemSys does the same for the system heap.

       FreeMem
       FreeMemSys
	   Mac OS only. (FreeMemSys)

	   The FreeMem function returns the total amount of free space (in
	   bytes) in the current heap zone. Note that it usually isn't
	   possible to allocate a block of that size, because of heap
	   fragmentation due to nonrelocatable or locked blocks.

	   FreeMemSys does the same for the system heap.

       ReserveMem BYTECOUNT
       ReserveMemSys BYTECOUNT
	   Mac OS only. (ReserveMemSys)

	   The ReserveMem procedure attempts to create free space for a block
	   of $BYTECOUNT contiguous logical bytes at the lowest possible
	   position in the current heap zone. It pursues every available means
	   of placing the block as close as possible to the bottom of the
	   zone, including moving other relocatable blocks upward, expanding
	   the zone (if possible), and purging blocks from it.

	   ReserveMemSys does the same for the system heap.

       MaxMem
       MaxMemSys
	   Mac OS only. (MaxMemSys)

	   Use the MaxMem function to compact and purge the current heap zone.
	   The values returned are the amount of memory available and the
	   amount by which the zone can grow.

	       ($SIZE, $GROW) = &MaxMem;

	   MaxMemSys does the purge and compact of the system heap zone, and
	   the $GROW value is set to zero.

       MoveHHi HANDLE
	   The MoveHHi procedure attempts to move the relocatable block
	   referenced by the handle $HANDLE upward until it reaches a
	   nonrelocatable block, a locked relocatable block, or the top of the
	   heap.

       DisposePtr PTR
	   Releases the memory occupied by the nonrelocatable block specified
	   by $PTR.

       GetPtrSize PTR
	   The GetPtrSize function returns the logical size, in bytes, of the
	   nonrelocatable block pointed to by $PTR.

       SetPtrSize PTR, NEWSIZE
	   The SetPtrSize procedure attempts to change the logical size of the
	   nonrelocatable block pointed to by $PTR. The new logical size is
	   specified by $NEWSIZE.  Return zero if no error was detected.

       DisposeHandle HANDLE
	   The DisposeHandle procedure releases the memory occupied by the
	   relocatable block whose handle is $HANDLE. It also frees the
	   handle's master pointer for other uses.

       SetHandleSize HANDLE, BYTECOUNT
	   The SetHandleSize procedure attempts to change the logical size of
	   the relocatable block whose handle is $HANDLE. The new logical size
	   is specified by $BYTECOUNT.	Return zero if no error was detected.

       GetHandleSize HANDLE
	   The GetHandleSize function returns the logical size, in bytes, of
	   the relocatable block whose handle is $HANDLE. In case of an error,
	   GetHandleSize returns 0.

       ReallocateHandle HANDLE, BYTECOUNT
	   Allocates a new relocatable block with a logical size of $BYTECOUNT
	   bytes. It updates the handle $HANDLE by setting its master pointer
	   to point to the new block.  The new block is unlocked and
	   unpurgeable.  Return zero if no error was detected.

       EmptyHandle
	   Free memory taken by a relocatable block without freeing the
	   relocatable block's master pointer for other uses.

       MoreMasters
	   Call the MoreMasters procedure several times at the beginning of
	   your program to prevent the Memory Manager from running out of
	   master pointers in the middle of application execution. If it does
	   run out, it allocates more, possibly causing heap fragmentation.

       BlockMove SOURCEPTR, DESTPTR, BYTECOUNT
       BlockMoveData SOURCEPTR, DESTPTR, BYTECOUNT
	   The BlockMove/BlockMoveData procedure moves a block of $BYTECOUNT
	   consecutive bytes from the address designated by $SOURCEPTR to that
	   designated by $DESTPTR.

       PurgeSpace
	   Determine the total amount of free memory and the size of the
	   largest allocatable block after a purge of the heap.

	       ($Total, $Contiguous) = &PurgeSpace;

       HGetState HANDLE
	   Get the current properties of a relocatable block (perhaps so that
	   you can change and then later restore those properties).

       HSetState HANDLE, STATE
	   Restore properties of a block after a call to HGetState.

       HandToHand HANDLE
	   The HandToHand function attempts to copy the information in the
	   relocatable block to which $HANDLE is a handle.  Return "undef" if
	   an error was detected.

       PtrToHand PTR, BYTECOUNT
	   The PtrToHand function returns a newly created handle to a copy of
	   the number of bytes specified by $BYTECOUNT, beginning at the
	   location specified by $PTR.	Return "undef" if an error was
	   detected.

       PtrToXHand HANDLE, PTR, BYTECOUNT
	   The PtrToXHand function makes the existing handle, specified by
	   $HANDLE, a handle to a copy of the number of bytes specified by
	   $BYTECOUNT, beginning at the location specified by $PTR.  Return
	   "undef" if an error was detected.

       HandAndHand AHNDLE, BHNDLE
	   The HandAndHand function concatenates the information from the
	   relocatable block to which $AHNDL is a handle onto the end of the
	   relocatable block to which $BHNDL is a handle. The $AHNDL variable
	   remains unchanged.  Return zero if no error was detected.

       PtrAndHand PTR, HANDLE, BYTECOUNT
	   The PtrAndHand function takes the number of bytes specified by
	   $BYTECOUNT, beginning at the location specified by $PTR, and
	   concatenates them onto the end of the relocatable block to which
	   $HANDLE is a handle.

       The low level interface is not likely to be needed, except for the
       HLock() function.
