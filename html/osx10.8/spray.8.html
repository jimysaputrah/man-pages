SPRAY(8)		  BSD System Manager's Manual		      SPRAY(8)

NAME
     spray -- send many packets to host

SYNOPSIS
     spray [-c count] [-d delay] [-l length] host ...

DESCRIPTION
     Spray sends multiple RPC packets to host and records how many of them
     were correctly received and how long it took.

     The options are as follows:

     -c count
	     Send count packets.

     -d delay
	     Pause delay microseconds between sending each packet.

     -l length
	     Set the length of the packet that holds the RPC call message to
	     length bytes.  Not all values of length are possible because RPC
	     data is encoded using XDR.  Spray rounds up to the nearest possi-
	     ble value.

     Spray is intended for use in network testing, measurement, and manage-
     ment.  This command can be very hard on a network and should be used with
     caution.
