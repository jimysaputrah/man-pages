NAME
       glBlendEquation - set the blend equation


C SPECIFICATION
       void glBlendEquation( GLenum mode )


PARAMETERS
       mode  specifies	how  source  and  destination colors are combined.  It
	     must be GL_FUNC_ADD, GL_FUNC_SUBTRACT,  GL_FUNC_REVERSE_SUBTRACT,
	     GL_MIN, GL_MAX.


DESCRIPTION
       The blend equation determines how a new pixel (the ``source'' color) is
       combined with a pixel already in the framebuffer  (the  ``destination''
       color).

       GL_MIN sets  the  blend	equation  so that each component of the result
	      color is the minimum of  the  corresponding  components  of  the
	      source and destination colors.

       GL_MAX sets  the  blend	equation  so that each component of the result
	      color is the maximum of  the  corresponding  components  of  the
	      source and destination colors.

       The remaining blend equations use the source and destination blend fac-
       tors specified by glBlendFunc.  See glBlendFunc for  a  description  of
       the various blend factors.

       In  the	equations that follow, source and destination color components
       are referred to as (Rs, Gs, Bs, As ) and (Rd, Gd,  Bd,  Ad  ),  respec-
       tively.	 The  result  color  is referred to as (Rr, Gr, Br, Ar ).  The
       source and destination blend factors are denoted (sR, sG, sB, sA )  and
       (dR,  dG, dB, dA ), respectively.  For these equations all color compo-
       nents are understood to have values in the range [0, 1].

       GL_FUNC_ADD
	      sets the blend equation so that the source and destination  data
	      are  added.  Each component of the source color is multiplied by
	      the corresponding source factor, then each component of the des-
	      tination	color  is  multiplied by the corresponding destination
	      factor.  The result is the componentwise sum of  the  two  prod-
	      ucts, clamped to the range [0, 1].


		     Rr = min (1, Rs sR + Rd dR )
		     Gr = min (1, Gs sG + Gd dG )
		     Br = min (1, Bs sB + Bd dB )
		     Ar = min (1, As sA + Ad dA )

       GL_FUNC_SUBTRACT
	      Is like GL_FUNC_ADD except the product of the destination factor
	      and the destination color is componentwise subtracted  from  the
	      product  of  the source factor and the source color.  The result
	      is clamped to the range [0, 1].

		     Rr = max (0 , Rs sR - Rd dR )
		     Gr = max (0 , Gs sG - Gd dG )
		     Br = max (0 , Bs sB - Bd dB )
		     Ar = max (0 , As sA - Ad dA )

       GL_FUNC_REVERSE_SUBTRACT
	      Is like GL_FUNC_ADD except the product of the source factor  and
	      the source color is componentwise subtracted from the product of
	      the destination factor and the destination color.  The result is
	      clamped to the range [0, 1].

		     Rr = max (0 , Rd dR - Rs sR )
		     Gr = max (0 , Gd dG - Gs sG )
		     Br = max (0 , Bd dB - Bs sB )
		     Ar = max (0 , Ad dA - As sA )

       The  GL_MIN  and GL_MAX equations are useful for applications that ana-
       lyze
       image data (image thresholding against a constant color, for  example).
       The  GL_FUNC_ADD  equation is useful for antialiasing and transparency,
       among other things.

       Initially, the blend equation is set to GL_FUNC_ADD.


NOTES
       glBlendEquation is part of the GL_ARB_imaging  subset.  glBlendEquation
       is  present  only  if  GL_ARB_imaging  is  returned when glGetString is
       called with GL_EXTENSIONS as its argument.

       The GL_MIN, and GL_MAX equations do not use the source  or  destination
       factors, only the source and destination colors.


ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_ENUM	is  generated  if  mode  is  not  one  of GL_FUNC_ADD,
       GL_FUNC_SUBTRACT, GL_FUNC_REVERSE_SUBTRACT, GL_MAX, or GL_MIN.

       GL_INVALID_OPERATION  is  generated  if	glBlendEquation  is   executed
       between	the  execution	of  glBegin and the corresponding execution of
       glEnd.

ASSOCIATED GETS
       glGet with an argument of GL_BLEND_EQUATION
