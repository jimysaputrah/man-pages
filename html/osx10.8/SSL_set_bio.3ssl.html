NAME
       SSL_set_bio - connect the SSL object with a BIO

SYNOPSIS
	#include <openssl/ssl.h>

	void SSL_set_bio(SSL *ssl, BIO *rbio, BIO *wbio);

DESCRIPTION
       SSL_set_bio() connects the BIOs rbio and wbio for the read and write
       operations of the TLS/SSL (encrypted) side of ssl.

       The SSL engine inherits the behaviour of rbio and wbio, respectively.
       If a BIO is non-blocking, the ssl will also have non-blocking
       behaviour.

       If there was already a BIO connected to ssl, BIO_free() will be called
       (for both the reading and writing side, if different).

RETURN VALUES
       SSL_set_bio() cannot fail.
