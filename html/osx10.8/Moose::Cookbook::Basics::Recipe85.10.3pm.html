NAME
       Moose::Cookbook::Basics::Recipe8 - Builder methods and lazy_build

SYNOPSIS
	 package BinaryTree;
	 use Moose;

	 has 'node' =&gt (is =&gt 'rw', isa =&gt 'Any');

	 has 'parent' =&gt (
	     is        =&gt 'rw',
	     isa       =&gt 'BinaryTree',
	     predicate =&gt 'has_parent',
	     weak_ref  =&gt 1,
	 );

	 has 'left' =&gt (
	     is        =&gt 'rw',
	     isa       =&gt 'BinaryTree',
	     predicate =&gt 'has_left',
	     lazy      =&gt 1,
	     builder   =&gt '_build_child_tree',
	 );

	 has 'right' =&gt (
	     is        =&gt 'rw',
	     isa       =&gt 'BinaryTree',
	     predicate =&gt 'has_right',
	     lazy      =&gt 1,
	     builder   =&gt '_build_child_tree',
	 );

	 before 'right', 'left' =&gt sub {
	     my ($self, $tree) = @_;
	     $tree-&gtparent($self) if defined $tree;
	 };

	 sub _build_child_tree {
	     my $self = shift;

	     return BinaryTree-&gtnew( parent =&gt $self );
	 }

DESCRIPTION
       If you've already read Moose::Cookbook::Basics::Recipe3, then this
       example should look very familiar. In fact, all we've done here is
       replace the attribute's "default" parameter with a "builder".

       In this particular case, the "default" and "builder" options act in
       exactly the same way. When the "left" or "right" attribute is read,
       Moose calls the builder method to initialize the attribute.

       Note that Moose calls the builder method on the object which has the
       attribute. Here's an example:

	 my $tree = BinaryTree-&gtnew();

	 my $left = $tree-&gtleft();

       When "$tree-&gtleft()" is called, Moose calls
       "$tree-&gt_build_child_tree()" in order to populate the "left" attribute.
       If we had passed "left" to the original constructor, the builder would
       not be called.

       There are some differences between "default" and "builder". Notably, a
       builder is subclassable, and can be composed from a role. See
       Moose::Manual::Attributes for more details.

   The lazy_build shortcut
       The "lazy_build" attribute option can be used as sugar to specify a
       whole set of attribute options at once:

	 has 'animal' =&gt (
	     is 	=&gt 'ro',
	     isa	=&gt 'Animal',
	     lazy_build =&gt 1,
	 );

       This is a shorthand for:

	 has 'animal' =&gt (
	     is        =&gt 'ro',
	     isa       =&gt 'Animal',
	     required  =&gt 1,
	     lazy      =&gt 1,
	     builder   =&gt '_build_animal',
	     predicate =&gt 'has_animal',
	     clearer   =&gt 'clear_animal',
	 );

       If your attribute starts with an underscore, Moose is smart and will do
       the right thing with the "predicate" and "clearer", making them both
       start with an underscore. The "builder" method always starts with an
       underscore.

       You can read more about "lazy_build" in Moose::Manual::Attributes

CONCLUSION
       The "builder" option is a more OO-friendly version of the "default"
       functionality. It also separates the default-generating code into a
       well-defined method. Sprinkling your attribute definitions with
       anonymous subroutines can be quite ugly and hard to follow.
