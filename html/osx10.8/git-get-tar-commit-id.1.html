NAME
       git-get-tar-commit-id - Extract commit ID from an archive created using
       git-archive

SYNOPSIS
       git get-tar-commit-id &lt &lttarfile&gt


DESCRIPTION
       Acts as a filter, extracting the commit ID stored in archives created
       by git archive. It reads only the first 1024 bytes of input, thus its
       runtime is not influenced by the size of &lttarfile&gt very much.

       If no commit ID is found, git get-tar-commit-id quietly exists with a
       return code of 1. This can happen if &lttarfile&gt had not been created
       using git archive or if the first parameter of git archive had been a
       tree ID instead of a commit ID or tag.
