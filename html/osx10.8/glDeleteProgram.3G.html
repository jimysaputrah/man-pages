GLDELETEPROGRAM(3G)		  OpenGL 3.3		   GLDELETEPROGRAM(3G)



NAME
       glDeleteProgram - Deletes a program object

C SPECIFICATION
       void glDeleteProgram(GLuint program);

PARAMETERS
       program
	   Specifies the program object to be deleted.

DESCRIPTION
       glDeleteProgram frees the memory and invalidates the name associated
       with the program object specified by program.  This command effectively
       undoes the effects of a call to glCreateProgram().

       If a program object is in use as part of current rendering state, it
       will be flagged for deletion, but it will not be deleted until it is no
       longer part of current state for any rendering context. If a program
       object to be deleted has shader objects attached to it, those shader
       objects will be automatically detached but not deleted unless they have
       already been flagged for deletion by a previous call to
       glDeleteShader(). A value of 0 for program will be silently ignored.

       To determine whether a program object has been flagged for deletion,
       call glGetProgram() with arguments program and GL_DELETE_STATUS.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if program is not a value generated by
       OpenGL.

ASSOCIATED GETS
       glGet() with argument GL_CURRENT_PROGRAM

       glGetProgram() with arguments program and GL_DELETE_STATUS

       glIsProgram()
