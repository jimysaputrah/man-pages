NAME
       MooseX::Types::Base - Type library base class

VERSION
       version 0.30

DESCRIPTION
       You normally won't need to interact with this class by yourself. It is
       merely a collection of functionality that type libraries need to
       interact with moose and the rest of the MooseX::Types module.

METHODS
   import
       Provides the import mechanism for your library. See "LIBRARY USAGE" in
       MooseX::Types for syntax details on this.

   get_type
       This returns a type from the library's store by its name.

   type_names
       Returns a list of all known types by their name.

   add_type
       Adds a new type to the library.

   has_type
       Returns true or false depending on if this library knows a type by that
       name.

   type_storage
       Returns the library's type storage hash reference. You shouldn't use
       this method directly unless you know what you are doing. It is not an
       internal method because overriding it makes virtual libraries very
       easy.

   registered_class_types
       Returns the class types registered within this library. Don't use
       directly.

   register_class_type
       Register a "class_type" for use in this library by class name.

   get_registered_class_type
       Get a "class_type" registered in this library by name.

   registered_role_types
       Returns the role types registered within this library. Don't use
       directly.

   register_role_type
       Register a "role_type" for use in this library by role name.

   get_registered_role_type
       Get a "role_type" registered in this library by role name.
