PPI::Token::Word(3)   User Contributed Perl Documentation  PPI::Token::Word(3)



NAME
       PPI::Token::Word - The generic "word" Token

INHERITANCE
	 PPI::Token::Word
	 isa PPI::Token
	     isa PPI::Element

DESCRIPTION
       A "PPI::Token::Word" object is a PPI-specific representation of several
       different types of word-like things, and is one of the most common
       Token classes found in typical documents.

       Specifically, it includes not only barewords, but also any other valid
       Perl identifier including non-operator keywords and core functions, and
       any include "::" separators inside it, as long as it fits the format of
       a class, function, etc.

METHODS
       There are no methods available for "PPI::Token::Word" beyond those
       provided by its PPI::Token and PPI::Element parent classes.

       We expect to add additional methods to help further resolve a Word as a
       function, method, etc over time.  If you need such a thing right now,
       look at Perl::Critic::Utils.

   literal
       Returns the value of the Word as a string.  This assumes (often
       incorrectly) that the Word is a bareword and not a function, method,
       keyword, etc.  This differs from "content" because "Foo'Bar" expands to
       "Foo::Bar".

   method_call
       Answers whether this is the name of a method in a method call. Returns
       true if yes, false if no, and nothing if unknown.

TO DO
       - Add "function", "method" etc detector methods

SUPPORT
       See the support section in the main module.
