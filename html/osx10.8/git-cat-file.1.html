NAME
       git-cat-file - Provide content or type and size information for
       repository objects

SYNOPSIS
       git cat-file (-t | -s | -e | -p | &lttype&gt | --textconv ) &ltobject&gt
       git cat-file (--batch | --batch-check) &lt &ltlist-of-objects&gt


DESCRIPTION
       In its first form, the command provides the content or the type of an
       object in the repository. The type is required unless -t or -p is used
       to find the object type, or -s is used to find the object size, or
       --textconv is used (which implies type "blob").

       In the second form, a list of objects (separated by linefeeds) is
       provided on stdin, and the SHA1, type, and size of each object is
       printed on stdout.

OPTIONS
       &ltobject&gt
	   The name of the object to show. For a more complete list of ways to
	   spell object names, see the "SPECIFYING REVISIONS" section in
	   gitrevisions(7).

       -t
	   Instead of the content, show the object type identified by
	   &ltobject&gt.

       -s
	   Instead of the content, show the object size identified by
	   &ltobject&gt.

       -e
	   Suppress all output; instead exit with zero status if &ltobject&gt
	   exists and is a valid object.

       -p
	   Pretty-print the contents of &ltobject&gt based on its type.

       &lttype&gt
	   Typically this matches the real type of &ltobject&gt but asking for a
	   type that can trivially be dereferenced from the given &ltobject&gt is
	   also permitted. An example is to ask for a "tree" with &ltobject&gt
	   being a commit object that contains it, or to ask for a "blob" with
	   &ltobject&gt being a tag object that points at it.

       --textconv
	   Show the content as transformed by a textconv filter. In this case,
	   &ltobject&gt has be of the form &lttreeish&gt:&ltpath&gt, or :&ltpath&gt in order
	   to apply the filter to the content recorded in the index at &ltpath&gt.

       --batch
	   Print the SHA1, type, size, and contents of each object provided on
	   stdin. May not be combined with any other options or arguments.

       --batch-check
	   Print the SHA1, type, and size of each object provided on stdin.
	   May not be combined with any other options or arguments.

OUTPUT
       If -t is specified, one of the &lttype&gt.

       If -s is specified, the size of the &ltobject&gt in bytes.

       If -e is specified, no output.

       If -p is specified, the contents of &ltobject&gt are pretty-printed.

       If &lttype&gt is specified, the raw (though uncompressed) contents of the
       &ltobject&gt will be returned.

       If --batch is specified, output of the following form is printed for
       each object specified on stdin:

	   &ltsha1&gt SP &lttype&gt SP &ltsize&gt LF
	   &ltcontents&gt LF


       If --batch-check is specified, output of the following form is printed
       for each object specified on stdin:

	   &ltsha1&gt SP &lttype&gt SP &ltsize&gt LF


       For both --batch and --batch-check, output of the following form is
       printed for each object specified on stdin that does not exist in the
       repository:

	   &ltobject&gt SP missing LF
