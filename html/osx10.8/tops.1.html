DESCRIPTION
       tops is a tool that performs in-place  substitutions  on  source  files
       according  to  a  set  of  rules. Each tops rule describes a particular
       translation. For example, one tops rule might specify that  occurrences
       of  the	token 'Application' should be converted to 'NSApplication'. In
       tops syntax, this rule will appear as:

       replace "Application" with "NSApplication"

OPTIONS
       -help  Displays the tops syntax line.

       -verbose
	      Prints out the source code lines that are being changed  by  the
	      command.

       -nocontext
	      Instead  of  printing  the  whole source code line that is being
	      changed or searched for, shows only the portion of the line that
	      has the change.

       -nofileinfo
	      Does not print the file name and line number information in ver-
	      bose messages.

       -semiverbose
	      Shows how much of the file has been processed.

       -dont  Shows what changes would be made	to  the  source  code  without
	      actually performing the changes.

       -scriptfile script_name
	      Specifies  the  script  file containing the rules that tops will
	      apply to your code. The script file can contain three  types  of
	      rules:  find, replace, and replacemethod. It also can contain C-
	      style comments, /* ... */.

       find "search_pattern"
	      Locates  all  occurrences  of  search_pattern   in   the	 file.
	      search_pattern  can  contain literal strings and tokens in angle
	      brackets, as described below.

       where ("symbol"...) isOneOf {("match"...)...}
	      When search_pattern contains tokens in angle  brackets,  further
	      refines what the token specified by symbol should match.

       replace "search_pattern" with "replacement_pattern" | same
	      Replaces	all  occurrences  of  search_pattern  in the file with
	      replacement_pattern. same replaces search_pattern  with  itself.
	      You  usually  use  same  when  you want to print out an error or
	      warning message instead of replacing the code.

       within ("symbol") {...}
	      Specifies further conversions within one of the tokens specified
	      in  search_pattern.  find,  replace, and replacemethod rules can
	      appear within the angle brackets.

       error "message"
	      Generates an #error message located at search_pattern.

       warning "message"
	      Generates a #warning message located at search_pattern.

       replacemethod "selector" with "new_selector"
	      Replaces all  invocations,  declarations,  implementations,  and
	      @selector  expressions using the method selector with new_selec-
	      tor.

       -classfile classfile
	      Specifies a file that describes the class hierarchy used by  the
	      files being processed.

       filename ...
	      Specifies  the source file(s) you want to convert. You can spec-
	      ify more than one filename, separated by spaces. The  files  are
	      converted in place; no backups are created. If no file is speci-
	      fied, the tops commands are performed on standard input.

       The simplest search pattern is a literal string, such as "Application".
       Within the search pattern, you can define tokens that specify a partic-
       ular syntax element rather than a literal string. The tokens  have  the
       form:

       &lttype label&gt

       where:

       type   Specifies the type of syntax element the token can match with.

       label  Is a unique label that you assign to the token.

       type can be one of the following:

       a      Matches any sequence of tokens.

       b      Matches  any balanced sequence of tokens, that is, a sequence of
	      tokens within parentheses or curly braces.

       e      Matches any expression. This is the default.

       s      Matches any string.

       t      Matches any one token.

       w      Matches white space, including comments.

       In a replacemethod rule, three subtokens are defined for each token you
       specify	in  the  selector.  For  each  token  &ltfoo&gt  in  the selector,
       replacemethod defines the following.  The  Examples  section  shows  an
       example of using one of these.

       &ltfoo_arg&gt
	      Represents  the tokens in the invocation of the method, that is,
	      what is supplied for the foo argument.

       &ltfoo_type&gt
	      Represents the type for foo that appears in the declaration.

       &ltfoo_param&gt
	      Represents the parameter in the declaration.

       replacemethod also defines the following labels:

       &ltimplementation&gt
	      Represents the body of the method implementation (not  including
	      curly braces).

       &ltreceiver&gt
	      Represents the receiver of the message.

       &ltcall&gt Represents  the  entire  method invocation (including the square
	      brackets).

EXAMPLES
       The following is a typical tops command	invocation.  The  script  file
       MyRules.tops  contains  the find, replace, and replacemethod rules that
       are performed on the files in  MyProjectDir.  The  -semiverbose	option
       means  that  name  of  the file being processed and the progress of the
       command will be printed to standard output.

	      tops -semiverbose -scriptfile MyRules.tops MyProjectDir/*.[hm]

       The following is a typical rule that a tops script file would  contain.
       The     rule	renames    the	  method    removeRowAt:andFree:    to
       removeRow:andRelease: in  all  invocations,  declarations,  implementa-
       tions, and @selector expressions.

	      replacemethod		"removeRowAt:andFree:"		  with
	      "removeRow:andRelease:"

       The following rule marks all calls to the  function  NXGetNamedObject()
       with  the  error message. same means replace this function with itself.
       NXGetNamedObject() will still appear in the file, but it will be marked
       by  the	error  message. &ltb args&gt specifies to replace all of the argu-
       ments in between the parentheses as well.

	      replace "NXGetNamedObject(&ltb args&gt)" with same
		  error "ApplicationConversion:  NXGetNamedObject()  is  obso-
	      lete. Replace with nib file outlets."

       The following rule renames the method in all occurrences, and swaps the
       second and third argument in all invocations and declarations.

	      replacemethod	"browser:fillMatrix:&lt2&gtinColumn:&lt3&gt"	  with
	      "browser:createRowsForColumn:&lt3&gtinMatrix:&lt2&gt"

       The  following rule renames the method in all occurrences. In the invo-
       cations, it reverses the value specified for the flag argument.

	      replacemethod "myMethod:&ltflag&gt" with "myNewMethod:&ltflag&gt"
		  { replace "&ltflag_arg&gt" with "!&ltflag_arg&gt" }

       The following rule renames the method initContent:style:backing:button-
       Mask:defer:   to  initWithContentRect:styleMask:backing:defer:  in  all
       occurrences. In the declarations of this method, it  changes  the  type
       for  the style argument to be unsigned int and the type for the backing
       argument to be NSBackingStoreType.

	      replacemethod "&ltold&gt" with "&ltnew&gt" {
		  replace "&ltstyle_type&gt" with "(unsigned int)"
		  replace "&ltbacking_type&gt" with "(NSBackingStoreType)"
		  }
		  where   ("&ltold&gt",   "&ltnew&gt")	 isOneOf   {	    ("initCon-
	      tent:style:&ltstyle&gt      backing:&ltbacking&gt     buttonMask:&ltbmask&gt
	      defer:&ltflag&gt",   "initWithContentRect:styleMask:&ltstyle&gt	 back-
	      ing:&ltbacking&gt defer:&ltflag&gt"),
		  }

       The  following  rule  renames the method minFrameWidth:forStyle:button-
       Mask: to minFrameWidthWithTitle:styleMask: in all  occurrences.	Within
       invocations  of	this  method,  it changes the style argument to be the
       logical OR of the previous style argument and the previous button  mask
       argument. Within method declarations, it changes the type for the style
       argument to be unsigned int. Within the implementation of this  method,
       it  changes all uses of the button mask argument to the style argument.

	      replacemethod	 "minFrameWidth:forStyle:&ltstyle&gt       button-
	      Mask:&ltbmask&gt" with "minFrameWidthWithTitle:styleMask:&ltstyle&gt" {
		  replace "&ltstyle_arg&gt" with "&ltstyle_arg&gt|&ltbmask_arg&gt"
		  replace "&ltstyle_type&gt" with "(unsigned int)"
		  }
		  within  ("&ltimplementation")  {       replace "&ltbmask_param&gt"
	      "&ltstyle_param&gt"
		  }
