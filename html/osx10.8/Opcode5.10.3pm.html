NAME
       Opcode - Disable named opcodes when compiling perl code

SYNOPSIS
	 use Opcode;

DESCRIPTION
       Perl code is always compiled into an internal format before execution.

       Evaluating perl code (e.g. via "eval" or "do 'file'") causes the code
       to be compiled into an internal format and then, provided there was no
       error in the compilation, executed.  The internal format is based on
       many distinct opcodes.

       By default no opmask is in effect and any code can be compiled.

       The Opcode module allow you to define an operator mask to be in effect
       when perl next compiles any code.  Attempting to compile code which
       contains a masked opcode will cause the compilation to fail with an
       error. The code will not be executed.

NOTE
       The Opcode module is not usually used directly. See the ops pragma and
       Safe modules for more typical uses.

Operator Names and Operator Lists
       The canonical list of operator names is the contents of the array
       PL_op_name defined and initialised in file opcode.h of the Perl source
       distribution (and installed into the perl library).

       Each operator has both a terse name (its opname) and a more verbose or
       recognisable descriptive name. The opdesc function can be used to
       return a list of descriptions for a list of operators.

       Many of the functions and methods listed below take a list of operators
       as parameters. Most operator lists can be made up of several types of
       element. Each element can be one of

       an operator name (opname)
	       Operator names are typically small lowercase words like
	       enterloop, leaveloop, last, next, redo etc. Sometimes they are
	       rather cryptic like gv2cv, i_ncmp and ftsvtx.

       an operator tag name (optag)
	       Operator tags can be used to refer to groups (or sets) of
	       operators.  Tag names always begin with a colon. The Opcode
	       module defines several optags and the user can define others
	       using the define_optag function.

       a negated opname or optag
	       An opname or optag can be prefixed with an exclamation mark,
	       e.g., !mkdir.  Negating an opname or optag means remove the
	       corresponding ops from the accumulated set of ops at that
	       point.

       an operator set (opset)
	       An opset as a binary string of approximately 44 bytes which
	       holds a set or zero or more operators.

	       The opset and opset_to_ops functions can be used to convert
	       from a list of operators to an opset and vice versa.

	       Wherever a list of operators can be given you can use one or
	       more opsets.  See also Manipulating Opsets below.

Opcode Functions
       The Opcode package contains functions for manipulating operator names
       tags and sets. All are available for export by the package.

       opcodes In a scalar context opcodes returns the number of opcodes in
	       this version of perl (around 350 for perl-5.7.0).

	       In a list context it returns a list of all the operator names.
	       (Not yet implemented, use @names = opset_to_ops(full_opset).)

       opset (OP, ...)
	       Returns an opset containing the listed operators.

       opset_to_ops (OPSET)
	       Returns a list of operator names corresponding to those
	       operators in the set.

       opset_to_hex (OPSET)
	       Returns a string representation of an opset. Can be handy for
	       debugging.

       full_opset
	       Returns an opset which includes all operators.

       empty_opset
	       Returns an opset which contains no operators.

       invert_opset (OPSET)
	       Returns an opset which is the inverse set of the one supplied.

       verify_opset (OPSET, ...)
	       Returns true if the supplied opset looks like a valid opset (is
	       the right length etc) otherwise it returns false. If an
	       optional second parameter is true then verify_opset will croak
	       on an invalid opset instead of returning false.

	       Most of the other Opcode functions call verify_opset
	       automatically and will croak if given an invalid opset.

       define_optag (OPTAG, OPSET)
	       Define OPTAG as a symbolic name for OPSET. Optag names always
	       start with a colon ":".

	       The optag name used must not be defined already (define_optag
	       will croak if it is already defined). Optag names are global to
	       the perl process and optag definitions cannot be altered or
	       deleted once defined.

	       It is strongly recommended that applications using Opcode
	       should use a leading capital letter on their tag names since
	       lowercase names are reserved for use by the Opcode module. If
	       using Opcode within a module you should prefix your tags names
	       with the name of your module to ensure uniqueness and thus
	       avoid clashes with other modules.

       opmask_add (OPSET)
	       Adds the supplied opset to the current opmask. Note that there
	       is currently no mechanism for unmasking ops once they have been
	       masked.	This is intentional.

       opmask  Returns an opset corresponding to the current opmask.

       opdesc (OP, ...)
	       This takes a list of operator names and returns the
	       corresponding list of operator descriptions.

       opdump (PAT)
	       Dumps to STDOUT a two column list of op names and op
	       descriptions.  If an optional pattern is given then only lines
	       which match the (case insensitive) pattern will be output.

	       It's designed to be used as a handy command line utility:

		       perl -MOpcode=opdump -e opdump
		       perl -MOpcode=opdump -e 'opdump Eval'

Manipulating Opsets
       Opsets may be manipulated using the perl bit vector operators & (and),
       | (or), ^ (xor) and ~ (negate/invert).

       However you should never rely on the numerical position of any opcode
       within the opset. In other words both sides of a bit vector operator
       should be opsets returned from Opcode functions.

       Also, since the number of opcodes in your current version of perl might
       not be an exact multiple of eight, there may be unused bits in the last
       byte of an upset. This should not cause any problems (Opcode functions
       ignore those extra bits) but it does mean that using the ~ operator
       will typically not produce the same 'physical' opset 'string' as the
       invert_opset function.

TO DO (maybe)
	   $bool = opset_eq($opset1, $opset2)  true if opsets are logically eqiv

	   $yes = opset_can($opset, @ops)      true if $opset has all @ops set

	   @diff = opset_diff($opset1, $opset2) =&gt ('foo', '!bar', ...)

		entersub leavesub leavesublv return method method_named -- XXX loops via recursion?

		leaveeval -- needed for Safe to operate, is safe without entereval

       :base_mem
	    These memory related ops are not included in :base_core because
	    they can easily be used to implement a resource attack (e.g.,
	    consume all available memory).

		concat repeat join range

		anonlist anonhash

	    Note that despite the existence of this optag a memory resource
	    attack may still be possible using only :base_core ops.

	    Disabling these ops is a very heavy handed way to attempt to
	    prevent a memory resource attack. It's probable that a specific
	    memory limit mechanism will be added to perl in the near future.

       :base_loop
	    These loop ops are not included in :base_core because they can
	    easily be used to implement a resource attack (e.g., consume all
	    available CPU time).

		grepstart grepwhile
		mapstart mapwhile
		enteriter iter
		enterloop leaveloop unstack
		last next redo
		goto

       :base_io
	    These ops enable filehandle (rather than filename) based input and
	    output. These are safe on the assumption that only pre-existing
	    filehandles are available for use.	Usually, to create new
	    filehandles other ops such as open would need to be enabled, if
	    you don't take into account the magical open of ARGV.

		readline rcatline getc read

		formline enterwrite leavewrite

		print say sysread syswrite send recv

		eof tell seek sysseek

		readdir telldir seekdir rewinddir

       :base_orig
	    These are a hotchpotch of opcodes still waiting to be considered

		gvsv gv gelem

		padsv padav padhv padany

		once

		rv2gv refgen srefgen ref

		bless -- could be used to change ownership of objects (reblessing)

		pushre regcmaybe regcreset regcomp subst substcont

		crypt

		tie untie

		dbmopen dbmclose
		sselect select
		pipe_op sockpair

		entertry leavetry -- can be used to 'hide' fatal errors

		entergiven leavegiven
		enterwhen leavewhen
		break continue
		smartmatch

		custom -- where should this go

       :base_math
	    These ops are not included in :base_core because of the risk of
	    them being used to generate floating point exceptions (which would
	    have to be caught using a $SIG{FPE} handler).

		atan2 sin cos exp log sqrt

	    These ops are not included in :base_core because they have an
	    effect beyond the scope of the compartment.

		rand srand

       :base_thread
	    These ops are related to multi-threading.

		lock

       :default
	    A handy tag name for a reasonable default set of ops.  (The
	    current ops allowed are unstable while development continues. It
	    will change.)

		:base_core :base_mem :base_loop :base_orig :base_thread

	    This list used to contain :base_io prior to Opcode 1.07.

	    If safety matters to you (and why else would you be using the
	    Opcode module?)  then you should not rely on the definition of
	    this, or indeed any other, optag!

		ftatime ftblk ftchr ftctime ftdir fteexec fteowned fteread
		ftewrite ftfile ftis ftlink ftmtime ftpipe ftrexec ftrowned

		gpwnam gpwuid gpwent spwent epwent getlogin	  -- users
		ggrnam ggrgid ggrent sgrent egrent		  -- groups

       :browse
	    A handy tag name for a reasonable default set of ops beyond the
	    :default optag.  Like :default (and indeed all the other optags)
	    its current definition is unstable while development continues. It
	    will change.

	    The :browse tag represents the next step beyond :default. It it a
	    superset of the :default ops and adds :filesys_read the :sys_db.
	    The intent being that scripts can access more (possibly sensitive)
	    information about your system but not be able to change it.

		:default :filesys_read :sys_db

       :filesys_open
		sysopen open close
		umask binmode

		open_dir closedir -- other dir ops are in :base_io

       :filesys_write
		link unlink rename symlink truncate

		mkdir rmdir

		utime chmod chown

		fcntl -- not strictly filesys related, but possibly as dangerous?

       :subprocess
		backtick system

		fork

		wait waitpid

		glob -- access to Cshell via &lt`rm *`&gt

       :ownprocess
		exec exit kill

		time tms -- could be used for timing attacks (paranoid?)

       :others
	    This tag holds groups of assorted specialist opcodes that don't
	    warrant having optags defined for them.

	    SystemV Interprocess Communications:

		msgctl msgget msgrcv msgsnd

		semctl semget semop

		shmctl shmget shmread shmwrite

       :load
	    This tag holds opcodes related to loading modules and getting
	    information about calling environment and args.

		require dofile
		caller

       :still_to_be_decided
		chdir
		flock ioctl

		socket getpeername ssockopt
		bind connect listen accept shutdown gsockopt getsockname

		sleep alarm -- changes global timer state and signal handling
		sort -- assorted problems including core dumps
		tied -- can be used to access object implementing a tie
		pack unpack -- can be used to create/use memory pointers

		entereval -- can be used to hide code from initial compile

		reset

		dbstate -- perl -d version of nextstate(ment) opcode

       :dangerous
	    This tag is simply a bucket for opcodes that are unlikely to be
	    used via a tag name but need to be tagged for completeness and
	    documentation.

		syscall dump chroot
