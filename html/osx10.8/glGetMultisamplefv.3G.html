NAME
       glGetMultisamplefv - retrieve the location of a sample

C SPECIFICATION
       void glGetMultisamplefv(GLenum pname, GLuint index, GLfloat *val);

PARAMETERS
       pname
	   Specifies the sample parameter name.  pname must be
	   GL_SAMPLE_POSITION.

       index
	   Specifies the index of the sample whose position to query.

       val
	   Specifies the address of an array to receive the position of the
	   sample.

DESCRIPTION
       glGetMultisamplefv queries the location of a given sample.  pname
       specifies the sample parameter to retrieve and must be
       GL_SAMPLE_POSITION.  index corresponds to the sample for which the
       location should be returned. The sample location is returned as two
       floating-point values in val[0] and val[1], each between 0 and 1,
       corresponding to the x and y locations respectively in the GL pixel
       space of that sample. (0.5, 0.5) this corresponds to the pixel center.
       index must be between zero and the value of GL_SAMPLES - 1.

       If the multisample mode does not have fixed sample locations, the
       returned values may only reflect the locations of samples within some
       pixels.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if pname is not one GL_SAMPLE_POSITION.


       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if index is greater than or equal to the
       value of GL_SAMPLES.
