NAME
       SSL_get_peer_certificate - get the X509 certificate of the peer

SYNOPSIS
	#include &ltopenssl/ssl.h&gt

	X509 *SSL_get_peer_certificate(const SSL *ssl);

DESCRIPTION
       SSL_get_peer_certificate() returns a pointer to the X509 certificate
       the peer presented. If the peer did not present a certificate, NULL is
       returned.

NOTES
       Due to the protocol definition, a TLS/SSL server will always send a
       certificate, if present. A client will only send a certificate when
       explicitly requested to do so by the server (see
       SSL_CTX_set_verify(3)). If an anonymous cipher is used, no certificates
       are sent.

       That a certificate is returned does not indicate information about the
       verification state, use SSL_get_verify_result(3) to check the
       verification state.

       The reference count of the X509 object is incremented by one, so that
       it will not be destroyed when the session containing the peer
       certificate is freed. The X509 object must be explicitly freed using
       X509_free().

RETURN VALUES
       The following return values can occur:

       NULL
	   No certificate was presented by the peer or no connection was
	   established.

       Pointer to an X509 certificate
	   The return value points to the certificate presented by the peer.
