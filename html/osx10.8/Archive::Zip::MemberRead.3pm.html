NAME
       Archive::Zip::MemberRead - A wrapper that lets you read Zip archive
       members as if they were files.

SYNOPSIS
	 use Archive::Zip;
	 use Archive::Zip::MemberRead;
	 $zip = Archive::Zip-&gtnew("file.zip");
	 $fh  = Archive::Zip::MemberRead-&gtnew($zip, "subdir/abc.txt");
	 while (defined($line = $fh-&gtgetline()))
	 {
	     print $fh-&gtinput_line_number . "#: $line\n";
	 }

	 $read = $fh-&gtread($buffer, 32*1024);
	 print "Read $read bytes as :$buffer:\n";

DESCRIPTION
       The Archive::Zip::MemberRead module lets you read Zip archive member
       data just like you read data from files.

METHODS
       Archive::Zip::Member::readFileHandle()
	   You can get a "Archive::Zip::MemberRead" from an archive member by
	   calling "readFileHandle()":

	     my $member = $zip-&gtmemberNamed('abc/def.c');
	     my $fh = $member-&gtreadFileHandle();
	     while (defined($line = $fh-&gtgetline()))
	     {
		 # ...
	     }
	     $fh-&gtclose();

       Archive::Zip::MemberRead-&gtnew($zip, $fileName)
       Archive::Zip::MemberRead-&gtnew($zip, $member)
       Archive::Zip::MemberRead-&gtnew($member)
	   Construct a new Archive::Zip::MemberRead on the specified member.

	     my $fh = Archive::Zip::MemberRead-&gtnew($zip, 'fred.c')

       setLineEnd(expr)
	   Set the line end character to use. This is set to \n by default
	   except on Windows systems where it is set to \r\n. You will only
	   need to set this on systems which are not Windows or Unix based and
	   require a line end diffrent from \n.  This is a class method so
	   call as "Archive::Zip::MemberRead"-&gt"setLineEnd($nl)"

       rewind()
	   Rewinds an "Archive::Zip::MemberRead" so that you can read from it
	   again starting at the beginning.

       input_record_separator(expr)
	   If the argumnet is given, input_record_separator for this instance
	   is set to it. The current setting (which may be the global $/) is
	   always returned.

       input_line_number()
	   Returns the current line number, but only if you're using
	   "getline()".  Using "read()" will not update the line number.

       close()
	   Closes the given file handle.

       buffer_size([ $size ])
	   Gets or sets the buffer size used for reads.  Default is the chunk
	   size used by Archive::Zip.

       getline()
	   Returns the next line from the currently open member.  Makes sense
	   only for text files.  A read error is considered fatal enough to
	   die.  Returns undef on eof. All subsequent calls would return
	   undef, unless a rewind() is called.	Note: The line returned has
	   the input_record_separator (default: newline) removed.

       read($buffer, $num_bytes_to_read)
	   Simulates a normal "read()" system call.  Returns the no. of bytes
	   read. "undef" on error, 0 on eof, e.g.:

	     $fh = Archive::Zip::MemberRead-&gtnew($zip, "sreeji/secrets.bin");
	     while (1)
	     {
	       $read = $fh-&gtread($buffer, 1024);
	       die "FATAL ERROR reading my secrets !\n" if (!defined($read));
	       last if (!$read);
	       # Do processing.
	       ....
	      }
