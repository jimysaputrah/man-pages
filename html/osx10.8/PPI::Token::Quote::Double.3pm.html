PPI::Token::Quote::DouUser3Contributed Perl DocumePPI::Token::Quote::Double(3)



NAME
       PPI::Token::Quote::Double - A standard "double quote" token

INHERITANCE
	 PPI::Token::Quote::Double
	 isa PPI::Token::Quote
	     isa PPI::Token
		 isa PPI::Element

DESCRIPTION
       A "PPI::Token::Quote::Double" object represents a double-quoted
       interpolating string.

       The string is treated as a single entity, PPI will not try to
       understand what is in the string during the parsing process.

METHODS
       There are several methods available for "PPI::Token::Quote::Double",
       beyond those provided by the parent PPI::Token::Quote, PPI::Token and
       PPI::Element classes.

       Got any ideas for methods? Submit a report to rt.cpan.org!

   interpolations
       The interpolations method checks to see if the double quote actually
       contains any interpolated variables.

       Returns true if the string contains interpolations, or false if not.

   simplify
       For various reasons, some people find themselves compelled to have
       their code in the simplest form possible.

       The "simply" method will turn a simple double-quoted string into the
       equivalent single-quoted string.

       If the double can be simplified, it will be modified in place and
       returned as a convenience, or returns false if the string cannot be
       simplified.

SUPPORT
       See the support section in the main module.
