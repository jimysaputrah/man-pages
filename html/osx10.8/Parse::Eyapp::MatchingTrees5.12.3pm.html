NAME
       Parse::Eyapp::treematchingtut - Tree Matching and Tree substitution: an
       introduction

TREE MATCHING AND TREE SUBSTITUTION
       Most of the examples in this section can be found in the directory
       "examples/MatchingTrees" that comes with the distribution of
       Parse::Eyapp.

   Matching Trees
       Both the transformation objects in "Parse::Eyapp::YATW" and the nodes
       in "Parse::Eyapp::Node" have a method named "m" for matching.  For a
       "Parse::Eyapp::YATW" object, the method -when called in a list context-
       returns a list of "Parse::Eyapp::Node::Match" nodes.

			   @R = $t-&gtm($yatw1, $yatw2, $yatw3, ...)

       A "Parse::Eyapp::Node::Match" object describes the nodes of the actual
       tree that have matched.	The nodes in the returned list are organized
       in a hierarchy.	They appear in the list sorted according to a depth-
       first visit of the actual tree $t.  In a scalar context "m" returns the
       first element of the list.

       Let us denote by $t the actual tree being searched and $r one of the
       "Parse::Eyapp::Node::Match" nodes in the resulting forest @R.  Then we
       have the following methods:

       o   The method "$r-&gtnode" return the node $t of the actual tree that
	   matched

       o   The method "$r-&gtfather" returns the father of $r in the matching
	   forest.  The father of $r is defined by this property:
	   "$r-&gtfather-&gtnode" is the nearest ancestor of "$r-&gtnode" that
	   matched with the treeregexp pattern.  That is, there is no ancestor
	   that matched between "$r-&gtnode" and "$r-&gtfather-&gtnode".  Otherwise
	   "$r-&gtfather" is "undef"

       o   The method "$r-&gtcoord" returns the coordinates of "$r-&gtnode"
	   relative to $t.  For example, the coordinate ".1.3.2" denotes the
	   node "$t-&gtchild(1)-&gtchild(3)-&gtchild(2)", where $t is the root of
	   the search.

       o   The method "$r-&gtdepth" returns the depth of "$r-&gtnode" in $t.

       o   When "m" was called as a "Parse::Eyapp::Node" method, i. e.	with
	   potentially more than one "YATW" treeregexp, the method "$r-&gtnames"
	   returns the array of names of the transformations that matched with
	   "$r-&gtnode".

       Use of "m" as a Parse::Eyapp::Node Method

       The example in "examples/MatchingTrees/m2.pl" shows the use of "m" as a
       "Parse::Eyapp::Node" method.

	 examples/MatchingTrees$ cat -n m2.pl
	    1  #!/usr/bin/perl -w
	    2  use strict;
	    3  use Rule6;
	    4  use Parse::Eyapp::Treeregexp;
	    5
	    6  Parse::Eyapp::Treeregexp-&gtnew( STRING =&gt q{
	    7	 fold: /TIMES|PLUS|DIV|MINUS/(NUM, NUM)
	    8	 zxw: TIMES(NUM($x), .) and { $x-&gt{attr} == 0 }
	    9	 wxz: TIMES(., NUM($x)) and { $x-&gt{attr} == 0 }
	   10  })-&gtgenerate();
	   11
	   12  # Syntax analysis
	   13  my $parser = new Rule6();
	   14  my $input = "0*0*0";
	   15  my $t = $parser-&gtRun(\$input);
	   16  print "Tree:",$t-&gtstr,"\n";
	   17
	   18  # Search
	   19  my $m = $t-&gtm(our ($fold, $zxw, $wxz));
	   20  print "Match Node:\n",$m-&gtstr,"\n";

       When executed with input "0*0*0" the program generates this output:

	 examples/MatchingTrees$ m2.pl
	 Tree:TIMES(TIMES(NUM(TERMINAL),NUM(TERMINAL)),NUM(TERMINAL))
	 Match Node:
	 Match[[TIMES:0:wxz]](Match[[TIMES:1:fold,zxw,wxz]])

       The representation of "Match" nodes by "str" deserves a comment.
       "Match" nodes have their own "info" method. It returns a string
       containing the concatenation of the class of "$r-&gtnode" (i.e. the
       actual node that matched), the depth ("$r-&gtdepth") and the names of the
       transformations that matched (as provided by the method "$r-&gtnames")

       Use of "m" as a Parse::Eyapp::YATW Method

       A second example can be found inside the file
       "examples/typechecking/Simple-Types-XXX.tar.gz".  It illustrates a use
       of "m" as a "Parse::Eyapp:YATW" method.	It solves a problem of scope
       analysis in a C compiler: matching each "RETURN" statement with the
       function that surrounds it. The parsing was already done, the AST was
       built and left in $t. The treeregexp used (see "lib/Simple/Trans.trg")
       is:

	 retscope: /FUNCTION|RETURN/

       and the code that solves the problem (see subroutine "compile" in file
       "lib/Simple/Types.eyp" is:

	# Associate each "return exp" with its "function"
	my @returns = $retscope-&gtm($t);
	for (@returns) {
	  my $node = $_-&gtnode;
	  if (ref($node) eq 'RETURN') {
	    my $function = $_-&gtfather-&gtnode;
	    $node-&gt{function}  = $function;
	    $node-&gt{t} = $function-&gt{t};
	  }
	}

       The first line gets a list of "Parse::Eyapp::Node::Match" nodes
       describing  the actual nodes that matched "/FUNCTION|RETURN/".  If the
       node described by $_ is a 'RETURN' node, the expresion "
       $_-&gtfather-&gtnode" must necessarily point to the function node that
       encloses it.

   The "SEVERITY" option of "Parse::Eyapp::Treeregexp::new"
       The "SEVERITY" option of "Parse::Eyapp::Treeregexp::new" controls the
       way matching succeeds regarding the number of children.	To illustrate
       its use let us consider the following example.  The grammar used
       "Rule6.yp" is similar to the example in the section "SYNOPSIS" in
       Parse::Eyapp::Node.

	 examples/MatchingTrees$ cat -n numchildren.pl
	    1  #!/usr/bin/perl -w
	    2  use strict;
	    3  use Rule6;
	    4  use Parse::Eyapp::Treeregexp;
	    5
	    6  sub TERMINAL::info { $_[0]{attr} }
	    7
	    8  my $severity = shift || 0;
	    9  my $input = shift || '0*2';
	   10
	   11  my $parser = new Rule6();
	   12  my $t = $parser-&gtRun(\$input);
	   13
	   14  my $transform = Parse::Eyapp::Treeregexp-&gtnew(
	   15	 STRING =&gt q{
	   16	   zero_times_whatever: TIMES(NUM($x)) and { $x-&gt{attr} == 0 } =&gt { $_[0] = $NUM }
	   17	 },
	   18	 SEVERITY =&gt $severity,
	   19	 FIRSTLINE =&gt 14,
	   20  )-&gtgenerate;
	   21
	   22  $t-&gts(our @all);
	   23
	   24  print $t-&gtstr,"\n";

       The program gets the severity level from the command line (line 9).
       The specification of the term "TIMES(NUM($x))" inside the
       transformation "zero_times_whatever" does not clearly state that
       "TIMES" must have two children.	There are several interpretations of
       the treregexp depending on the level fixed for "SEVERITY":

       o   0: "TIMES" must have at least one child. Don't care if it has more.

       o   1: "TIMES" must have exactly one child.

       o   2: "TIMES" must have exactly one child. When visit a "TIMES" node
	   with a different number of children issue a warning.

       o   3: "TIMES" must have exactly one child.  When visit a "TIMES" node
	   with a different number of children issue an error.

       Observe the change in behavior according to the level of "SEVERITY":

	 pl@nereida:~/LEyapp/examples/MatchingTrees$ numchildren.pl 0 '0*2'
	 NUM(TERMINAL[0])
	 pl@nereida:~/LEyapp/examples/MatchingTrees$ numchildren.pl 1 '0*2'
	 TIMES(NUM(TERMINAL[0]),NUM(TERMINAL[2]))
	 pl@nereida:~/LEyapp/examples/MatchingTrees$ numchildren.pl 2 '0*2'
	 Warning! found node TIMES with 2 children.
	 Expected 1 children (see line 15 of ./numchildren.pl)"
	 TIMES(NUM(TERMINAL[0]),NUM(TERMINAL[2]))
	 pl@nereida:~/LEyapp/examples/MatchingTrees$ numchildren.pl 3 '0*2'
	 Error! found node TIMES with 2 children.
	 Expected 1 children (see line 15 of ./numchildren.pl)"
	  at (eval 3) line 29

   Tree Substitution: The "s" methods
       Both "Parse::Eyapp:Node" and "Parse::Eyapp::YATW" objects (i.e.	nodes
       and tree transformations) are provided with a "s" method.

       In the case of a "Parse::Eyapp::YATW" object the method "s" applies the
       tree transformation using a single bottom-up traversing: the
       transformation is recursively applied to the children and then to the
       current node.

       For "Parse::Eyapp:Node" nodes the set of transformations is applied to
       each node until no transformation matches any more.  The example in the
       section "SYNOPSIS" in Parse::Eyapp::Node illustrates the use:

	 1  # Let us transform the tree. Define the tree-regular expressions ..
	 2  my $p = Parse::Eyapp::Treeregexp-&gtnew( STRING =&gt q{
	 3    { #  Example of support code
	 4	my %Op = (PLUS=&gt'+', MINUS =&gt '-', TIMES=&gt'*', DIV =&gt '/');
	 5    }
	 6    constantfold: /TIMES|PLUS|DIV|MINUS/:bin(NUM($x), NUM($y))
	 7	=&gt {
	 8	  my $op = $Op{ref($_[0])};
	 9	  $x-&gt{attr} = eval  "$x-&gt{attr} $op $y-&gt{attr}";
	10	  $_[0] = $NUM[0];
	11	}
	12    uminus: UMINUS(NUM($x)) =&gt { $x-&gt{attr} = -$x-&gt{attr}; $_[0] = $NUM }
	13    zero_times_whatever: TIMES(NUM($x), .) and { $x-&gt{attr} == 0 } =&gt { $_[0] = $NUM }
	14    whatever_times_zero: TIMES(., NUM($x)) and { $x-&gt{attr} == 0 } =&gt { $_[0] = $NUM }
	15    },
	16    OUTPUTFILE=&gt 'main.pm'
	17  );
	18  $p-&gtgenerate(); # Create the tranformations
	19
	20  $t-&gts($uminus); # Transform UMINUS nodes
	21  $t-&gts(@all);    # constant folding and mult. by zero

       The call at line 20 can be substituted by "$uminus-&gts($t)" without
       changes.
