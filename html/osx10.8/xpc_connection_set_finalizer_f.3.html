DESCRIPTION
     Connections are the fundamental primitives for sending and receiving mes-
     sages.  Connections also inform the caller of certain non-message events
     through errors.

     Messages sent to a connection are sent in FIFO order, and message-send
     operations over a connection are non-blocking. When a message is sent
     over a connection, it is atomically enqueued on a queue which is managed
     by the XPC runtime. As it becomes possible to successfully deliver mes-
     sages to the remote end of the connection, messages will be dequeued from
     the queue and delivered.

     Connections may either be used to communicate with XPC services residing
     within an application bundle or with a MachService advertised by a
     launchd job in its launchd.plist(5).  XPC connections maintain a one-to-
     one relationship between the local and remote ends of the connection.
     Therefore, for every connection created to a service, the remote end will
     see a distinct peer connection object. This model is semantically similar
     to the accept(3) model, whereby the server listens on a single file
     descriptor, and that listening descriptor emits new file descriptors for
     each connection that occurs.

EVENT HANDLERS
     Each connection must have an event handler associated with it. The event
     handler block takes one argument of type xpc_object_t.  The event handler
     block will deliver different types of objects depending on the nature of
     the event.

     The type of object can be queried using xpc_get_type(3).  If the event
     handler block delivers an object of type XPC_TYPE_DICTIONARY, the event
     is a message that needs processing. If the event handler delivers an
     object of type XPC_TYPE_ERROR, an error has occurred on the connection
     that must be handled.

     Regardless of the type of object passed to the event handler, the caller
     will NOT implicitly gain a reference to the object. Therefore, if the
     caller wishes to work with the object after the event handler has
     returned, it should call xpc_retain(3) to keep a reference on the object
     for itself from within the event handler. It is unsafe to retain the
     object after the event handler has returned.

     The event handler of a connection may be changed while the connection is
     processing events using the xpc_connection_set_event_handler() API. Calls
     to this API will not interrupt currently-executing invocations of the
     connection's event handler.  Once the currently-executing event handler
     returns, the new event handler will take effect. If called from within
     the event handler itself, the next invocation of the event handler will
     honor the new one set.

TARGET QUEUES
     Each connection has an associated target queue. All connection-related
     activity will happen on an internal queue which is synchronized with the
     target queue.  Event handler invocations are included in connection-
     related activity. The target queue may be changed while the connection is
     processing events using the xpc_connection_set_target_queue() API. Set-
     ting of the target queue on a connection is asynchronous, and the caller
     should not assume that when this API returns, the new target queue is in
     effect.  The actual change will take place at a later time.

     By default, all connections target the DISPATCH_TARGET_QUEUE_DEFAULT(3)
     queue. This queue will be used if NULL is given as the targetq argument
     to xpc_connection_set_target_queue(), xpc_connection_create() or
     xpc_connection_create_mach_service()

     Important: The result of calling dispatch_get_current_queue(3) from
     within a connection's event handler is undefined and should not be con-
     sidered reliable for attempting to avoid deadlocks.

LAUNCH-ON-DEMAND
     When the caller obtains a connection to a named service, the fact that it
     has a connection does not imply anything about whether the remote end is
     alive and running. Connections are virtual, and if the remote end is not
     yet running, the act of sending a message will cause it to launch on-
     demand.

     If the caller has a connection to a named service, then the remote
     process closing the connection or crashing will deliver the
     XPC_ERROR_CONNECTION_INTERRUPTED error to the event handler. This error
     is recoverable, and after receiving it, the connection is still usable.
     If the caller had previously sent state over the connection, this error
     indicates that that state should be updated, if needed, and resent.

     NOTE: Services work best when they are as stateless as possible. Even if
     you write perfectly bug-free code, the libraries and frameworks your ser-
     vice links against may have bugs that could crash the service. So a ser-
     vice must be able to recover from such abnormal exits.

     One strategy for implementing a robust and recoverable service is to have
     each client of the service maintain state for the service. If the service
     crashes, then each client will detect that condition and resend the
     needed state to the service so that it can resume any interrupted opera-
     tions.

PEERING
     The local and remote ends of a connection have a one-to-one association.
     So when a new connection to a service is created and has a message sent
     over it, the service will receive a new connection in the event handler
     it specified to xpc_main(3).  If the service is a MachService advertised
     by launchd(8), then the listener connection for the named service will
     receive the new connection in its event handler.

     Even if the same process creates multiple connections to the same ser-
     vice, each connection will be distinct. The peer connection received by
     the service will deliver XPC_ERROR_CONNECTION_INVALID to its event han-
     dler when the connection has been closed. These peer connections cannot
     be re-created by the XPC runtime, and therefore they will never deliver
     the XPC_ERROR_CONNECTION_INTERRUPTED error to their event handlers.

SUSPEND AND RESUME
     All connections are created in a suspended state. Therefore, they will
     not begin processing messages or events until an initial call to
     xpc_connection_resume().  Before making this first call to resume the
     connection, the caller must set an event handler using
     xpc_connection_set_event_handler().  Note that the initial resume does
     not need to immediately follow setting the event handler. The caller is
     free to delay the initial resume as long as it chooses.

     Once a connection has been resumed, it may be suspended to halt the pro-
     cessing of incoming events and outgoing messages. This behavior is useful
     to rate-limit or throttle over-active clients who are sending too many
     messages or to allow certain synchronization behaviors with the internal
     state engine.

     Each connection maintains a suspend count, so xpc_connection_suspend()
     may be called multiple times on the same connection. The connection will
     resume processing events when an equal number of calls to
     xpc_connection_resume() have been performed on the connection, resetting
     the suspend count to zero.

     Important: All calls to xpc_connection_suspend() must be balanced by a
     call to xpc_connection_resume() before the final reference on a connec-
     tion is released. It is not valid to release the last reference on a sus-
     pended connection.

     Important: It is invalid to underflow the suspend count by calling
     xpc_connection_resume() more times than xpc_connection_suspend() has been
     called.

CONTEXT
     Connections may have associated context that can be set and retrieved
     using the xpc_connection_set_context() and xpc_connection_get_context()
     APIs, respectively. When setting context on a connection, an optional
     finalizer may be specified using xpc_connection_set_finalizer_f().  The
     function given as the finalizer argument will be invoked just before the
     connection's memory is being deallocated. For simple context structures
     allocated through malloc(3), this provides a convenient shortcut. For
     example:

	   struct my_context_s *ctx = malloc(sizeof(*ctx));
	   xpc_connection_set_context(connection, ctx);
	   xpc_connection_set_finalizer_f(connection, free);

     Important: The connection object itself should not be referenced or modi-
     fied in any way within the context of the finalizer.

MESSAGE SENDING
     Messages are sent to the remote end of a connection with the
     xpc_connection_send_message() API. This API will enqueue the message in a
     FIFO queue which will be drained asynchronously by the XPC runtime. The
     caller should not assume that, when this API returns, the message has
     been delivered to the remote end. If the caller needs to know when the
     message has been processed by the runtime, it should call the
     xpc_connection_send_barrier() API directly after calling
     xpc_connection_send_message().  The supplied barrier block will be
     invoked by the connection when the runtime has finished processing the
     message.

     Important: The caller should not assume that the remote end of the con-
     nection has received the message before a barrier is invoked. Even though
     the message has been delivered to the remote end, the remote end may not
     have yet been scheduled for execution or may have suspended its end of
     the connection. The only way for the sender to know whether the remote
     end has received the message is to specify in its message protocol that
     the remote end must send a message back to the sender acknowledging
     receipt of the message.

REPLY MESSAGES
     By default, all messages sent to a connection will result in an invoca-
     tion of the remote end's connection's event handler with that message as
     the argument.  If the caller wishes to tie the invocation of a particular
     block to a reply to a particular message, however, it may use the
     xpc_connection_send_message_with_reply() API. Like
     xpc_connection_send_message(), this API will return immediately and, when
     the remote end sends a reply back, the supplied handler block will be
     submitted to the supplied targetq instead of causing the connection's
     event handler to be invoked. The reply handler block may deliver an error
     to the caller, which indicates that the remote end will never send a
     reply.

     xpc_dictionary_create_reply(3) and sending it to its peer connection as
     it normally would. The caller must, in turn, specify in the message
     itself whether it expects a reply to be delivered.

     CLIENT SIDE

	   xpc_connection_send_message_with_reply(connection, message, replyq, ^(xpc_object_t reply) {
		   if (xpc_get_type(reply) == XPC_TYPE_DICTIONARY) {
			   // Process reply message that is specific to the message sent.
		   } else {
			   // There was an error, indicating that the caller will never receive
			   // a reply to this message. Tear down any associated data structures.
		   }
	   });

     SERVICE SIDE

	   void
	   handle_message(xpc_object_t message)
	   {
		   if (xpc_dictionary_get_bool(message, "ExpectsReply")) {
			   // Sender has set the protocol-defined "ExpectsReply" key, and therefore
			   // it expects the reply to be delivered specially.
			   xpc_object_t reply = xpc_dictionary_create_reply(message);
			   // Populate 'reply' as a normal dictionary.

			   // This is the connection from which the message originated.
			   xpc_connection_t remote = xpc_dictionary_get_remote_connection(message);
			   xpc_connection_send_message(remote, reply);
			   xpc_release(reply);
		   } else {
			   // The sender does not expect any kind of special reply.
		   }
	   }

     Important: The invocations of reply handlers are independent of the con-
     nection's normal incoming message stream. Therefore, reply messages are
     delivered to the recipient independently of the connection's normal FIFO
     semantics.

SYNCHRONOUS OPERATION
     If the caller needs to block execution until a reply to a message is
     received, it should use the xpc_connection_send_message_with_reply_sync()
     API. This result of this API will be the reply sent by the server. Like
     the handler given to xpc_connection_send_message_with_reply(), this API
     may return errors indicating that the remote end of the connection will
     never deliver a reply.

     Important: This API is primarily intended for allowing existing synchro-
     nous API to be re- implemented in terms of XPC. But in cases where the
     you are designing a new API that calls  out to a service to retrieve a
     value, we strongly encourage you to have the API return the value asyn-
     chronously using a queue/block pair rather than blocking the caller until
     the service returns the requested value:

	   void
	   retrieve_uint64(dispatch_queue_t q, void (^reply)(uint64_t value))
	   {
		   xpc_object_t message = xpc_dictionary_create(NULL, NULL, 0);
		   xpc_dictionary_set_string(message, "RetrieveValue", "uint64");

		   // 'connection' is a previously-created singleton.
		   xpc_dictionary_send_message_with_reply(_g_connection, message, q, ^(xpc_object_t reply) {
			   if (xpc_get_type(reply) == XPC_TYPE_DICTIONARY) {
				   uint64_t value = xpc_dictionary_get_uint64(reply, "Value");
				   // 'reply' is captured by this block and copied to the heap. It will
				   // be released when this block is disposed of.
				   reply(value);
			   } else {
				   // Invoke 'reply' with a value indicating that there was an error.
			   }
			   xpc_release(message);
		   });
	   }

     However, such a scheme may introduce unwanted complexity in the API. The
     trade- off for making the example implementation above synchronous
     involves factors such as where the data for the response comes from and
     how likely it is that the API will be called on the main thread.

     If the response will be constructed with data that exists in-memory in
     the server, it is usually safe to make the API synchronous. But if con-
     structing the response requires I/O, and it is likely to be called from
     the main thread (or a thread which synchronizes with the main thread), we
     highly encourage that you take the asynchronous route to avoid the risk
     of blocking the UI.

CREDENTIALS
     Identifying information about the sending processs can be obtained from a
     connection. Available credential information includes the sending process
     identifer (PID), effective user identifier (EUID), effective group iden-
     tifier (EGID) and audit session identifier (ASID).  These values can be
     obtained with the functions xpc_connection_get_pid(),
     xpc_connection_get_euid(), xpc_connection_get_egid() and
     xpc_connection_get_asid() respectively.

     Credentials for a connection may not be immediately available. For exam-
     ple, when creating a new connection with xpc_connection_create(), XPC
     will not know the credentials of the remote end of the connection until
     it has actually exchanged messages with it. Until this credential infor-
     mation is filled in, these methods will return sensible values to indi-
     cate absence of crucial information.  xpc_connection_get_pid() will
     return 0, xpc_connection_get_euid() and xpc_connection_get_egid() will
     return -1 and xpc_connection_get_asid() will return AU_ASSIGN_ASID (see
     setaudit_addr(2)).

     For peer connections received through a listener's event handler or
     through the handler given to xpc_main(3), credentials will be immediately
     available.

     Connection credentials have similar semantics to file descriptor creden-
     tials.  That is, the credentials that the connection was created with are
     "baked in" to it and do not change as a result of calls to setuid(3) and
     friends. Use of these APIs is heavily discouraged in IPC protocols due to
     the inherently racy nature of credential checking.

     Important: PIDs on OS X roll over when they reach a relatively small
     value, and a given PID cannot be assumed to be unique for a given boot
     session. For services bundled with an application, this is not a practi-
     cal concern because the application is the only process capable of look-
     ing up its services. But MachServices advertised through launchd have a
     much higher visibility, so extra care should be taken when checking cre-
     dentials to mitigate fork(2) bomb-style attacks.

CANCELLATION
     A connection may be canceled when it is no longer needed. Once canceled,
     a connection will receive the XPC_ERROR_CONNECTION_INVALID error in its
     event handler, and no further events will be delivered.  Cancellation
     does not affect the reference count of the connection, so if you hold
     references to the connection, they must still be released in order for
     all of the connection's associated resources to be freed.

     Note that, if a connection receives XPC_ERROR_CONNECTION_INVALID in its
     event handler due to other circumstances, it is already in a canceled
     state, and therefore a call to xpc_connection_cancel() is unnecessary
     (but harmless) in this case.

     Canceling a connection on one side has effects on the other side of a
     connection. For example, if you cancel a connection received through a
     listener connection's event handler, the remote peer connection will
     receive XPC_ERROR_CONNECTION_INTERRUPTED in its event handler. Even
     though the connection was canceled, the remote end is still able to send
     messages to the connection.

     If, on the other hand, the creator of a named connection cancels the con-
     nection, the peer connection given to the remote end through a listener
     connection's will receive XPC_ERROR_CONNECTION_INVALID in its event han-
     dler.

     Important: As discussed previously, some connections (such as named con-
     nections created through xpc_connection_create()) will not receive
     XPC_ERROR_CONNECTION_INVALID in the normal course of their operation. But
     if another part of your code can end up calling xpc_connection_cancel(),
     then the connection's event handler must handle this error.

BUNDLED SERVICES
     Applications may include XPC service bundles in their own bundle. When
     the application is run, the XPC runtime automatically recognizes each
     bundled service and makes it accessible to the application through the
     xpc_connection_create() API. To connect to a bundled service, the caller
     must pass the CFBundleIdentifier specified in the service's Info.plist as
     the name argument. The service itself will call xpc_main(3) to initialize
     its runtime, and the provided event handler function will be invoked with
     any incoming connections.

     Services bundled with an application are only accessible to that applica-
     tion. An external process cannot connect to those services.

MACH SERVICES
     If a caller wishes to connect to a MachService advertised in a
     launchd.plist(5), it should pass the MachService name to which is wishes
     to connect to xpc_connection_create_mach_service().  If the destination
     service is advertised in the root Mach bootstrap (i.e. the
     launchd.plist(5) lives in /Library/LaunchDaemons), the caller may ensure
     that the service that it connects to is privileged and not being spoofed
     through a man-in-the-middle attack by OR'ing the
     XPC_CONNECTION_MACH_SERVICE_PRIVILEGED flag into the flags argument. This
     flag will cause XPC_ERROR_CONNECTION_INVALID to be given to the event
     handler if the service name was not found in the root Mach bootstrap. If
     the launchd.plist(5) lives in /Library/LaunchAgents or ~/Library/LaunchA-
     gents, then this flag should not be passed.

     The launchd job using XPC is required to create a listener connection
     manually by calling xpc_connection_create_mach_service() with the
     XPC_CONNECTION_MACH_SERVICE_LISTENER flag OR'ed into the flags argument.
     The XPC_CONNECTION_MACH_SERVICE_PRIVILGED flag has no effect on these
     connections. This connection will only ever deliver new peer connections
     to its event handler. The connections received by the event handler must
     have an event hander set on them and resumed, just like the peer connec-
     tions delivered to the handler given to xpc_main(3).

	   int
	   main(void)
	   {
		   xpc_connection_t listener = xpc_connection_create_mach_service("com.apple.myservice", NULL, XPC_CONNECTION_MACH_SERVICE_LISTENER);
		   xpc_connection_set_event_handler(listener, ^(xpc_object_t peer) {
			   // It is safe to case 'peer' to xpc_connection_t.
			   xpc_connection_set_event_handler(peer, ^(xpc_object_t event) {
				   // Handle event, whether it is a message or an error.
			   });
			   xpc_connection_resume(peer);
		   });
		   xpc_connection_resume(listener);

		   dispatch_main();
		   exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
	   }

     Important: New service names may NOT be dynamically registered using Only
     launchd jobs may listen on certain service names, and any service name
     that the job wishes to listen on must be declared in its
     launchd.plist(5).	XPC may make allowances for dynamic name registration
     in debug scenarios, but these allowances absolutely will NOT be made in
     the production scenario.

ANONYMOUS CONNECTIONS
     If a caller wishes to create a listener connection that is not bound to a
     particular service name, it may create an anonymous listener connection
     by calling xpc_connection_create() and passing NULL as the name.  This
     connection may be given to xpc_endpoint_create(3), and the result may be
     embedded in a message. The recipient of that message will then be able to
     create a connection from that endpoint using
     xpc_connection_create_from_endpoint().

     The resulting connection will behave like a connection to a named service
     created using xpc_connection_create().  The fundamental difference is
     that an anonymous connection is not backed a name that can be looked up.
     Therefore, if an connection created from an endpoint is closed, there is
     no guarantee that it can be re-established. So anonymous connections'
     event handlers must always handle both the
     XPC_ERROR_CONNECTION_INTERRUPTED and XPC_ERROR_CONNECTION_INVALID errors.

     The endpoint type may be thought of as a boxed connection, in the same
     way that the uint64 type is a boxed uint64_t.  Like other types, the col-
     lection APIs provide primitive setters and getters for connections, so
     instead of first boxing a connection in an endpoint, the
     xpc_dictionary_set_connection(3), xpc_dictionary_create_connection(3),
     xpc_array_set_connection(3), and xpc_array_create_connection(3) APIs may
     be used.
