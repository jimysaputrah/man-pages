NAME
       glMultMatrixd,  glMultMatrixf  -  multiply  the current matrix with the
       specified matrix


C SPECIFICATION
       void glMultMatrixd( const GLdouble *m )
       void glMultMatrixf( const GLfloat *m )


PARAMETERS
       m  Points to 16 consecutive values that are used as the elements of a 4
	  x 4 column-major matrix.

DESCRIPTION
       glMultMatrix multiplies the current matrix with the one specified using
       m, and replaces the current matrix with the product.

       The current matrix is  determined  by  the  current  matrix  mode  (see
       glMatrixMode). It is either the projection matrix, modelview matrix, or
       the texture matrix.

EXAMPLES
       If the current matrix is C, and the coordinates to be transformed  are,
       v  =  (v[0], v[1], v[2], v[3]).	Then the current transformation is C X
       v, or

	c[0]  c[4]  c[8]  c[12]     v[0]
	c[1]  c[5]  c[9]  c[13]     v[1]
	c[2]  c[6]  c[10] c[14]  X  v[2]
	c[3]  c[7]  c[11] c[15]     v[3]

       Calling glMultMatrix with an argument of m =  m[0],  m[1],  ...,  m[15]
       replaces the current transformation with (C X M) x v, or

	c[0]  c[4]  c[8]  c[12]   m[0]	m[4]  m[8]  m[12]   v[0]
	c[1]  c[5]  c[9]  c[13]   m[1]	m[5]  m[9]  m[13]   v[1]
	c[2]  c[6]  c[10] c[14] X m[2]	m[6]  m[10] m[14] X v[2]
	c[3]  c[7]  c[11] c[15]   m[3]	m[7]  m[11] m[15]   v[3]



       Where  'X' denotes matrix multiplication, and v is represented as a 4 X
       1 matrix.

NOTES
       While the elements of the matrix may be specified with single or double
       precision,  the	GL  may  store or operate on these values in less than
       single precision.

       In many computer languages 4 X 4 arrays are  represented  in  row-major
       order.  The  transformations just described represent these matrices in
       column-major order.  The order of the multiplication is important.  For
       example,  if the current transformation is a rotation, and glMultMatrix
       is called with a translation matrix, the translation is	done  directly
       on the coordinates to be transformed, while the rotation is done on the
       results of that translation.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if glMultMatrix is  executed  between
       the execution of glBegin and the corresponding execution of glEnd.
