NAME
       RSA_public_encrypt, RSA_private_decrypt - RSA public key cryptography

SYNOPSIS
	#include <openssl/rsa.h>

	int RSA_public_encrypt(int flen, unsigned char *from,
	   unsigned char *to, RSA *rsa, int padding);

	int RSA_private_decrypt(int flen, unsigned char *from,
	    unsigned char *to, RSA *rsa, int padding);

DESCRIPTION
       RSA_public_encrypt() encrypts the flen bytes at from (usually a session
       key) using the public key rsa and stores the ciphertext in to. to must
       point to RSA_size(rsa) bytes of memory.

       padding denotes one of the following modes:

       RSA_PKCS1_PADDING
	   PKCS #1 v1.5 padding. This currently is the most widely used mode.

       RSA_PKCS1_OAEP_PADDING
	   EME-OAEP as defined in PKCS #1 v2.0 with SHA-1, MGF1 and an empty
	   encoding parameter. This mode is recommended for all new
	   applications.

       RSA_SSLV23_PADDING
	   PKCS #1 v1.5 padding with an SSL-specific modification that denotes
	   that the server is SSL3 capable.

       RSA_NO_PADDING
	   Raw RSA encryption. This mode should only be used to implement
	   cryptographically sound padding modes in the application code.
	   Encrypting user data directly with RSA is insecure.

       flen must be less than RSA_size(rsa) - 11 for the PKCS #1 v1.5 based
       padding modes, less than RSA_size(rsa) - 41 for RSA_PKCS1_OAEP_PADDING
       and exactly RSA_size(rsa) for RSA_NO_PADDING.  The random number
       generator must be seeded prior to calling RSA_public_encrypt().

       RSA_private_decrypt() decrypts the flen bytes at from using the private
       key rsa and stores the plaintext in to. to must point to a memory
       section large enough to hold the decrypted data (which is smaller than
       RSA_size(rsa)). padding is the padding mode that was used to encrypt
       the data.

RETURN VALUES
       RSA_public_encrypt() returns the size of the encrypted data (i.e.,
       RSA_size(rsa)). RSA_private_decrypt() returns the size of the recovered
       plaintext.

       On error, -1 is returned; the error codes can be obtained by
       ERR_get_error(3).

CONFORMING TO
       SSL, PKCS #1 v2.0

SEE ALSO
       ERR_get_error(3), rand(3), rsa(3), RSA_size(3)

HISTORY
       The padding argument was added in SSLeay 0.8. RSA_NO_PADDING is
       available since SSLeay 0.9.0, OAEP was added in OpenSSL 0.9.2b.
