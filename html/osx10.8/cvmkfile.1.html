NAME
       cvmkfile - Create a pre-allocated file

SYNOPSIS
       cvmkfile [-k &ltkey&gt] [-p] [-s] [-w] [-z] &ltsize&gt[k|m|g|t] &ltfilename&gt



DESCRIPTION
       cvmkfile  can  be used to pre-allocate a file on the Xsan volume.  This
       is useful and preferable when preparing a file for use in  a  real-time
       or  streaming environment as the entire file is represented in only one
       file system extent. Additionally, a file can be placed onto a  specific
       storage pool by specifying the &ltkey&gt value, which is used as the affin-
       ity locator. See snfs_config(5) for more details about affinities.


USAGE
       The -k &ltkey&gt optionally tells the file system where to place  the  data
       file.   If  an Affinity Key is specified, the file is placed on storage
       pools that are specified to support this key. If there  is  no  storage
       pool  with  the key specified, then the file is placed in non-exclusive
       data pools. If there are no non-exclusive data pools, then  ENOSPC  (no
       space) is returned.

       The -p option forces the allocation and any subsequent expansions to be
       fitted "perfectly" as multiples	of  the  PerfectFitSize  configuration
       parameter.  The	allocation extent will always line up on and be a per-
       fect multiple of the number of blocks specified in PerfectFitSize.

       The -s option forces the allocation to line up on the  beginning  block
       modulus	of  the  storage pool. This can help performance in situations
       where the I/O size perfectly spans the  width  of  the  storage	pool's
       disks.

       The  -w	option	sets the file size to be equal to &ltsize&gt. Without this
       option the blocks are allocated but the size  is  set  to  zero.  NOTE:
       Unless the -z option is used, the new file will contain undefined data.
       Using the -w option is not recommended unless absolutely needed.

       The -z option causes the file to be physically  zeroed  out.  This  can
       take a significant amount of time.

       The  &ltsize&gt  argument  specifies  the  number  of  bytes, kilobytes(k),
       megabytes(m), gigabytes(g), terabytes(t)  to  allocate  for  the  file.
       There  is  no guarantee that all requested space will be allocated.  If
       there  is  insufficient	contiguous  available  space  to  satisfy  the
       requested  amount then a "best effort" will be performed.  In this case
       a success value is returned even though not all of the requested amount
       is  allocated to the file.  Even though the allocation may not be fully
       satisfied, if the -w option is specified then the file size will  still
       reflect the requested &ltsize&gt value.

EXAMPLES
       Make  a file of one gigabyte with zero length. Allocate it on a storage
       pool that has specified the affinity key 6100_n8.

	  rock # cvmkfile -k 6100_n8 1g foobar
