NAME
       Moose::Meta::Attribute::Native::Trait::String - Helper trait for Str
       attributes

VERSION
       version 2.0205

SYNOPSIS
	 package MyHomePage;
	 use Moose;

	 has 'text' => (
	     traits  => ['String'],
	     is      => 'rw',
	     isa     => 'Str',
	     default => q{},
	     handles => {
		 add_text     => 'append',
		 replace_text => 'replace',
	     },
	 );

	 my $page = MyHomePage->new();
	 $page->add_text("foo");    # same as $page->text($page->text . "foo");

DESCRIPTION
       This trait provides native delegation methods for strings.

DEFAULT TYPE
       If you don't provide an "isa" value for your attribute, it will default
       to "Str".

PROVIDED METHODS
       o   inc

	   Increments the value stored in this slot using the magical string
	   autoincrement operator. Note that Perl doesn't provide analogous
	   behavior in "--", so "dec" is not available. This method returns
	   the new value.

	   This method does not accept any arguments.

       o   append($string)

	   Appends to the string, like ".=", and returns the new value.

	   This method requires a single argument.

       o   prepend($string)

	   Prepends to the string and returns the new value.

	   This method requires a single argument.

       o   replace($pattern, $replacement)

	   Performs a regexp substitution ("s" in perlop). There is no way to
	   provide the "g" flag, but code references will be accepted for the
	   replacement, causing the regex to be modified with a single "e".
	   "/smxi" can be applied using the "qr" operator. This method returns
	   the new value.

	   This method requires two arguments.

       o   match($pattern)

	   Runs the regex against the string and returns the matching
	   value(s).

	   This method requires a single argument.

       o   chop

	   Just like "chop" in perlfunc. This method returns the chopped
	   character.

	   This method does not accept any arguments.

       o   chomp

	   Just like "chomp" in perlfunc. This method returns the number of
	   characters removed.

	   This method does not accept any arguments.

       o   clear

	   Sets the string to the empty string (not the value passed to
	   "default").

	   This method does not have a defined return value.

	   This method does not accept any arguments.

       o   length

	   Just like "length" in perlfunc, returns the length of the string.

       o   substr

	   This acts just like "substr" in perlfunc. When called as a writer,
	   it returns the substring that was replaced, just like the Perl
	   builtin.

	   This method requires at least one argument, and accepts no more
	   than three.
