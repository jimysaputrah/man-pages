NAME
       Pod::ParseUtils - helpers for POD parsing and conversion

SYNOPSIS
	 use Pod::ParseUtils;

	 my $list = new Pod::List;
	 my $link = Pod::Hyperlink->new('Pod::Parser');

DESCRIPTION
       Pod::ParseUtils contains a few object-oriented helper packages for POD
       parsing and processing (i.e. in POD formatters and translators).

   Pod::List
       Pod::List can be used to hold information about POD lists (written as
       =over ... =item ... =back) for further processing.  The following
       methods are available:

       Pod::List->new()
	   Create a new list object. Properties may be specified through a
	   hash reference like this:

	     my $list = Pod::List->new({ -start => $., -indent => 4 });

	   See the individual methods/properties for details.

       $list->file()
	   Without argument, retrieves the file name the list is in. This must
	   have been set before by either specifying -file in the new() method
	   or by calling the file() method with a scalar argument.

       $list->start()
	   Without argument, retrieves the line number where the list started.
	   This must have been set before by either specifying -start in the
	   new() method or by calling the start() method with a scalar
	   argument.

       $list->indent()
	   Without argument, retrieves the indent level of the list as
	   specified in "=over n". This must have been set before by either
	   specifying -indent in the new() method or by calling the indent()
	   method with a scalar argument.

       $list->type()
	   Without argument, retrieves the list type, which can be an
	   arbitrary value, e.g. "OL", "UL", ... when thinking the HTML way.
	   This must have been set before by either specifying -type in the
	   new() method or by calling the type() method with a scalar
	   argument.

       $list->rx()
	   Without argument, retrieves a regular expression for simplifying
	   the individual item strings once the list type has been determined.
	   Usage: E.g. when converting to HTML, one might strip the leading
	   number in an ordered list as "<OL>" already prints numbers itself.
	   This must have been set before by either specifying -rx in the
	   new() method or by calling the rx() method with a scalar argument.

       $list->item()
	   Without argument, retrieves the array of the items in this list.
	   The items may be represented by any scalar.	If an argument has
	   been given, it is pushed on the list of items.

       $list->parent()
	   Without argument, retrieves information about the parent holding
	   this list, which is represented as an arbitrary scalar.  This must
	   have been set before by either specifying -parent in the new()
	   method or by calling the parent() method with a scalar argument.

       $list->tag()
	   Without argument, retrieves information about the list tag, which
	   can be any scalar.  This must have been set before by either
	   specifying -tag in the new() method or by calling the tag() method
	   with a scalar argument.

   Pod::Hyperlink
       Pod::Hyperlink is a class for manipulation of POD hyperlinks. Usage:

	 my $link = Pod::Hyperlink->new('alternative text|page/"section in page"');

       The Pod::Hyperlink class is mainly designed to parse the contents of
       the "L<...>" sequence, providing a simple interface for accessing the
       different parts of a POD hyperlink for further processing. It can also
       be used to construct hyperlinks.

       Pod::Hyperlink->new()
	   The new() method can either be passed a set of key/value pairs or a
	   single scalar value, namely the contents of a "L<...>" sequence. An
	   object of the class "Pod::Hyperlink" is returned. The value "undef"
	   indicates a failure, the error message is stored in $@.

       $link->parse($string)
	   This method can be used to (re)parse a (new) hyperlink, i.e. the
	   contents of a "L<...>" sequence. The result is stored in the
	   current object.  Warnings are stored in the warnings property.
	   E.g. sections like "L<open(2)>" are deprecated, as they do not
	   point to Perl documents. "L<DBI::foo(3p)>" is wrong as well, the
	   manpage section can simply be dropped.

       $link->markup($string)
	   Set/retrieve the textual value of the link. This string contains
	   special markers "P<>" and "Q<>" that should be expanded by the
	   translator's interior sequence expansion engine to the formatter-
	   specific code to highlight/activate the hyperlink. The details have
	   to be implemented in the translator.

       $link->text()
	   This method returns the textual representation of the hyperlink as
	   above, but without markers (read only). Depending on the link type
	   this is one of the following alternatives (the + and * denote the
	   portions of the text that are marked up):

	     +perl+		       L<perl>
	     *$|* in +perlvar+	       L<perlvar/$|>
	     *OPTIONS* in +perldoc+    L<perldoc/"OPTIONS">
	     *DESCRIPTION*	       L<"DESCRIPTION">

       $link->warning()
	   After parsing, this method returns any warnings encountered during
	   the parsing process.

       $link->file()
       $link->line()
	   Just simple slots for storing information about the line and the
	   file the link was encountered in. Has to be filled in manually.

       $link->page()
	   This method sets or returns the POD page this link points to.

       $link->node()
	   As above, but the destination node text of the link.

       $link->alttext()
	   Sets or returns an alternative text specified in the link.

       $link->type()
	   The node type, either "section" or "item". As an unofficial type,
	   there is also "hyperlink", derived from e.g. "L<http://perl.com>"

       $link->link()
	   Returns the link as contents of "L<>". Reciprocal to parse().

   Pod::Cache
       Pod::Cache holds information about a set of POD documents, especially
       the nodes for hyperlinks.  The following methods are available:

       Pod::Cache->new()
	   Create a new cache object. This object can hold an arbitrary number
	   of POD documents of class Pod::Cache::Item.

       $cache->item()
	   Add a new item to the cache. Without arguments, this method returns
	   a list of all cache elements.

       $cache->find_page($name)
	   Look for a POD document named $name in the cache. Returns the
	   reference to the corresponding Pod::Cache::Item object or undef if
	   not found.

   Pod::Cache::Item
       Pod::Cache::Item holds information about individual POD documents, that
       can be grouped in a Pod::Cache object.  It is intended to hold
       information about the hyperlink nodes of POD documents.	The following
       methods are available:

       Pod::Cache::Item->new()
	   Create a new object.

       $cacheitem->page()
	   Set/retrieve the POD document name (e.g. "Pod::Parser").

       $cacheitem->description()
	   Set/retrieve the POD short description as found in the "=head1
	   NAME" section.

       $cacheitem->path()
	   Set/retrieve the POD file storage path.

       $cacheitem->file()
	   Set/retrieve the POD file name.

       $cacheitem->nodes()
	   Add a node (or a list of nodes) to the document's node list. Note
	   that the order is kept, i.e. start with the first node and end with
	   the last.  If no argument is given, the current list of nodes is
	   returned in the same order the nodes have been added.  A node can
	   be any scalar, but usually is a pair of node string and unique id
	   for the "find_node" method to work correctly.

       $cacheitem->find_node($name)
	   Look for a node or index entry named $name in the object.  Returns
	   the unique id of the node (i.e. the second element of the array
	   stored in the node array) or undef if not found.

       $cacheitem->idx()
	   Add an index entry (or a list of them) to the document's index
	   list. Note that the order is kept, i.e. start with the first node
	   and end with the last.  If no argument is given, the current list
	   of index entries is returned in the same order the entries have
	   been added.	An index entry can be any scalar, but usually is a
	   pair of string and unique id.
