CREATE COLLATION(7)	PostgreSQL 9.1.4 Documentation	   CREATE COLLATION(7)



NAME
       CREATE_COLLATION - define a new collation

SYNOPSIS
       CREATE COLLATION name (
	   [ LOCALE = locale, ]
	   [ LC_COLLATE = lc_collate, ]
	   [ LC_CTYPE = lc_ctype ]
       )
       CREATE COLLATION name FROM existing_collation

DESCRIPTION
       CREATE COLLATION defines a new collation using the specified operating
       system locale settings, or by copying an existing collation.

       To be able to create a collation, you must have CREATE privilege on the
       destination schema.

PARAMETERS
       name
	   The name of the collation. The collation name can be
	   schema-qualified. If it is not, the collation is defined in the
	   current schema. The collation name must be unique within that
	   schema. (The system catalogs can contain collations with the same
	   name for other encodings, but these are ignored if the database
	   encoding does not match.)

       locale
	   This is a shortcut for setting LC_COLLATE and LC_CTYPE at once. If
	   you specify this, you cannot specify either of those parameters.

       lc_collate
	   Use the specified operating system locale for the LC_COLLATE locale
	   category. The locale must be applicable to the current database
	   encoding. (See CREATE DATABASE (CREATE_DATABASE(7)) for the precise
	   rules.)

       lc_ctype
	   Use the specified operating system locale for the LC_CTYPE locale
	   category. The locale must be applicable to the current database
	   encoding. (See CREATE DATABASE (CREATE_DATABASE(7)) for the precise
	   rules.)

       existing_collation
	   The name of an existing collation to copy. The new collation will
	   have the same properties as the existing one, but it will be an
	   independent object.

NOTES
       Use DROP COLLATION to remove user-defined collations.

       See Section 22.2, "Collation Support", in the documentation for more
       information about collation support in PostgreSQL.

EXAMPLES
       To create a collation from the operating system locale fr_FR.utf8
       (assuming the current database encoding is UTF8):

	   CREATE COLLATION french (LOCALE = 'fr_FR.utf8');

       To create a collation from an existing collation:

	   CREATE COLLATION german FROM "de_DE";

       This can be convenient to be able to use operating-system-independent
       collation names in applications.

COMPATIBILITY
       There is a CREATE COLLATION statement in the SQL standard, but it is
       limited to copying an existing collation. The syntax to create a new
       collation is a PostgreSQL extension.
