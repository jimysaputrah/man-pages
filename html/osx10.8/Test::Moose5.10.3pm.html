NAME
       Test::Moose - Test functions for Moose specific features

SYNOPSIS
	 use Test::More plan =&gt 1;
	 use Test::Moose;

	 meta_ok($class_or_obj, "... Foo has a -&gtmeta");
	 does_ok($class_or_obj, $role, "... Foo does the Baz role");
	 has_attribute_ok($class_or_obj, $attr_name, "... Foo has the 'bar' attribute");

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides some useful test functions for Moose based
       classes. It is an experimental first release, so comments and
       suggestions are very welcome.

EXPORTED FUNCTIONS
       meta_ok ($class_or_object)
	   Tests if a class or object has a metaclass.

       does_ok ($class_or_object, $role, ?$message)
	   Tests if a class or object does a certain role, similar to what
	   "isa_ok" does for the "isa" method.

       has_attribute_ok($class_or_object, $attr_name, ?$message)
	   Tests if a class or object has a certain attribute, similar to what
	   "can_ok" does for the methods.

       with_immutable { CODE } @class_names
	   Runs CODE (which should contain normal tests) twice, and make each
	   class in @class_names immutable in between the two runs.

TODO
       Convert the Moose test suite to use this module.
       Here is a list of possible functions to write
	   immutability predicates
	   anon-class predicates
	   discovering original method from modified method
	   attribute metaclass predicates (attribute_isa?)
