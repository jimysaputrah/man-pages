NAME
       glBindTexture - bind a named texture to a texturing target


C SPECIFICATION
       void glBindTexture( GLenum target,
			   GLuint texture )


PARAMETERS
       target	Specifies  the	target to which the texture is bound.  Must be
		either GL_TEXTURE_1D, GL_TEXTURE_2D, or GL_TEXTURE_3D.

       texture	Specifies the name of a texture.

DESCRIPTION
       glBindTexture  lets  you  create  or  use  a  named  texture.   Calling
       glBindTexture with
       target  set  to GL_TEXTURE_1D, GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_3D and texture
       set to the name of the newtexture binds the texture name to the target.
       When a texture is bound to a target, the previous binding for that tar-
       get is automatically broken.

       Texture names are unsigned integers. The value zero is reserved to rep-
       resent  the default texture for each texture target.  Texture names and
       the corresponding texture contents are local to the shared display-list
       space  (see  glXCreateContext) of the current GL rendering context; two
       rendering contexts share texture names only if they also share  display
       lists.

       You may use glGenTextures to generate a set of new texture names.

       When  a	texture  is  first bound, it assumes the dimensionality of its
       target:	A texture first  bound	to  GL_TEXTURE_1D  becomes  one-dimen-
       sional,	and  a texture first bound to GL_TEXTURE_2D becomes two-dimen-
       sional, and a texture first bound to  GL_TEXTURE_3D  becomes  a	three-
       dimensional texture. The state of a one-dimensional texture immediately
       after it is first bound is equivalent  to  the  state  of  the  default
       GL_TEXTURE_1D  at GL initialization, and similarly for two-, and three-
       dimensional textures.

       While a texture is bound, GL operations on the target to  which	it  is
       bound  affect  the bound texture, and queries of the target to which it
       is bound return state from the bound texture. If texture mapping of the
       dimensionality of the target to which a texture is bound is active, the
       bound texture is used.  In effect, the texture targets  become  aliases
       for  the  textures  currently  bound to them, and the texture name zero
       refers to the default textures that were bound to them  at  initializa-
       tion.

       A  texture  binding  created  with glBindTexture remains active until a
       different texture is bound to the same target, or until the bound  tex-
       ture is deleted with glDeleteTextures.

       Once  created,  a  named  texture  may be re-bound to the target of the
       matching dimensionality as often as needed.  It is usually much	faster
       to  use	glBindTexture  to bind an existing named texture to one of the
       texture	targets  than  it  is  to  reload  the	texture  image	 using
       glTexImage1D,  glTexImage2D,  or  glTexImage3D.	For additional control
       over performance, use glPrioritizeTextures.

       glBindTexture is included in display lists.

NOTES
       glBindTexture is available only if the GL version is 1.1 or greater.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if target is not one of the allowable val-
       ues.

       GL_INVALID_OPERATION  is generated if texture has a dimensionality that
       doesn't match that of target.

       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if glBindTexture is executed  between
       the execution of glBegin and the corresponding execution of glEnd.
