NAME
       DROP_VIEW - remove a view

SYNOPSIS
       DROP VIEW [ IF EXISTS ] name [, ...] [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ]

DESCRIPTION
       DROP VIEW drops an existing view. To execute this command you must be
       the owner of the view.

PARAMETERS
       IF EXISTS
	   Do not throw an error if the view does not exist. A notice is
	   issued in this case.

       name
	   The name (optionally schema-qualified) of the view to remove.

       CASCADE
	   Automatically drop objects that depend on the view (such as other
	   views).

       RESTRICT
	   Refuse to drop the view if any objects depend on it. This is the
	   default.

EXAMPLES
       This command will remove the view called kinds:

	   DROP VIEW kinds;

COMPATIBILITY
       This command conforms to the SQL standard, except that the standard
       only allows one view to be dropped per command, and apart from the IF
       EXISTS option, which is a PostgreSQL extension.

SEE ALSO
       ALTER VIEW (ALTER_VIEW(7)), CREATE VIEW (CREATE_VIEW(7))
