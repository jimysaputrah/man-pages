NAME
       Parse::Eyapp::Driver - The LR parser

INTRODUCTION
       This class has the method "YYParse" implementing the LR generic parsing
       algorithm plus the methods that give support to the generated parser.

THE "YYParse" METHOD
       The "YYParse" methods implements the generic LR parsing algorithm.  It
       very much works "Parse::Yapp::YYParse" and as yacc/bison "yyparse".  It
       accepts almost the same arguments as "Class->new" (Being "Class" the
       name of the generated class).

       The parser uses two tables and a stack. The two tables are called the
       action table and the goto table.  The stack is used to keep track of
       the states visited.

       At each step the generated parser consults the "action" table and takes
       one decision: To shift to a new state consuming one token (and pushing
       the current state in the stack) or to reduce by some production rule.
       In the last case the parser pops from its stack as many states as
       symbols are on the right hand side of the production rule. Here is a
       Perl/C like pseudocode summarizing the activity of "YYParse":

	    1	my $parser = shift; # The parser object
	    2	push(@stack, $parser->{startstate});
	    3	$b = $parser->YYLexer(); # Get the first token
	    4	FOREVER: {
	    5	  $s = top(0);	# Get the state on top of the stack
	    6	  $a = $b;
	    7	  switch ($parser->action[$s->state][$a]) {
	    8	    case "shift t" :
	    9	      my $t;
	   10	      $t->{state} = t;
	   11	      $t->{attr}  = $a->{attr};
	   12	      push($t);
	   13	      $b = $parser->YYLexer(); # Call the lexical analyzer
	   14	      break;
	   15	    case "reduce A->alpha" :
	   16	      # Call the semantic action with the attributes of the rhs as args
	   17	      my $semantic  = $parser->Semantic{A ->alpha}; # The semantic action
	   18	      my $r;
	   19	      $r->{attr} = $semantic->($parser, top(|alpha|-1)->attr, ... , top(0)->attr);
	   20
	   21	      # Pop as many states as symbols on the rhs of A->alpha
	   22	      pop(|alpha|);
	   23
	   24	      # Goto next state
	   25	      $r->{state} = $parser->goto[top(0)][A];
	   26	      push($r);
	   27	      break;
	   28	    case "accept" : return (1);
	   29	    default : $parser->YYError("syntax error");
	   30	  }
	   31	  redo FOREVER;
	   32	}

       Here "|alpha|" stands for the length of "alpha". Function top(k)
       returns the state in position "k" from the top of the stack, i.e. the
       state at depth "k".  Function pop(k) extracts "k" states from the
       stack. The call "$state->attr" returns the attribute associated with
       $state. The call "$parser->Semantic{A ->alpha}" returns the semantic
       action associated with production "A ->alpha".

       Let us see a trace for the small grammar in
       "examples/debuggingtut/aSb.yp":

	 pl@nereida:~/LEyapp/examples$ /usr/local/bin/paste.pl aSb.yp aSb.output | head -5

	 ;						| 1:	S -> /* empty */
	 %%						| 2:	S -> 'a' S 'b'

       The tables in file "aSb.output" describe the actions and transitions to
       take:

	 pl@nereida:~/LEyapp/examples$ cat -n aSb.output
	    .  .........................................

	   57  Number of terminals     : 3
	   58  Number of non-terminals : 2
	   59  Number of states        : 6

       When executed with "yydebug" set and input "aabb"  we obtain the
       following output:

	 pl@nereida:~/LEyapp/examples/debuggingtut$ eyapp -b '' -o use_aSb.pl aSb
	 pl@nereida:~/LEyapp/examples/debuggingtut$ ./use_aSb.pl -d
	 Provide a statement like "a a b b" and press <CR><CTRL-D>: aabb
	 ----------------------------------------
	 In state 0:
	 Stack:[0]
	 Need token. Got >a<
	 Shift and go to state 2.
	 ----------------------------------------
	 In state 2:
	 Stack:[0,2]
	 Need token. Got >a<
	 Shift and go to state 2.
	 ----------------------------------------
	 In state 2:
	 Stack:[0,2,2]
	 Need token. Got >b<
	 Reduce using rule 1 (S --> /* empty */): S -> epsilon
	 Back to state 2, then go to state 4.
	 ----------------------------------------
	 In state 4:
	 Stack:[0,2,2,4]
	 Shift and go to state 5.
	 ----------------------------------------
	 In state 5:
	 Stack:[0,2,2,4,5]
	 Don't need token.
	 Reduce using rule 2 (S --> a S b): S -> a S b
	 Back to state 2, then go to state 4.
	 ----------------------------------------

       As a result of reducing by rule 2 the three last visited states are
       popped from the stack, and the stack becomes "[0,2]". But that means
       that we are now in state 2 seeing a "S".  If you look at the table
       above being in state 2 and seeing a "S" we go to state 4.

	 In state 4:
	 Stack:[0,2,4]
	 Need token. Got >b<
	 Shift and go to state 5.
	 ----------------------------------------
	 In state 5:
	 Stack:[0,2,4,5]
	 Don't need token.
	 Reduce using rule 2 (S --> a S b): S -> a S b
	 Back to state 0, then go to state 1.
	 ----------------------------------------
	 In state 1:
	 Stack:[0,1]
	 Need token. Got ><
	 Shift and go to state 3.
	 ----------------------------------------
	 In state 3:
	 Stack:[0,1,3]
	 Don't need token.
	 Accept.

METHODS IN THE GENERATED CLASS: "Parse::Eyapp::Driver" METHODS
       The class containing the parser generated by "Parse::Eyapp" inherits
       from "Parse::Eyapp::Driver". Therefore all the methods in
       "Parse::Eyapp::Driver"  are available in the generated class.

       This section describes the methods and objects belonging to the class
       generated either using eyapp or "Parse::Eyapp->new_grammar". In the
       incoming paragraphs we will assume that "Class" was the value selected
       for the "classname" argument when "Parse::Eyapp->new_grammar" was
       called.	Objects belonging to  "Class" are the actual parsers for the
       input grammar.

   Class->new
       The method "Class->new" returns a new LALR parser object.  Here "Class"
       stands for the name of the class containing the parser.	See an example
       of call:

	 my $parser = main->new(yyprefix => 'Parse::Eyapp::Node::',
				yylex	 => \&main::_Lexer,
				yyerror  => \&main::_Error,
				yydebug => 0x1F,
	 );

       The meaning of the arguments used in the example are as follows:

       - yyprefix
	   Used with %tree or %metatree.  When used, the type names of the
	   nodes of the syntax tree will be build prefixing the value
	   associated to "yyprefix" to the name of the production rule. The
	   name of the production rule is either explicitly given through a
	   %name directive or the concatenation of the left hand side of the
	   rule with the ordinal of the right hand side of the production.
	   See section "Compiling with eyapp and treereg" in Parse::Eyapp for
	   an example.

       - yylex
	   Reference to the lexical analyzer subroutine

       - yyerror
	   Reference to the error subroutine. The error subroutine receives as
	   first argument the reference to the "Class" parser object.  This
	   way it can take advantage of methods like "YYCurval" and YYExpect
	   (see below):

	     sub _Error {
	       my($token)=$_[0]->YYCurval;
	       my($what)= $token ? "input: '$token'" : "end of input";
	       my @expected = $_[0]->YYExpect();

	       local $" = ', ';
	       die "Syntax error near $what. Expected one of these tokens: @expected\n";
	     }

       - yydebug
	   Controls the level of debugging. Must be a number.

       The package produced from the grammar has several methods.

       The parser object has the following methods that work at parsing time
       exactly as in Parse::Yapp. These methods can be found in the module
       Parse::Eyapp::Driver.  Assume you have in $parser the reference to your
       parser object:

   $parser->YYAction
       Receives the name of a production and a subroutine reference
       implementing the new semantic action.  If no subroutine reference is
       set returns the reference to the current semantic action. See the
       tutorial Parse::Eyapp::defaultaction and the examples in the
       "examples/recycle/" directory

    $parser->YYAccept
       Works as yacc/bison "YYACCEPT".	The parser finishes returning the
       current semantic value to indicate success.

    $parser->YYAbort
       Works as yacc/bison "YYABORT".  The parser finishes returning "undef"
       to indicate failure.

   Parse::Eyapp::Driver::BeANode
       Is not a method.  Receives as input a "Class" name.  Introduces
       "Parse::Eyapp::Node" as an ancestor class of "Class". To work
       correctly, objects belonging to "Class" must be hashes with a
       "children" key whose value must be a reference to the array of
       children. The children must be also "Parse::Eyapp::Node" nodes.
       Actually you can circumvent this call by directly introducing
       "Parse::Eyapp::Node" in the ancestors of "Class":

		push @{$class."::ISA"}, "Parse::Eyapp::Node"

   $parser->YYBuildAST
       Sometimes the best time to decorate a node with some attributes is just
       after being built. In such cases the programmer can take manual control
       building the node with "YYBuildAST" to immediately proceed to decorate
       it.

       The following example from the file "lib/Simple/Types.eyp" in the
       tarball in "examples/typechecking/Simple-Types-XXX.tar.gz" illustrates
       the idea:

	Variable:
	    %name  VARARRAY
	    $ID ('[' binary ']') <%name INDEXSPEC +>
	      {
		my $self = shift;
		my $node =  $self->YYBuildAST(@_);
		$node->{line} = $ID->[1];
		return $node;
	      }

       Actually, the %tree directive is semantically equivalent to:

	 %default action { goto &Parse::Eyapp::Driver::YYBuildAST }

    $parser->YYBuildingTree
       Influences the semantic of list operators.  If true the action
       associated with "X+" will be to build a "Parse::Eyapp::Node" node with
       all the attributes of the elements in the list as children. This is the
       appropriate semantic when working under the %tree directive.  If set to
       false the semantic action will return an anonymous list with the
       attributes associated with the "X" in the plus list.  Same thing with
       the operators "*" and "?".

   $parser->YYBuildTS
       Similar to "$parser->YYBuildAST" but builds nodes for translation
       schemes.

   $parser->YYBypass
       Returns TRUE if running under the "%tree bypass" clause

   $parser->YYBypassrule
       Returns TRUE if the production being used for reduction was marked to
       be bypassed.

    $parser->YYCurtok
       Gives the current token

    $parser->YYCurval
       Gives the attribute associated with the current token

   $parser->YYDelegateaction
       Use it as "defaultaction" if you want to recycle your grammar.  It is
       equivalent to:

	 sub YYDelegateaction {
	   my $self = shift;

	   my $action = $self->YYName;

	   $self->$action(@_);
	 }

       For a full example illustrating how to use it, see files
       "examples/recycle/NoacInh.eyp" and
       "examples/recycle/icalcu_and_ipost.pl" in the Parse::Eyapp distribution

    $parser->YYEndOfInput
       True if the "pos()" of the input being scanned in "${$parser->input}"
       is at the end

    $parser->YYErrok
       Works as yacc/bison "yyerrok".  Modifies the error status so that
       subsequent error messages will be emitted.

    $parser->YYError
       Works as yacc/bison "YYERROR".  Pretends that a syntax error has been
       detected.

    $parser->YYExpect
       Returns the list of tokens the parser expected when the failure
       occurred

	pl@nereida:~/src/perl/YappWithDefaultAction/examples$ \
				   sed -ne '26,33p' Postfix.eyp
	sub _Error {
	  my($token)=$_[0]->YYCurval;
	  my($what)= $token ? "input: '$token'" : "end of input";
	  my @expected = $_[0]->YYExpect();

	  local $" = ', ';
	  die "Syntax error near $what. Expected one of these tokens: @expected\n";
	}

       See the tutorial Parse::Eyapp::datagenerationtut and the section TOKENS
       DEPENDING ON THE SYNTACTIC CONTEXT in the tutorial
       Parse::Eyapp::debuggingtut for more detailed examples of use of
       "YYExpect".

   $parser->YYFirstline
       First line of the input string describing the grammar

   $parser->YYGrammar
       Return the list of grammar items.  Each item is an anonymous list
       containing

       o The name of the production

       o The LHS of the production

       o An anonymous list containing the symbols in the RHS

       If it receives an index as argument returns the corresponding item The
       following debugger session explain its use:

	 pl@europa:~/LEyapp/examples/recycle$ perl -wd usepostfix.pl
	 main::(usepostfix.pl:5):	 my $parser = new Postfix();
	   DB<1> n
	 main::(usepostfix.pl:6):	 $parser->Run;
	   DB<1> x $parser->YYGrammar
	 0  ARRAY(0xde5e20)
	    0  '_SUPERSTART'
	    1  '$start'
	    2  ARRAY(0xc85e80)
	       0  'line'
	       1  '$end'
	    3  0
	 1  ARRAY(0xe2b6b0)
	    0  'line_1'
	    1  'line'
	    2  ARRAY(0xe3abc0)
	       0  'exp'
	    3  0
	 2  ARRAY(0xa05530)
	    0  'exp_2'
	    1  'exp'
	    2  ARRAY(0x75bdc0)
	       0  'NUM'
	    3  0

	    ...  etc, etc

       If an index is provided it returns the item for such number:

	   DB<2> x $parser->YYGrammar(10)
	 0  'exp_10'
	 1  'exp'
	 2  ARRAY(0xa05f80)
	    0  '('
	    1  'exp'
	    2  ')'
	 3  0

       You can also use a production name as argument:

	   DB<3> x $parser->YYGrammar('exp_7')
	 0  'exp_7'
	 1  'exp'
	 2  ARRAY(0xa05890)
	    0  'exp'
	    1  '*'
	    2  'exp'
	 3  0

   $parser->YYGetLRAction($state, $token)
       Returns the shift-reduce action for state $state and token $token. A
       positive number must be interpreted as a shift to the state with that
       number. A negative number "-m" indicates a reduction by production with
       index "m".  Returns "undef" if no action is defined for such
       combination "($state, $token)".

       See example "DynamicallyChangingTheParser.eyp" in the directory
       "examples/debuggintut" for an example of use.

   $parser->YYIssemantic
       Returns TRUE if the terminal is semantic. Semantics token can be
       declared using the directive "%semantic token". The opposite of a
       Semantic token is a Syntactic token. Syntactic tokens can be declared
       using the directive  "%syntactic token".

       When using the %tree directive all the nodes corresponding to syntactic
       tokens are pruned from the tree. Under this directive tokens in the
       text delimited by simple quotes (like '+') are, by default, considered
       syntactic tokens.

       When using the %metatree directive all the tokens are considered, by
       default, semantic tokens.  Thus, no nodes will be - by default- pruned
       when construction the code augmented tree. The exception are string
       tokens used as separators in the definition of lists,  like in "S <*
       ';'>". If you want the separating string token to appear include an
       explicit semantic declaration for it (example "%semantic token ';'").

   $parser->YYIndex
       Receives the name of production (right hand side).  Returns the index
       in the grammar of the production with such name.  When called in a list
       context and without a name return the hash containing the relation

		  production name => production index

       The following debugger session illustrates its use:

	 pl@europa:~/LEyapp/examples/recycle$ perl -wd usepostfix.pl
	 main::(usepostfix.pl:5):	 my $parser = new Postfix();
	 main::(usepostfix.pl:6):	 $parser->Run;
	 DB<1> x $parser->YYIndex
	 0  'line_1'
	 1  1
	 2  'exp_3'
	 3  3
	 4  'exp_6'
	 5  6
	 6  'exp_4'
	 7  4
	 8  'exp_10'
	 9  10
	 10  'exp_8'
	 11  8
	 12  'exp_5'
	 13  5
	 14  'exp_7'
	 15  7
	 16  'exp_2'
	 17  2
	 18  '_SUPERSTART'
	 19  0
	 20  'exp_9'
	 21  9

       We can specify a list of names:

	 DB<2> x $parser->YYIndex(qw{exp_4 exp_7})
	 0  4
	 1  7
	 DB<3> x $parser->YYIndex(qw{exp_4})
	 0  4

   $parser->YYInput
       Alias "input". If an argument is provided, sets the input for the
       parser object.  The argument is a string or a reference to a string.
       It returns a reference to the input string or "undef" if not set.

   $parser->YYIsterm
       Returns TRUE  if the symbol given as argument is a terminal. Example:

	 DB<0> x $self->YYIsterm('exp')
	0  ''
	 DB<1> x $self->YYIsterm('*')
	0  1

       An example of combined use of "YYRightside", "YYRuleindex", "YYLhs" and
       "YYIsterm" can be found "examples/Eyapp/Rule3.yp":

	nereida:~/src/perl/YappWithDefaultAction/examples> sed -n -e '4,22p' Rule3.yp | cat -n
	 1  sub build_node {
	 2    my $self = shift;
	 3    my @children = @_;
	 4    my @right = $self->YYRightside();
	 5    my $var = $self->YYLhs;
	 6    my $rule = $self->YYRuleindex();
	 7
	 8    for(my $i = 0; $i < @right; $i++) {
	 9	$_ = $right[$i];
	10	if ($self->YYIsterm($_)) {
	11	  $children[$i] = bless { token => $_, attr => $children[$i] },
	12					      __PACKAGE__.'::TERMINAL';
	13	}
	14    }
	15    bless {
	16	      children => \@children,
	17	      info => "$var -> @right"
	18	    }, __PACKAGE__."::${var}_$rule"
	19  }

       when executed an output similar to this is produced:

	2*3
	$VAR1 = bless( {
	  'info' => 'exp -> exp * exp',
	  'children' => [
	    bless( {
	      'info' => 'exp -> NUM',
	      'children' => [ bless( { 'attr' => '2', 'token' => 'NUM' }, 'Rule3::TERMINAL' ) ]
	    }, 'Rule3::exp_6' ),
	    bless( { 'attr' => '*', 'token' => '*' }, 'Rule3::TERMINAL' ),
	    bless( {
	      'info' => 'exp -> NUM',
	      'children' => [ bless( { 'attr' => '3', 'token' => 'NUM' }, 'Rule3::TERMINAL' )
	      ]
	    }, 'Rule3::exp_6' )
	  ]
	}, 'Rule3::exp_11' );

    $parser->YYLexer
       Returns a reference to the lexical analyzer

    $parser->YYLhs
       Returns the identifier of the left hand side of the current production
       (the one that is being used for reduction/reverse derivation. An
       example of use can be found in "examples/Eyapp/Lhs1.yp":

	 %defaultaction { print $_[0]->YYLhs,"\n" }

   $parser->YYMain
       Alias is also "main".

       Other than the package, it has as optional arguments the "prompt"
       (shown each time it ask for input), the name of the input file (if it
       wasn't specified in the command line using "--file filename") and also
       the input string.

       This method provides a default "main" for testing the generated parser.
       It parses the commandline searching for a number of options. See an
       example of use:

	 pl@nereida:~/LEyapp/examples/eyapplanguageref$ cat use_list2.pl
	 #!/usr/bin/env perl
	 use warnings;
	 use strict;
	 use List2;

	 unshift @ARGV, '--noslurp';
	 List2->new->main("Try input 'aacbb': ");
	 pl@nereida:~/LEyapp/examples/eyapplanguageref$ ./use_list2.pl --help
	 Available options:
	     --debug			sets yydebug on
	     --nodebug			sets yydebug off
	     --file filepath		read input from filepath
	     --commandinput string	read input from string
	     --tree			prints $tree->str
	     --notree			does not print $tree->str
	     --info			When printing $tree->str shows the value of TERMINALs
	     --help			shows this help
	     --slurp			read until EOF reached
	     --noslurp			read until CR is reached
	     --argfile			main() will take the input string from its @_
	     --noargfile		main() will not take the input string from its @_
	     --yaml			dumps YAML for $tree: YAML module must be installed
	     --margin=i 		controls the indentation of $tree->str (i.e. $Parse::Eyapp::Node::INDENT)

   $parser->YYName
       Returns the name of the current rule (The production whose reduction
       gave place to the execution of the current semantic action).

	 DB<12> x $self->YYName
	0  'exp_11'

   $parser->YYNames
       Return the list of production names. In a scalar context returns a
       reference to such list.

	 pl@europa:~/LEyapp/examples/recycle$ eyapp Postfix
	 pl@europa:~/LEyapp/examples/recycle$ perl -wd usepostfix.pl
	 main::(usepostfix.pl:5):	 my $parser = new Postfix();
	 main::(usepostfix.pl:6):	 $parser->Run;
	 DB<1> x $parser->YYNames
	 0  '_SUPERSTART'
	 1  'line_1'
	 2  'exp_2'
	 3  'exp_3'
	 4  'exp_4'
	 5  'exp_5'
	 6  'exp_6'
	 7  'exp_7'
	 8  'exp_8'
	 9  'exp_9'
	 10  'exp_10'

   $parser->YYNberr
       The current number of errors

   $parser->YYNextState();
       If called inside a semantic action, returns the state after the
       reduction by the current production.

       Provide a token if called from any other side:

	 $parser->YYNextState($token);

       It will return the state given by the action table for the state in the
       top of the stack and the given token.

       For an example, see the program "DynamicallyChangingTheParser.eyp" in
       the directory "examples/debuggintut/".

   $parser->YYPrefix
       Return and/or sets the "yyprefix" attribute. This a string that will be
       concatenated as a prefix to any "Parse::Eyapp::Node" nodes in the
       syntax tree.

    $parser->YYParse()
       It very much works "Parse::Yapp::YYParse" and as yacc/bison "yyparse".
       It accepts almost the same arguments as "Class->new" with the exception
       of "yyprefix" which can be used only with "new".

    $parser->YYRecovering
       Works as yacc/bison "YYRECOVERING".  Returns "TRUE" if the parser is
       recovering from a syntax error.

   $parser->YYRestoreLRAction('conflictname', $token)
       This method has been designed to solve shift-reduce and reduce-reduce
       conflicts at parsing-time using the postponed conflict strategy.  It
       has to be called inside the semantic action associated with the
       postponed conflict rule. The LALR table is changed so that the action
       in the presence of the token $token is restored the one before the last
       call to

	 $parser->YYSetReduce($token, $productionname )

       See the examples in "examples/debuggingtut/" in files
       "DynamicallyChangingTheParser2.eyp" and "Cplusplus.eyp".

   $parser->YYRHSLength($productionindex)
       Also:

	 $parser->YYRHSLength

       returns the length of the right hand side (the number of symbols) of
       $productionindex. The name of the production can be used instead of its
       index.  If no index or name is provided and the method is called inside
       a semantic action, the length of the current production is returned.

   $parser->YYRightside
       Also:

	 $parser->YYRightside($index)

       Returns an array of strings describing the right hand side of the rule.
       The name of the production can be given instead of $index. If no $index
       is provided and the method is called inside a semantic action the right
       hand side of the current production is returned.

   $parser->YYRuleindex
       To be called inside a semantic action.  Returns the index of the
       current production rule, counting the super rule as rule 0.

       To know the numbers have a look at  the ".output" file.	To get a
       ".output" file use the option "-v" of "eyapp" or the "outputfile"
       parameter when using method "new_grammar" (see the documentation for
       eyapp).

   $parser->YYRule
       Return the list of rules.  The following debugger session illustrates
       its use:

	 pl@europa:~/LEyapp/examples/recycle$ perl -wd usepostfix.pl
	 main::(usepostfix.pl:5):	 my $parser = new Postfix();
	 main::(usepostfix.pl:6):	 $parser->Run;
	 0  ARRAY(0xa068e0)
	    0  '$start'
	    1  2
	    2  undef
	 1  ARRAY(0xa06940)
	    0  'line'
	    1  1
	    2  CODE(0xc22360)
	       -> &Postfix::__ANON__[Postfix.eyp:10] in Postfix.eyp:227-10
	 ... etc, etc.

       Each item has three components: the LHS of the production, the number
       of symbols in the RHS and the CODE reference to the semantic action.

       If an index is specified as argument it returns the corresponding item:

	    DB<2> x $parser->YYRule(7)
	 0  'exp'
	 1  3
	 2  CODE(0xc1fce0)
	    -> &Postfix::__ANON__[Postfix.eyp:7] in Postfix.eyp:276-7

       To know to what production an item is associated we can use the
       "YYGrammar" method:

	    DB<3> x $parser->YYGrammar('exp_7')
	 0  'exp_7'
	 1  'exp'
	 2  ARRAY(0xa05290)
	    0  'exp'
	    1  '*'
	    2  'exp'
	 3  0

       We can also use the name of the rule to get the item:

	  DB<4> x $parser->YYRule('exp_7')
	 0  'exp'
	 1  3
	 2  CODE(0xc1fce0)
	    -> &Postfix::__ANON__[Postfix.eyp:7] in Postfix.eyp:276-7

   $parser->YYSetaction
       Receives a hash with keys the names of the production rules (right hand
       sides) and values the new semantic actions. Used to reuse a grammar
       without overwriting all the semantic actions.  See section Reusing
       Grammars by Dynamic Substitution of Semantic Actions in
       Parse::Eyapp::defaultactionsintro.

   $parser->YYSetLRAction($conflictstate, $token, $shiftreduceaction )
       It also accepts the syntax:

	 $parser->YYSetLRAction($conflictstate, [$token1, ... ], $shiftreduceaction )

       This method has been designed to solve shift-reduce and reduce-reduce
       conflicts at parsing-time (not at parser-generation time).

       The LR table is changed so that the action in state $conflictstate in
       the presence of the token $token will be given by $shiftreduceaction.
       The current shift-reduce action isn't saved.

       See an example in "Cplusplus2.eyp" in the directory
       "examples/debuggintut".

   $parser->YYSetReduce($token, $productionname )
       This method has been designed to solve shift-reduce and reduce-reduce
       conflicts at parsing-time using the postponed conflict strategy. See
       the corresponding section in Parse::Eyapp::debuggintut. It has to be
       called inside the semantic action associated with the postponed
       conflict rule "conflictname".  The LALR table is changed so that the
       action in the presence of the token $token will be to reduce by
       $productionname. The current shift-reduce action is saved to be
       restored using

	 $parser->YYRestoreLRAction('conflictname', $token)

       See the examples in "examples/debuggingtut/" in files

       o "DynamicallyChangingTheParser2.eyp"

       o "confusingsolveddynamic.eyp"

       o "Cplusplus.eyp".

   $parser->YYSetShift($token)
       Also:

	     $parser->YYSetShift([$token1, $token2, ... ])

       This method has been designed to solve shift-reduce at parsing-time
       using the postponed conflict strategy. See the corresponding section in
       Parse::Eyapp::debuggintut. It has to be called inside the semantic
       action associated with the postponed conflict rule "conflictname".  The
       LALR table is changed so that the action in the presence of the token
       $token will be to shift.

       See the examples in "examples/debuggingtut/" in files

       o "DebugDynamicResolution.eyp"

       o "DynamicallyChangingTheParser.eyp"

   $parser->YYSlurpFile
       alias:

	$parser->slurp_file($filename[,$prompt[,$mode]])

       Receives the name of the file, reads its contents and stores it in
       "$parser->input".

       If the file does not exists, it proceeds to read from "STDIN".  If a
       prompt was set with "$parser->YYPrompt", it will be shown.  The
       additional optional parameter $mode is used in such case to set $/. It
       can also be used as a class method.

   $parser->YYState
       "YYState" returns a reference to the list of states containing the
       LALR(1) tables: the action and GOTO tables.  Each state is an anonymous
       hash:

	 DB<4> x $parser->YYState(2)
	 0  HASH(0xfa7120)
	    'ACTIONS' => HASH(0xfa70f0) # token => state
		  ':' => '-7'
	    'DEFAULT' => '-6'

       A negative number means reduction using the corresponding production
       rule (opposite) number. The former example tells to reduce by rule 7
       when in state 2 and seeing token ':'. By default, the action when in
       state 2 is to reduce by rule number 6.

       There are three keys: ACTIONS, GOTOS and  DEFAULT

	 DB<7> x $parser->YYState(13)
	0  HASH(0xfa8b50)
	   'ACTIONS' => HASH(0xfa7530)
	      'VAR' => 17
	   'GOTOS' => HASH(0xfa8b20)
	      'type' => 19

       The GOTOS tables contains the DFA transition tables for the syntactic
       variables. The former example tells to move to state 19 when in state
       13 after seeing the syntactic variable "type" (i.e. if after reducing
       by a rule of "type" we are in state 13).

   $parser->YYTopState($length)
       If $length is zero or not provided it returns the state on top of the
       stack.  Otherwise, returns the state $length units deep in the stack.
