NAME
       README.freebsd - Perl version 5 on FreeBSD systems

DESCRIPTION
       This document describes various features of FreeBSD that will affect
       how Perl version 5 (hereafter just Perl) is compiled and/or runs.

   FreeBSD core dumps from readdir_r with ithreads
       When perl is configured to use ithreads, it will use re-entrant library
       calls in preference to non-re-entrant versions.	There is a bug in
       FreeBSD's "readdir_r" function in versions 4.5 and earlier that can
       cause a SEGV when reading large directories. A patch for FreeBSD libc
       is available (see http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=misc/30631
       ) which has been integrated into FreeBSD 4.6.

   $^X doesn't always contain a full path in FreeBSD
       perl 5.8.0 sets $^X where possible to a full path by asking the
       operating system. On FreeBSD the full path of the perl interpreter is
       found by reading the symlink /proc/curproc/file. There is a bug on
       FreeBSD, where the result of reading this symlink is can be wrong in
       certain circumstances (see
       http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=35703 ).  In these cases
       perl will fall back to the old behaviour of using C's argv[0] value for
       $^X.

   Perl will no longer be part of "base FreeBSD"
       Not as bad as it sounds--what this means is that Perl will no longer be
       part of the kernel build system of FreeBSD.  Perl will still very
       probably be part of the "default install", and in any case the latest
       version will be in the ports system.  The first FreeBSD version this
       change will affect is 5.0, all 4.n versions will keep the status quo.
