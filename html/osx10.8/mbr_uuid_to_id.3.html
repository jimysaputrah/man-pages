MBR_UID_TO_UUID(3)	 BSD Library Functions Manual	    MBR_UID_TO_UUID(3)

NAME
     mbr_uid_to_uuid, mbr_gid_to_uuid, mbr_uuid_to_id, mbr_sid_to_uuid,
     mbr_uuid_to_sid -- user and group identifier translation functions

SYNOPSIS
     #include <membership.h>

     int
     mbr_uid_to_uuid(uid_t id, uuid_t uu);

     int
     mbr_gid_to_uuid(gid_t id, uuid_t uu);

     int
     mbr_uuid_to_id(const uuid_t uu, uid_t *id, int *id_type);

     int
     mbr_sid_to_uuid(const nt_sid_t *sid, uuid_t uu);

     int
     mbr_uuid_to_sid(const uuid_t uu, nt_sid_t *sid);

     int
     mbr_sid_to_string(const nt_sid_t *sid, char *string);

     int
     mbr_string_to_sid(const char *string, nt_sid_t *sid);

DESCRIPTION
     Users and groups can be referred to in multiple ways.  In addition to the
     traditional uid and gid, every user or group can be referenced by a 128
     bit uuid.	Additionally, if the user or group is hosted on a PDC or
     Active Directory server, it will have a 128 bit or larger sid.

     These routines communicate with openditectoryd(8).

     mbr_uid_to_uuid() takes a uid and looks up the associated user account.
     It provides the the uuid for that user as an output parameter.  Note that
     this routine will succeed and return a fabricated uuid if the input user
     uid does not exist.  getpwuid() should be used to test for the existence
     of a uid.

     mbr_gid_to_uuid() similarly gets the uuid associated with a group.  Note
     that this routine will succeed and return a fabricated uuid if the input
     group gid does not exist.	getgrgid() should be used to test for the
     existence of a gid.

     mbr_uuid_to_id() takes a uuid that refers to a user or group and fetches
     the corresponding uid or gid.  id_type is set to ID_TYPE_UID or
     ID_TYPE_GID to indicate which type was found.  Note that mbr_uuid_to_id()
     always returns an id even if the uuid is not found.  This returned id is
     not persistant, but can be used to map back to the uuid during runtime.
     To determine if the uuid exists, the returned id can be used in a call to
     getpwuid(3) or getgrgid(3).

     mbr_sid_to_uuid() takes a sid and returns the associated uuid.

     mbr_uuid_to_sid() returns a sid for the associated uuid.

     Two additional utility functions are available to convert between sids
     and a string representation.  String representations may be required, for
     example, when text files or XML files are used to save sid values.

     mbr_sid_to_string() converts a sid into a string representation.  The
     string parameter must be a buffer of at least 194 characters.  The con-
     verted string is terminated with a nul character.

     mbr_string_to_sid() converts an external string representation into a
     sid.

RETURN VALUES
     These functions return 0 on success or one of the following error codes
     on failure:

     [EIO]		Communication with openditectoryd(8) failed.

     [ENOENT]		The mapping can not be performed.

     [EAUTH]		Communication with openditectoryd(8) failed due to an
			authentication error.

     [EINVAL]		Invalid arguments were provided.

     [ENOMEM]		Insufficient storage space is available.

     mbr_gid_to_uuid() and mbr_uid_to_uuid() return 0 (success), even if the
     user/group does not exist.
