NAME
       glShaderSource - Replaces the source code in a shader object

C SPECIFICATION
       void glShaderSource(GLuint shader, GLsizei count,
			   const GLchar **string, const GLint *length);

PARAMETERS
       shader
	   Specifies the handle of the shader object whose source code is to
	   be replaced.

       count
	   Specifies the number of elements in the string and length arrays.

       string
	   Specifies an array of pointers to strings containing the source
	   code to be loaded into the shader.

       length
	   Specifies an array of string lengths.

DESCRIPTION
       glShaderSource sets the source code in shader to the source code in the
       array of strings specified by string. Any source code previously stored
       in the shader object is completely replaced. The number of strings in
       the array is specified by count. If length is NULL, each string is
       assumed to be null terminated. If length is a value other than NULL, it
       points to an array containing a string length for each of the
       corresponding elements of string. Each element in the length array may
       contain the length of the corresponding string (the null character is
       not counted as part of the string length) or a value less than 0 to
       indicate that the string is null terminated. The source code strings
       are not scanned or parsed at this time; they are simply copied into the
       specified shader object.

NOTES
       OpenGL copies the shader source code strings when glShaderSource is
       called, so an application may free its copy of the source code strings
       immediately after the function returns.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if shader is not a value generated by
       OpenGL.

       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if shader is not a shader object.

       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if count is less than 0.

ASSOCIATED GETS
       glGetShader() with arguments shader and GL_SHADER_SOURCE_LENGTH

       glGetShaderSource() with argument shader

       glIsShader()
