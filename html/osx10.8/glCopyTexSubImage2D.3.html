NAME
       glCopyTexSubImage2D - copy a two-dimensional texture subimage


C SPECIFICATION
       void glCopyTexSubImage2D( GLenum target,
				 GLint level,
				 GLint xoffset,
				 GLint yoffset,
				 GLint x,
				 GLint y,
				 GLsizei width,
				 GLsizei height )


PARAMETERS
       target	Specifies the target texture.  Must be GL_TEXTURE_2D.

       level	Specifies  the	level-of-detail  number.   Level 0 is the base
		image level.  Level n is the nth mipmap reduction image.

       xoffset	Specifies a texel offset in the x direction within the texture
		array.

       yoffset	Specifies a texel offset in the y direction within the texture
		array.

       x, y	Specify the window coordinates of the lower left corner of the
		rectangular region of pixels to be copied.

       width	Specifies the width of the texture subimage.

       height	Specifies the height of the texture subimage.

DESCRIPTION
       glCopyTexSubImage2D replaces a rectangular portion of a two-dimensional
       texture image with pixels from the current GL_READ_BUFFER (rather  than
       from main memory, as is the case for glTexSubImage2D).

       The screen-aligned pixel rectangle with lower left corner at (x, y) and
       with width width and height height replaces the portion of the  texture
       array with x indices xoffset through xoffset + width -1, inclusive, and
       y indices yoffset through yoffset+height-1, inclusive,  at  the	mipmap
       level specified by level.

       The  pixels  in	the rectangle are processed exactly as if glCopyPixels
       had been called, but the process stops just  before  final  conversion.
       At  this  point,  all  pixel  component values are clamped to the range
       [0, 1] and then converted to the texture's internal  for storage in the
       texel array.

       The destination rectangle in the texture array may not include any tex-
       els outside the texture array as it was originally  specified.	It  is
       not  an	error  to  specify a subtexture with zero width or height, but
       such a specification has no effect.

       If any of the pixels within the	specified  rectangle  of  the  current
       GL_READ_BUFFER  are outside the read window associated with the current
       rendering context, then the values obtained for those pixels are  unde-
       fined.

       No  change  is  made  to  the  internalformat, width, height, or border
       parameters of the specified texture array or to	texel  values  outside
       the specified subregion.

NOTES
       glCopyTexSubImage2D  is	available  only  if  the  GL version is 1.1 or
       greater.

       Texturing has no effect in color index mode.

       glPixelStore and glPixelTransfer modes affect texture images in exactly
       the way they affect glDrawPixels.

       When  the  GL_ARB_imaging  extension  is supported, the RGBA components
       read from the framebuffer may be processed  by  the  imaging  pipeline.
       See glTexImage1D for specific details.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if target is not GL_TEXTURE_2D.

       GL_INVALID_OPERATION  is  generated  if	the texture array has not been
       defined by a previous glTexImage2D or glCopyTexImage2D operation.

       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if level is less than 0.

       GL_INVALID_VALUE may be generated if level is greater  than  log2(max),
       where max is the returned value of GL_MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE.

       GL_INVALID_VALUE  is  generated	if x < -b or if y < -b, where b is the
       border width of the texture array.

       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if xoffset < -b, (xoffset + width) >(w  -
       b),  yoffset  <	-b,  or  (yoffset+height)  >  (h  -b),	where w is the
       GL_TEXTURE_WIDTH,  h  is  the   GL_TEXTURE_HEIGHT,   and   b   is   the
       GL_TEXTURE_BORDER of the texture image being modified.  Note that w and
       h include twice the border width.

       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if  glCopyTexSubImage2D  is  executed
       between	the  execution	of  glBegin and the corresponding execution of
       glEnd.
