DESCRIPTION
       Texturing maps a portion of a specified texture image onto each graphi-
       cal  primitive  for  which texturing is enabled.  To enable and disable
       three-dimensional texturing, call glEnable and glDisable with  argument
       GL_TEXTURE_3D.

       To  define  texture  images, call glTexImage3D.	The arguments describe
       the parameters of the texture image,  such  as  height,	width,	depth,
       width  of  the border, level-of-detail number (see glTexParameter), and
       number of color components provided.  The last three arguments describe
       how the image is represented in memory; they are identical to the pixel
       formats used for glDrawPixels.

       If target is GL_PROXY_TEXTURE_3D, no data is read from pixels, but  all
       of  the	texture  image state is recalculated, checked for consistency,
       and checked against the implementation's capabilities. If the implemen-
       tation  cannot  handle a texture of the requested texture size, it sets
       all of the image state to 0,  but  does	not  generate  an  error  (see
       glGetError).  To  query	for an entire mipmap array, use an image array
       level greater than or equal to 1.

       If target is GL_TEXTURE_3D, data is read from pixels as a  sequence  of
       signed  or unsigned bytes, shorts, or longs, or single-precision float-
       ing-point values, depending on type.  These  values  are  grouped  into
       sets  of  one, two, three, or four values, depending on format, to form
       elements.  If type is GL_BITMAP, the data is considered as a string  of
       unsigned  bytes (and format must be GL_COLOR_INDEX).  Each data byte is
       treated as eight  1-bit	elements,  with  bit  ordering	determined  by
       GL_UNPACK_LSB_FIRST (see glPixelStore).

       The  first  element corresponds to the lower left corner of the texture
       image.  Subsequent elements progress left-to-right through the  remain-
       ing  texels in the lowest row of the texture image, and then in succes-
       sively higher rows of the texture image.  The final element corresponds
       to the upper right corner of the texture image.

       format  determines  the	composition of each element in pixels.	It can
       assume one of eleven symbolic values:

       GL_COLOR_INDEX
		 Each element is a single value, a color index.  The  GL  con-
		 verts	it  to fixed point (with an unspecified number of zero
		 bits to the right of the binary point), shifted left or right
		 depending  on the value and sign of GL_INDEX_SHIFT, and added
		 to GL_INDEX_OFFSET (see
		 glPixelTransfer).  The resulting index is converted to a  set
		 of    color   components   using   the   GL_PIXEL_MAP_I_TO_R,
		 GL_PIXEL_MAP_I_TO_G,	      GL_PIXEL_MAP_I_TO_B,	   and
		 GL_PIXEL_MAP_I_TO_A tables, and clamped to the range [0,1].

       GL_RED	 Each  element	is a single red component.  The GL converts it
		 to floating point and assembles it into an  RGBA  element  by
		 attaching 0 for green and blue, and 1 for alpha.  Each compo-
		 nent  is  then  multiplied  by  the   signed	scale	factor
		 GL_c_SCALE,  added  to the signed bias GL_c_BIAS, and clamped
		 to the range [0,1] (see glPixelTransfer).

       GL_GREEN  Each element is a single green component.  The GL converts it
		 to  floating  point  and assembles it into an RGBA element by
		 attaching 0 for red and blue, and 1 for alpha.   Each	compo-
		 nent	is   then   multiplied	by  the  signed  scale	factor
		 GL_c_SCALE, added to the signed bias GL_c_BIAS,  and  clamped
		 to the range [0,1] (see glPixelTransfer).

       GL_BLUE	 Each  element is a single blue component.  The GL converts it
		 to floating point and assembles it into an  RGBA  element  by
		 attaching  0 for red and green, and 1 for alpha.  Each compo-
		 nent  is  then  multiplied  by  the   signed	scale	factor
		 GL_c_SCALE,  added  to the signed bias GL_c_BIAS, and clamped
		 to the range [0,1] (see glPixelTransfer).

       GL_ALPHA  Each element is a single alpha component.  The GL converts it
		 to  floating  point  and assembles it into an RGBA element by
		 attaching 0 for red, green, and blue.	Each component is then
		 multiplied  by  the  signed scale factor GL_c_SCALE, added to
		 the signed bias GL_c_BIAS, and clamped  to  the  range  [0,1]
		 (see glPixelTransfer).

       GL_RGB

       GL_BGR	 Each  element is an RGB triple.  The GL converts it to float-
		 ing point and assembles it into an RGBA element by  attaching
		 1 for alpha.  Each component is then multiplied by the signed
		 scale factor GL_c_SCALE, added to the signed bias  GL_c_BIAS,
		 and clamped to the range [0,1] (see
		 glPixelTransfer).

       GL_RGBA

       GL_BGRA	 Each element contains all four components.  Each component is
		 multiplied by the signed scale factor	GL_c_SCALE,  added  to
		 the  signed  bias  GL_c_BIAS,	and clamped to the range [0,1]
		 (see glPixelTransfer).

       GL_LUMINANCE
		 Each element is a single luminance value.  The GL converts it
		 to  floating point, then assembles it into an RGBA element by
		 replicating the luminance value three times for  red,	green,
		 and  blue  and attaching 1 for alpha.	Each component is then
		 multiplied by the signed scale factor	GL_c_SCALE,  added  to
		 the  signed  bias  GL_c_BIAS,	and clamped to the range [0,1]
		 (see glPixelTransfer).

       GL_LUMINANCE_ALPHA
		 Each element is a luminance/alpha pair.  The GL  converts  it
		 to  floating point, then assembles it into an RGBA element by
		 replicating the luminance value three times for  red,	green,
		 and  blue.   Each  component is then multiplied by the signed
		 scale factor GL_c_SCALE, added to the signed bias  GL_c_BIAS,
		 and clamped to the range [0,1] (see
		 glPixelTransfer).

       Refer  to  the  glDrawPixels  reference	page  for a description of the
       acceptable values for the type parameter.

       If an application wants to store the texture at a certain resolution or
       in  a certain , it can request the resolution and  with internalformat.
       The GL will choose an internal representation that closely approximates
       that  requested	by internalformat, but it may not match exactly.  (The
       representations specified by GL_LUMINANCE, GL_LUMINANCE_ALPHA,  GL_RGB,
       and  GL_RGBA  must match exactly. The numeric values 1, 2, 3, and 4 may
       also be used to specify the above representations.)

       Use the GL_PROXY_TEXTURE_3D target to try out a resolution  and	update
       and recompute its best match for the requested storage resolution and .
       To then query this state, call glGetTexLevelParameter.  If the  texture
       cannot be accommodated, texture state is set to 0.

       A  one-component  texture image uses only the red component of the RGBA
       color extracted from pixels.  A two-component image uses the  R	and  A
       values.	 A three-component image uses the R, G, and B values.  A four-
       component image uses all of the RGBA components.

NOTES
       Texturing has no effect in color index mode.

       The texture image can be represented by the same data  formats  as  the
       pixels  in  a  glDrawPixels  command,  except that GL_STENCIL_INDEX and
       GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT cannot be used.   glPixelStore  and  glPixelTransfer
       modes   affect	texture   images   in  exactly	the  way  they	affect
       glDrawPixels.


       glTexImage3D is available only if the GL version is 1.2 or greater.

       Internal formats other than 1, 2, 3, or 4 may be used only  if  the  GL
       version is 1.1 or greater.

       pixels may be a null pointer.  In this case texture memory is allocated
       to accommodate a texture of  width  width,  height  height,  and  depth
       depth.	You  can  then download subtextures to initialize this texture
       memory.	The image is undefined if the user tries to  apply  an	unini-
       tialized portion of the texture image to a primitive.

       Formats	 GL_BGR,   and	 GL_BGRA   and	types  GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE_3_3_2,
       GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE_2_3_3_REV,		      GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT_5_6_5,
       GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT_5_6_5_REV,		    GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT_4_4_4_4,
       GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT_4_4_4_4_REV,		    GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT_5_5_5_1,
       GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT_1_5_5_5_REV,		      GL_UNSIGNED_INT_8_8_8_8,
       GL_UNSIGNED_INT_8_8_8_8_REV,	 GL_UNSIGNED_INT_10_10_10_2,	   and
       GL_UNSIGNED_INT_2_10_10_10_REV  are available only if the GL version is
       1.2 or greater.

       When the GL_ARB_multitexture extension is supported, glTexImage3D spec-
       ifies the three-dimensional texture for the current texture unit, spec-
       ified with glActiveTextureARB.

       If the GL_ARB_imaging extension is supported, RGBA elements may also be
       processed by the imaging pipeline.  The following stages may be applied
       to an RGBA color before color component clamping to the range [0, 1]:

       1. Color component replacement by the color table specified for
	  GL_COLOR_TABLE, if enabled. See glColorTable.

       2. Color component replacement by the color table specified for
	  GL_POST_CONVOLUTION_COLOR_TABLE, if enabled.	See glColorTable.

       3. Transformation by the color matrix.  See glMatrixMode.

       4. RGBA components may be multiplied by GL_POST_COLOR_MATRIX_c_SCALE,
	  and  added  to   GL_POST_COLOR_MATRIX_c_BIAS,   if   enabled.    See
	  glPixelTransfer.

       5. Color component replacement by the color table specified for
	  GL_POST_COLOR_MATRIX_COLOR_TABLE, if enabled.  See glColorTable.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_ENUM	 is  generated	if  target  is	not  GL_TEXTURE_3D  or
       GL_PROXY_TEXTURE_3D.

       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if format is not an accepted
	constant.   Format   constants	 other	 than	GL_STENCIL_INDEX   and
       GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT are accepted.

       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if type is not a type constant.

       GL_INVALID_ENUM	is  generated  if  type is GL_BITMAP and format is not
       GL_COLOR_INDEX.

       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if level is less than 0.


       GL_INVALID_VALUE may be generated if level is greater  than  log2(max),
       where max is the returned value of GL_MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE.

       GL_INVALID_VALUE  is  generated if internalformat is not 1, 2, 3, 4, or
       one of the accepted resolution and  symbolic constants.

       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if width, height, or depth is less than 0
       or  greater than 2 + GL_MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE, or if either cannot be repre-
       sented as 2^k +2 (border) for some integer value of k.

       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if border is not 0 or 1.

       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if glTexImage3D is  executed  between
       the execution of glBegin and the corresponding execution of glEnd.

       GL_INVALID_OPERATION    is    generated	  if	type	is    one   of
       GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE_3_3_2,			   GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE_2_3_3_REV,
       GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT_5_6_5,  or  GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT_5_6_5_REV and format is
       not GL_RGB.

       GL_INVALID_OPERATION   is    generated	 if    type    is    one    of
       GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT_4_4_4_4,		GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT_4_4_4_4_REV,
       GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT_5_5_5_1,		GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT_1_5_5_5_REV,
