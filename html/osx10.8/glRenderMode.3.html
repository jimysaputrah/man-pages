NAME
       glRenderMode - set rasterization mode


C SPECIFICATION
       GLint glRenderMode( GLenum mode )


PARAMETERS
       mode  Specifies	the  rasterization  mode.   Three values are accepted:
	     GL_RENDER, GL_SELECT, and	GL_FEEDBACK.   The  initial  value  is
	     GL_RENDER.

DESCRIPTION
       glRenderMode sets the rasterization mode.  It takes one argument, mode,
       which can assume one of three predefined values:

       GL_RENDER       Render mode. Primitives are rasterized, producing pixel
		       fragments,  which  are  written	into the frame buffer.
		       This is the normal mode and also the default mode.

       GL_SELECT       Selection mode.	No pixel fragments are	produced,  and
		       no  change  to  the  frame  buffer  contents  is  made.
		       Instead, a record of the names of primitives that would
		       have  been  drawn if the render mode had been GL_RENDER
		       is returned in a select buffer, which must  be  created
		       (see  glSelectBuffer) before selection mode is entered.

       GL_FEEDBACK     Feedback mode.  No pixel fragments are produced, and no
		       change  to the frame buffer contents is made.  Instead,
		       the coordinates and attributes of vertices  that  would
		       have  been  drawn if the render mode had been GL_RENDER
		       is returned in a feedback buffer, which must be created
		       (see glFeedbackBuffer) before feedback mode is entered.

       The return value of glRenderMode is determined by the  render  mode  at
       the  time  glRenderMode	is  called,  rather  than by mode.  The values
       returned for the three render modes are as follows:

       GL_RENDER       0.

       GL_SELECT       The number of hit records  transferred  to  the	select
		       buffer.

       GL_FEEDBACK     The  number of values (not vertices) transferred to the
		       feedback buffer.

       See the glSelectBuffer and glFeedbackBuffer reference  pages  for  more
       details concerning selection and feedback operation.

NOTES
       If an error is generated, glRenderMode returns 0 regardless of the cur-
       rent render mode.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if mode is not one of the  three  accepted
       values.

       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if glSelectBuffer is called while the
       render mode is GL_SELECT, or if glRenderMode is	called	with  argument
       GL_SELECT before glSelectBuffer is called at least once.

       GL_INVALID_OPERATION  is  generated if glFeedbackBuffer is called while
       the render mode is GL_FEEDBACK, or if glRenderMode is called with argu-
       ment GL_FEEDBACK before glFeedbackBuffer is called at least once.

       GL_INVALID_OPERATION  is  generated if glRenderMode is executed between
       the execution of glBegin and the corresponding execution of glEnd.

ASSOCIATED GETS
       glGet with argument GL_RENDER_MODE
