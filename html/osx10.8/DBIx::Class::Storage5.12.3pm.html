NAME
       DBIx::Class::Storage - Generic Storage Handler

DESCRIPTION
       A base implementation of common Storage methods.  For specific
       information about DBI-based storage, see DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI.

METHODS
   new
       Arguments: $schema

       Instantiates the Storage object.

   set_schema
       Used to reset the schema class or object which owns this storage
       object, such as during "clone" in DBIx::Class::Schema.

   connected
       Returns true if we have an open storage connection, false if it is not
       (yet) open.

   disconnect
       Closes any open storage connection unconditionally.

   ensure_connected
       Initiate a connection to the storage if one isn't already open.

   throw_exception
       Throws an exception - croaks.

   txn_do
       Arguments: $coderef, @coderef_args?
       Return Value: The return value of $coderef

       Executes $coderef with (optional) arguments @coderef_args atomically,
       returning its result (if any). If an exception is caught, a rollback is
       issued and the exception is rethrown. If the rollback fails, (i.e.
       throws an exception) an exception is thrown that includes a "Rollback
       failed" message.

       For example,

	 my $author_rs = $schema->resultset('Author')->find(1);
	 my @titles = qw/Night Day It/;

	 my $coderef = sub {
	   # If any one of these fails, the entire transaction fails
	   $author_rs->create_related('books', {
	     title => $_
	   }) foreach (@titles);

	   return $author->books;
	 };

	 my $rs;
	 try {
	   $rs = $schema->txn_do($coderef);
	 } catch {
	   my $error = shift;
	   # Transaction failed
	   die "something terrible has happened!"
	     if ($error =~ /Rollback failed/);		# Rollback failed

	   deal_with_failed_transaction();
	 };

       In a nested transaction (calling txn_do() from within a txn_do()
       coderef) only the outermost transaction will issue a "txn_commit", and
       txn_do() can be called in void, scalar and list context and it will
       behave as expected.

       Please note that all of the code in your coderef, including
       non-DBIx::Class code, is part of a transaction.	This transaction may
       fail out halfway, or it may get partially double-executed (in the case
       that our DB connection failed halfway through the transaction, in which
       case we reconnect and restart the txn).	Therefore it is best that any
       side-effects in your coderef are idempotent (that is, can be re-
       executed multiple times and get the same result), and that you check up
       on your side-effects in the case of transaction failure.

   txn_begin
       Starts a transaction.

       See the preferred "txn_do" method, which allows for an entire code
       block to be executed transactionally.

   txn_commit
       Issues a commit of the current transaction.

       It does not perform an actual storage commit unless there's a
       DBIx::Class transaction currently in effect (i.e. you called
       "txn_begin").

   txn_rollback
       Issues a rollback of the current transaction. A nested rollback will
       throw a DBIx::Class::Storage::NESTED_ROLLBACK_EXCEPTION exception,
       which allows the rollback to propagate to the outermost transaction.

   svp_begin
       Arguments: $savepoint_name?

       Created a new savepoint using the name provided as argument. If no name
       is provided, a random name will be used.

   svp_release
       Arguments: $savepoint_name?

       Release the savepoint provided as argument. If none is provided,
       release the savepoint created most recently. This will implicitly
       release all savepoints created after the one explicitly released as
       well.

   svp_rollback
       Arguments: $savepoint_name?

       Rollback to the savepoint provided as argument. If none is provided,
       rollback to the savepoint created most recently. This will implicitly
       release all savepoints created after the savepoint we rollback to.

   txn_scope_guard
       An alternative way of transaction handling based on
       DBIx::Class::Storage::TxnScopeGuard:

	my $txn_guard = $storage->txn_scope_guard;

	$row->col1("val1");
	$row->update;

	$txn_guard->commit;

       If an exception occurs, or the guard object otherwise leaves the scope
       before "$txn_guard->commit" is called, the transaction will be rolled
       back by an explicit "txn_rollback" call. In essence this is akin to
       using a "txn_begin"/"txn_commit" pair, without having to worry about
       calling "txn_rollback" at the right places. Note that since there is no
       defined code closure, there will be no retries and other magic upon
       database disconnection. If you need such functionality see "txn_do".

   sql_maker
       Returns a "sql_maker" object - normally an object of class
       "DBIx::Class::SQLMaker".

   debug
       Causes trace information to be emitted on the "debugobj" object.  (or
       "STDERR" if "debugobj" has not specifically been set).

       This is the equivalent to setting "DBIC_TRACE" in your shell
       environment.

   debugfh
       Set or retrieve the filehandle used for trace/debug output.  This
       should be an IO::Handle compatible object (only the "print" method is
       used.  Initially set to be STDERR - although see information on the
       DBIC_TRACE environment variable.

   debugobj
       Sets or retrieves the object used for metric collection. Defaults to an
       instance of DBIx::Class::Storage::Statistics that is compatible with
       the original method of using a coderef as a callback.  See the
       aforementioned Statistics class for more information.

   debugcb
       Sets a callback to be executed each time a statement is run; takes a
       sub reference.  Callback is executed as $sub->($op, $info) where $op is
       SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE and $info is what would normally be
       printed.

       See "debugobj" for a better way.

   cursor_class
       The cursor class for this Storage object.

   deploy
       Deploy the tables to storage (CREATE TABLE and friends in a SQL-based
       Storage class). This would normally be called through "deploy" in
       DBIx::Class::Schema.

   connect_info
       The arguments of "connect_info" are always a single array reference,
       and are Storage-handler specific.

       This is normally accessed via "connection" in DBIx::Class::Schema,
       which encapsulates its argument list in an arrayref before calling
       "connect_info" here.

   select
       Handle a select statement.

   insert
       Handle an insert statement.

   update
       Handle an update statement.

   delete
       Handle a delete statement.

   select_single
       Performs a select, fetch and return of data - handles a single row
       only.

   columns_info_for
       Returns metadata for the given source's columns.  This is *deprecated*,
       and will be removed before 1.0.	You should be specifying the metadata
       yourself if you need it.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
   DBIC_TRACE
       If "DBIC_TRACE" is set then trace information is produced (as when the
       "debug" method is set).

       If the value is of the form "1=/path/name" then the trace output is
       written to the file "/path/name".

       This environment variable is checked when the storage object is first
       created (when you call connect on your schema).	So, run-time changes
       to this environment variable will not take effect unless you also re-
       connect on your schema.

   DBIC_TRACE_PROFILE
       If "DBIC_TRACE_PROFILE" is set, DBIx::Class::Storage::PrettyPrint will
       be used to format the output from "DBIC_TRACE".	The value it is set to
       is the "profile" that it will be used.  If the value is a filename the
       file is read with Config::Any and the results are used as the
       configuration for tracing.  See "new" in SQL::Abstract::Tree for what
       that structure should look like.

   DBIX_CLASS_STORAGE_DBI_DEBUG
       Old name for DBIC_TRACE
