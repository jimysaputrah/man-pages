NAME
       PPI::Statement::Variable - Variable declaration statements

SYNOPSIS
	 # All of the following are variable declarations
	 my $foo = 1;
	 my ($foo, $bar) = (1, 2);
	 our $foo = 1;
	 local $foo;
	 local $foo = 1;
	 LABEL: my $foo = 1;

INHERITANCE
	 PPI::Statement::Variable
	 isa PPI::Statement::Expression
	     isa PPI::Statement
		 isa PPI::Node
		     isa PPI::Element

DESCRIPTION
       The main intent of the "PPI::Statement::Variable" class is to describe
       simple statements that explicitly declare new local or global
       variables.

       Note that this does not make it exclusively the only place where
       variables are defined, and later on you should expect that the
       "variables" method will migrate deeper down the tree to either
       PPI::Statement or PPI::Node to recognise this fact, but for now it
       stays here.

METHODS
   type
       The "type" method checks and returns the declaration type of the
       statement, which will be one of 'my', 'local', 'our', or 'state'.

       Returns a string of the type, or "undef" if the type cannot be detected
       (which is probably a bug).

   variables
       As for several other PDOM Element types that can declare variables, the
       "variables" method returns a list of the canonical forms of the
       variables defined by the statement.

       Returns a list of the canonical string forms of variables, or the null
       list if it is unable to find any variables.

   symbols
       Returns a list of the variables defined by the statement, as
       PPI::Token::Symbols.

TO DO
