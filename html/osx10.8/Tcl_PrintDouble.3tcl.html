NAME
       Tcl_PrintDouble - Convert floating value to string

SYNOPSIS
       #include <tcl.h>

       Tcl_PrintDouble(interp, value, dst)

ARGUMENTS
       Tcl_Interp *interp (in)		Before	 Tcl  8.0,  the  tcl_precision
					variable  in  this  interpreter   con-
					trolled  the  conversion.   As	of Tcl
					8.0, this argument is ignored and  the
					conversion   is   controlled   by  the
					tcl_precision  variable  that  is  now
					shared by all interpreters.

       double value (in)		Floating-point	value to be converted.

       char *dst (out)			Where to store the string representing
					value.	 Must  have  at least TCL_DOU-
					BLE_SPACE characters of storage.

DESCRIPTION
       Tcl_PrintDouble generates a string that represents the value  of  value
       and  stores it in memory at the location given by dst.  It uses %g for-
       mat to generate the string, with one special twist: the string is guar-
       anteed to contain either a "."  or an "e" so that it does not look like
       an integer.  Where %g would generate an integer with no decimal	point,
       Tcl_PrintDouble adds ".0".					       |

       If  the tcl_precision value is non-zero, the result will have precisely |
       that many digits of significance.  If the value is zero (the  default), |
       the  result  will have the fewest digits needed to represent the number |
       in such a way that Tcl_NewDoubleObj will generate the same number  when |
       presented  with	the  given string.  IEEE semantics of rounding to even |
       apply to the conversion.
