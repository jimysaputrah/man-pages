NAME
       pcap_activate - activate a capture handle

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pcap/pcap.h>

       int pcap_activate(pcap_t *p);

DESCRIPTION
       pcap_activate()	is used to activate a packet capture handle to look at
       packets on the network, with the options that were set  on  the	handle
       being in effect.

RETURN VALUE
       pcap_activate()	returns  0  on	success  without  warnings, PCAP_WARN-
       ING_PROMISC_NOTSUP on success on a device that doesn't support  promis-
       cuous  mode  if promiscuous mode was requested, PCAP_WARNING on success
       with any other warning, PCAP_ERROR_ACTIVATED if the handle has  already
       been  activated, PCAP_ERROR_NO_SUCH_DEVICE if the capture source speci-
       fied when the handle was created doesn't exist,	PCAP_ERROR_PERM_DENIED
       if  the	process  doesn't  have	permission to open the capture source,
       PCAP_ERROR_RFMON_NOTSUP if monitor mode was specified but  the  capture
       source  doesn't	support  monitor  mode, PCAP_ERROR_IFACE_NOT_UP if the
       capture source is not up, and PCAP_ERROR if another error occurred.  If
       PCAP_WARNING  or PCAP_ERROR is returned, pcap_geterr() or pcap_perror()
       may be called with p as an argument  to	fetch  or  display  a  message
       describing  the	warning  or  error.   If  PCAP_WARNING_PROMISC_NOTSUP,
       PCAP_ERROR_NO_SUCH_DEVICE,  or  PCAP_ERROR_PERM_DENIED	is   returned,
       pcap_geterr()  or  pcap_perror() may be called with p as an argument to
       fetch or display an message giving additional details about the problem
       that might be useful for debugging the problem if it's unexpected.
