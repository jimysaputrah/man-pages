NAME
       getyx,  getparyx,  getbegyx,  getmaxyx  -  get curses cursor and window
       coordinates

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curses.h>

       void getyx(WINDOW *win, int y, int x);
       void getparyx(WINDOW *win, int y, int x);
       void getbegyx(WINDOW *win, int y, int x);
       void getmaxyx(WINDOW *win, int y, int x);

DESCRIPTION
       The getyx macro places the current cursor position of the given	window
       in the two integer variables y and x.

       If  win is a subwindow, the getparyx macro places the beginning coordi-
       nates of the subwindow relative to the parent window into  two  integer
       variables y and x.  Otherwise, -1 is placed into y and x.

       Like  getyx,  the getbegyx and getmaxyx macros store the current begin-
       ning coordinates and size of the specified window.

RETURN VALUE
       The return values of these macros are undefined (i.e., they should  not
       be used as the right-hand side of assignment statements).

NOTES
       All  of these interfaces are macros.  A "&" is not necessary before the
       variables y and x.

PORTABILITY
       The getyx, getparyx, getbegyx and getmaxyx macros are described in  the
       XSI Curses standard, Issue 4.

       This  implementation also provides functions getbegx, getbegy, getcurx,
       getcury, getmaxx, getmaxy, getparx and getpary for  compatibility  with
       older versions of curses.

       Although X/Open Curses does not address this, many implementations pro-
       vide members of the WINDOW structure containing values corresponding to
       these  macros.	For best portability, do not rely on using the data in
       WINDOW, since some implementations make WINDOW  opaque  (do  not  allow
       direct use of its members).

       Besides the problem of opaque structures, the data stored in like-named
       members may not have like-values  in  different	implementations.   For
       example,  the  WINDOW._maxx and WINDOW._maxy values in ncurses have (at
       least since release 1.8.1) differed by one from some other  implementa-
       tions.  The difference is hidden by means of the macro getmaxyx.
