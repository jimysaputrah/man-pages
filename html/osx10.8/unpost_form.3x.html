NAME
       form_post - write or erase forms from associated subwindows

SYNOPSIS
       #include &ltform.h&gt
       int post_form(FORM *form);
       int unpost_form(FORM *form);

DESCRIPTION
       The function post_form displays a form to its associated subwindow.  To
       trigger physical display of the subwindow, use refresh or some  equiva-
       lent curses routine (the implicit doupdate triggered by an curses input
       request will do).

       The function unpost_form erases form from its associated subwindow.

RETURN VALUE
       These routines return one of the following:

       E_OK The routine succeeded.

       E_BAD_ARGUMENT
	    Routine detected an incorrect or out-of-range argument.

       E_BAD_STATE
	    Routine was called from an initialization or termination function.

       E_NOT_POSTED
	    The form has not been posted.

       E_NOT_CONNECTED
	    No items are connected to the form.

       E_NO_ROOM
	    Form is too large for its window.

       E_POSTED
	    The form has already been posted.

       E_SYSTEM_ERROR
	    System error occurred (see errno).

SEE ALSO
       curses(3X), form(3X).

NOTES
       The  header  file  &ltform.h&gt  automatically  includes  the  header  file
       &ltcurses.h&gt.

PORTABILITY
       These routines emulate the System V forms library.  They were not  sup-
       ported on Version 7 or BSD versions.
