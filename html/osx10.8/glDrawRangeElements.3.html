NAME
       glDrawRangeElements - render primitives from array data


C SPECIFICATION
       void glDrawRangeElements( GLenum mode,
				 GLuint start,
				 GLuint end,
				 GLsizei count,
				 GLenum type,
				 const GLvoid *indices )


PARAMETERS
       mode	Specifies  what  kind  of primitives to render.  Symbolic con-
		stants	GL_POINTS,  GL_LINE_STRIP,   GL_LINE_LOOP,   GL_LINES,
		GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP,	  GL_TRIANGLE_FAN,	 GL_TRIANGLES,
		GL_QUAD_STRIP, GL_QUADS, and GL_POLYGON are accepted.

       start	Specifies the minimum array index contained in indices.

       end	Specifies the maximum array index contained in indices.

       count	Specifies the number of elements to be rendered.

       type	Specifies the type of the values in  count.  Must  be  one  of
		GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT, or GL_UNSIGNED_INT.

       indices	Specifies  a  pointer  to  the	location where the indices are
		stored.

DESCRIPTION
       glDrawRangeElements is  a  restricted  form  of	glDrawElements.  mode,
       start,	end,   and   count   match   the  corresponding  arguments  to
       glDrawElements, with the additional constraint that all values  in  the
       arrays count must lie between start and end, inclusive.

       Implementations denote recommended maximum amounts of vertex and
       index  data,  which  may  be  queried  by  calling  glGet with argument
       GL_MAX_ELEMENTS_VERTICES and GL_MAX_ELEMENTS_INDICES.  If end - start +
       1 is greater than the value of GL_MAX_ELEMENTS_VERTICES, or if count is
       greater than the value of GL_MAX_ELEMENTS_INDICES, then	the  call  may
       operate	at reduced performance.  There is no requirement that all ver-
       tices in the range [start, end] be referenced.  However, the  implemen-
       tation may partially process unused vertices, reducing performance from
       what could be achieved with an optimal index set.

       When glDrawRangeElements is called, it uses count  sequential  elements
       from  an  enabled  array,  starting at start to construct a sequence of
       geometric primitives. mode specifies what kind of primitives  are  con-
       structed,  and  how  the  array elements construct these primitives. If
       more than one array is enabled, each is used. If GL_VERTEX_ARRAY is not
       enabled, no geometric primitives are constructed.

       Vertex  attributes  that  are  modified	by glDrawRangeElements have an
       unspecified value after glDrawRangeElements returns.  For  example,  if
       GL_COLOR_ARRAY  is enabled, the value of the current color is undefined
       after glDrawRangeElements executes.  Attributes	that  aren't  modified
       maintain their previous values.

NOTES
       glDrawRangeElements  is	available  only  if  the  GL version is 1.2 or
       greater.

       glDrawRangeElements    is    included	in    display	 lists.     If
       glDrawRangeElements is entered into a display list, the necessary array
       data (determined by the array pointers and  enables)  is  also  entered
       into  the  display  list.  Because  the	array pointers and enables are
       client-side state, their values affect display lists when the lists are
       created, not when the lists are executed.

ERRORS
       It  is  an error for indices to lie outside the range [start, end], but
       implementations may not check for this situation.  Such	indices  cause
       implementation-dependent behavior.

       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if mode is not an accepted value.

       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if count is negative.

       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if end &lt start.

       GL_INVALID_OPERATION  is  generated  if glDrawRangeElements is executed
       between the execution of glBegin and the corresponding glEnd.
