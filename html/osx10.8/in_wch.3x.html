NAME
       in_wch,	mvin_wch, mvwin_wch, win_wch - extract a complex character and
       rendition from a window

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curses.h>

       int in_wch(cchar_t *wcval);
       int mvin_wch(int y, int x, cchar_t *wcval);
       int mvwin_wch(WINDOW *win, int y, int x, cchar_t *wcval);
       int win_wch(WINDOW *win, cchar_t *wcval);

DESCRIPTION
       These functions extract the complex character and  rendition  from  the
       current position in the named window into the cchar_t object referenced
       by wcval.

RETURN VALUE
       No errors are defined in the XSI Curses standard.  This	implementation
       checks  for null pointers, returns ERR in that case.  Also, the mv rou-
       tines check for error moving the cursor, returning ERR  in  that  case.
       Otherwise they return OK

NOTES
       Note that all of these routines may be macros.

PORTABILITY
       These functions are described in the XSI Curses standard, Issue 4.

SEE ALSO
       curses(3X), curs_inch(3X).
