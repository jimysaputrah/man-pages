NAME
       PPI::Token::Unknown - Token of unknown or as-yet undetermined type

INHERITANCE
	 PPI::Token::Unknown
	 isa PPI::Token
	     isa PPI::Element

DESCRIPTION
       Object of the type "PPI::Token::Unknown" exist primarily inside the
       tokenizer, where they are temporarily brought into existing for a very
       short time to represent a token that could be one of a number of types.

       Generally, they only exist for a character or two, after which they are
       resolved and converted into the correct type. For an object of this
       type to survive the parsing process is considered a major bug.

       Please report any "PPI::Token::Unknown" you encounter in a
       PPI::Document object as a bug.

SUPPORT
       See the support section in the main module.
