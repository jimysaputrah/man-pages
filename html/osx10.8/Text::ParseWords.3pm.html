NAME
       Text::ParseWords - parse text into an array of tokens or array of
       arrays

SYNOPSIS
	 use Text::ParseWords;
	 @lists = nested_quotewords($delim, $keep, @lines);
	 @words = quotewords($delim, $keep, @lines);
	 @words = shellwords(@lines);
	 @words = parse_line($delim, $keep, $line);
	 @words = old_shellwords(@lines); # DEPRECATED!

DESCRIPTION
       The &nested_quotewords() and &quotewords() functions accept a delimiter
       (which can be a regular expression) and a list of lines and then breaks
       those lines up into a list of words ignoring delimiters that appear
       inside quotes.  &quotewords() returns all of the tokens in a single
       long list, while &nested_quotewords() returns a list of token lists
       corresponding to the elements of @lines.  &parse_line() does tokenizing
       on a single string.  The &*quotewords() functions simply call
       &parse_line(), so if you're only splitting one line you can call
       &parse_line() directly and save a function call.

       The $keep argument is a boolean flag.  If true, then the tokens are
       split on the specified delimiter, but all other characters (quotes,
       backslashes, etc.) are kept in the tokens.  If $keep is false then the
       &*quotewords() functions remove all quotes and backslashes that are not
       themselves backslash-escaped or inside of single quotes (i.e.,
       &quotewords() tries to interpret these characters just like the Bourne
       shell).	NB: these semantics are significantly different from the
       original version of this module shipped with Perl 5.000 through 5.004.
       As an additional feature, $keep may be the keyword "delimiters" which
       causes the functions to preserve the delimiters in each string as
       tokens in the token lists, in addition to preserving quote and
       backslash characters.

       &shellwords() is written as a special case of &quotewords(), and it
       does token parsing with whitespace as a delimiter-- similar to most
       Unix shells.

EXAMPLES
       The sample program:

	 use Text::ParseWords;
	 @words = quotewords('\s+', 0, q{this	is "a test" of\ quotewords \"for you});
	 $i = 0;
	 foreach (@words) {
	     print "$i: &lt$_&gt\n";
	     $i++;
	 }

       produces:

	 0: &ltthis&gt
	 1: &ltis&gt
	 2: &lta test&gt
	 3: &ltof quotewords&gt
	 4: &lt"for&gt
	 5: &ltyou&gt

       demonstrating:

       0   a simple word

       1   multiple spaces are skipped because of our $delim

       2   use of quotes to include a space in a word

       3   use of a backslash to include a space in a word

       4   use of a backslash to remove the special meaning of a double-quote

       5   another simple word (note the lack of effect of the backslashed
	   double-quote)

       Replacing "quotewords('\s+', 0, q{this	is...})" with
       "shellwords(q{this   is...})" is a simpler way to accomplish the same
       thing.

       for assuring me that a &nested_quotewords() would be useful, and to
       Jeff Friedl &ltjfriedl@yahoo-inc.com&gt for telling me not to worry about
       error-checking (sort of-- you had to be there).
