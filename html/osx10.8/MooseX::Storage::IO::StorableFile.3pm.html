NAME
       MooseX::Storage::IO::StorableFile - An Storable File I/O role

SYNOPSIS
	 package Point;
	 use Moose;
	 use MooseX::Storage;

	 with Storage('io' =&gt 'StorableFile');

	 has 'x' =&gt (is =&gt 'rw', isa =&gt 'Int');
	 has 'y' =&gt (is =&gt 'rw', isa =&gt 'Int');

	 1;

	 my $p = Point-&gtnew(x =&gt 10, y =&gt 10);

	 ## methods to load/store a class
	 ## on the file system

	 $p-&gtstore('my_point');

	 my $p2 = Point-&gtload('my_point');

DESCRIPTION
       This module will "load" and "store" Moose classes using Storable. It
       uses "Storable::nstore" by default so that it can be easily used across
       machines or just locally.

       One important thing to note is that this module does not mix well with
       the other Format modules. Since Storable serialized perl data
       structures in it's own format, those roles are lagely unnecessary.

       However, there is always the possibility that having a set of
       "freeze/thaw" hooks can be useful, so because of that this module will
       attempt to use "freeze" or "thaw" if that method is available.  Of
       course, you should be careful when doing this as it could lead to all
       sorts of hairy issues. But you have been warned.

METHODS
       load ($filename)
       store ($filename)

   Introspection
       meta
