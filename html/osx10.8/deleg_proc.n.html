DESCRIPTION
       This  package  provides a single command for the convenient creation of
       procedures which delegate the actual work to a remote  location	via  a
       "channel" created by the package comm.

API
       ::interp::delegate::proc ?-async? name arguments comm id
	      This  commands  creates  a  procedure which is named by name and
	      returns its fully-qualified name. All invokations of this proce-
	      dure  will delegate the actual work to the remote location iden-
	      tified by the comm channel comm and the endpoint id.

	      The name of the remote procedure invoked	by  the  delegator  is
	      [namespace  tail	name]. I.e., namespace information is stripped
	      from the call.

	      Normally the generated procedure marshalls  the  arguments,  and
	      returns  the result from the remote procedure as its own result.
	      If however the option -async was specified  then	the  generated
	      procedure will not wait for a result and return immediately.
