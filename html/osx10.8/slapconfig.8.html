NAME
     slapconfig -- tool to configure slapd and related daemons

SYNOPSIS
     slapconfig command [command-options] [-q]

DESCRIPTION
     slapconfig is a utility for configuring slapd. It must be run by root.

USAGE
     -q 		   suppress prompts.

   Queries
     -defaultsuffix	   Returns the default suffix which is based on the
			   machine's DNS name, or hostname if DNS is not
			   available.

     -getclientconfig	   Returns whether this machine is an LDAP client, not
			   a client, or advanced.

     -getldapconfig	   Returns the LDAP server settings.

     -getmacosxodpolicy    Returns a property list containing the directory
			   binding settings.

     -getmasterconfig	   Returns the list of replicas and replication inter-
			   val.

     -getpasswordserveraddress
			   Returns the IP address of the default password
			   server.

     -getreplicaconfig	   Returns the master address and last update date.

     -getstyle		   Returns whether configuration is master, replica,
			   client, or standalone.

     -help		   Print usage information.

     -ver		   Displays version information.

   Setup
     -addreplica [--serverID num] [--guid
     D1C9C376-D940-404D-9941-7AD24E6A37DA] &ltreplica-address&gt
     Adds a replication link with the specified server.  The serverID and GUID
     of the remote machine you'd like to replicate with.  The serverID and
     GUID can be viewed in the target machine's computer record.  Replication
     links are unidirectional, the corresponding command should be run on the
     target server as well to get full replication working.  Caution should be
     exercised with this command, it is best to avoid replication loops.

     -changeip &ltold-ip&gt &ltnew-ip&gt [&ltold-host&gt &ltnew-host&gt]
     Updates configuration records and files to contain the new host informa-
     tion.  It does not change the IP address in Network preferences.

     -createldapmasterandadmin [--allow_local_realm] [--certAuthName &ltCert
     Auth Name&gt] [--certAdminEmail &ltCert Admin Email&gt] [--certOrgName &ltCert
     Org Name&gt] &ltnew-admin&gt &ltnew-fullname&gt &ltnew-uid&gt [&ltsearch base suffix&gt
     [&ltrealm&gt]]
     Creates a new master LDAP server. Copies the root account to the new mas-
     ter domain. Creates a new directory node administrator.

     -createreplica [--certAdminEmail &ltCert Admin Email&gt] &ltmaster IP or name&gt
     &ltadmin user&gt
     Create a new replica from an existing LDAP master.

     -createrootcertauthority &ltCertificate Authority Name&gt &ltCertificate
     Authority Admin Email&gt &ltCertificate Authority Organization Name&gt
     Create a CA on the OD master.

     -destroyldapserver [diradmin]
     Turns off the LDAP server and deletes its database.  The optional argu-
     ment of the diradmin account name will then prompt for the diradmin pass-
     word and will inform all replication peers of the server's destruction.

     -promotereplica &ltadmin-user&gt &ltarchive-path&gt
     Converts an existing replica into a master using the current database.
     Path to an archive from the master can given in order to add the root
     CA's keys to the promoted master.

     -removereplica [--guid D1C9C376-D940-404D-9941-7AD24E6A37DA]
     -&ltreplica-address&gt
     Removes a replication link with the specified server.  The GUID of the
     remote server being removed should be passed in with the --guid option.
     Replication links are unidirectional, so the corresponding command should
     be run on the target server to remove the other half of an existing
     replication link.

     -setclient
     Configures the machine to bind using DHCP if it is not already a client.

     -setldapconfig [-maxresults &ltmaximum search results&gt] [-searchtimeout
     timeout] [-ssl on|off] [-sslcert &ltpath to cert&gt] [-sslkey &ltpath to key&gt]
     [-sslcacert &ltpath to CA cert&gt]
     Applies the specified settings and restarts slapd. Settings not specified
     are unchanged.

     -setstandalone
     Configures the machine to only use the local directory.

     -setmacosxodpolicy [-binding [disabled|enabled|required]] [-cleartext
     [blocked|allowed]] [-encrypt [yes|no]] [-sign [yes|no]] [-clientcaching
     [yes|no]] [-man-in-middle [blocked|allowed]]
     Sets directory binding options.

     -startldapserver	   Configures launchd to run slapd.

     -stopldapserver	   Configures launchd not to run slapd.

     -updateaddresses	   Merges new interfaces into the list of LDAP repli-
			   cas.

   Password Server
     -pwsrekey keysize	   Divorces the password server from a replicated sys-
			   tem and issues a new RSA key. Users in the local
			   and LDAP directories are migrated to the new key.
			   Valid key sizes are 1024, 2048, and 3072. There is
			   a performance penalty when using large keys.

     -settopasswordserver user directory-administrator
			   Converts a user account to have an Open Directory
			   authentication type. A new password server slot and
			   kerberos principal are created. If the user was
			   previously an Open Directory user, the old slot and
			   principal are deleted and replaced.

     -startpasswordserver  Sets up a launchd plist file and starts the pass-
			   word server.

     -stoppasswordserver   Sets the launchd plist file to be disabled and
			   stops the password server.

   Runtime
     -enableslapdlog	   Turns on the LDAP server logging to
			   /var/log/slapd.log.

     -setfullsyncmode [yes | no]
			   The LDAP server defaults to running in a "full sync
			   mode" to ensure database transactions are fully
			   flushed to disk.  This improves data integrity in
			   the event of a power loss, but can result in slower
			   performance when importing large datasets.  Setting
			   this option to no disables this functionality tem-
			   porarily in order to speed up large imports.  After
			   the import has been completed, this option should
			   be set back to yes for normal operation.

   Backup and Restore
     -backupdb &ltarchive-path&gt
     Creates an archive containing the LDAP, Password Server and Kerberos
     databases. It also contains Certificate Authority related data.

     -restoredb &ltarchive-path&gt
     Restores a directory to the backed-up state.

ENVIRONMENT
     The environment variable SSOUtilDebugLevel can be set to change the ver-
     bosity of the log.  Valid values are [0-9]. The default value is 1.
