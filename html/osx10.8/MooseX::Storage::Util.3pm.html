MooseX::Storage::Util(User Contributed Perl DocumentatMooseX::Storage::Util(3)



NAME
       MooseX::Storage::Util - A MooseX::Storage swiss-army chainsaw

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides a set of tools, some sharp and focused, others
       more blunt and crude. But no matter what, they are useful bits to have
       around when dealing with MooseX::Storage code.

METHODS
       All the methods in this package are class methods and should be called
       appropriately.

       peek ($data, %options)
	   This method will help you to verify that the serialized class you
	   have gotten is what you expect it to be before you actually
	   unfreeze/unpack it.

	   The $data can be either a perl HASH ref or some kind of serialized
	   data (JSON, YAML, etc.).

	   The %options are as follows:

	   format
	       If this is left blank, we assume that $data is a plain perl
	       HASH ref otherwise we attempt to inflate $data based on the
	       value of this option.

	       Currently only JSON and YAML are supported here.

	   key The default is to try and extract the class name, but if you
	       want to check another key in the data, you can set this option.
	       It will return the value found in the key for you.
