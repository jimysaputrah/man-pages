AU_USER(3)		 BSD Library Functions Manual		    AU_USER(3)

NAME
     setauuser, endauuser, getauuserent, getauuserent_r, getauusernam,
     getauusernam_r, au_user_mask, getfauditflags -- look up information from
     the audit_user database

LIBRARY
     Basic Security Module Library (libbsm, -lbsm)

SYNOPSIS
     #include &ltbsm/libbsm.h&gt

     void
     setauuser(void);

     void
     endauuser(void);

     struct au_user_ent *
     getauuserent(void);

     struct au_user_ent *
     getauuserent_r(struct au_user_ent *u);

     struct au_user_ent *
     getauusernam(const char *name);

     struct au_user_ent *
     getauusernam_r(struct au_user_ent *u, const char *name);

     int
     au_user_mask(char *username, au_mask_t *mask_p);

     int
     getfauditflags(au_mask_t *usremask, au_mask_t *usrdmask,
	 au_mask_t *lastmask);

DESCRIPTION
     These interfaces may be used to look up information from the
     audit_user(5) database, which describes per-user audit configuration.
     Audit user entries are described by a au_user_ent, which stores the
     user's name in au_name, events to always audit in au_always, and events
     never to audit au_never.

     The getauuserent() function returns the next user found in the
     audit_user(5) database, or the first if the function has not yet been
     called.  NULL will be returned if no further records are available.

     The getauusernam() function looks up a user by name.  NULL will be
     returned if no matching class can be found.

     The setauuser() function resets the iterator through the audit_user(5)
     database, causing the next call to getauuserent() to start again from the
     beginning of the file.

     The endauuser() function closes the audit_user(5) database, if open.

     The au_user_mask() function calculates a new session audit mask to be
     returned via mask_p for the user identified by username.  If the user
     audit configuration is not found, the default system audit properties
     returned by getacflg(3) are used.	The resulting mask may be set via a
     call to setaudit(2) or related variants.

     The getfauditflags() function generates a new process audit state by com-
     bining the audit masks passed as parameters with the system audit masks.

HISTORY
     The OpenBSM implementation was created by McAfee Research, the security
     division of McAfee Inc., under contract to Apple Computer, Inc., in 2004.
     It was subsequently adopted by the TrustedBSD Project as the foundation
     for the OpenBSM distribution.

AUTHORS
     This software was created by Robert Watson, Wayne Salamon, and Suresh
     Krishnaswamy for McAfee Research, the security research division of
     McAfee, Inc., under contract to Apple Computer, Inc.

     The Basic Security Module (BSM) interface to audit records and audit
     event stream format were defined by Sun Microsystems.

BUGS
     These routines cannot currently distinguish between an entry not being
     found and an error accessing the database.  The implementation should be
     changed to return an error via errno when NULL is returned.
