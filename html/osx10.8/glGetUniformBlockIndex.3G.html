NAME
       glGetUniformBlockIndex - retrieve the index of a named uniform block

C SPECIFICATION
       GLuint glGetUniformBlockIndex(GLuint program,
				     const GLchar *uniformBlockName);

PARAMETERS
       program
	   Specifies the name of a program containing the uniform block.

       uniformBlockName
	   Specifies the address an array of characters to containing the name
	   of the uniform block whose index to retrieve.

DESCRIPTION
       glGetUniformBlockIndex retrieves the index of a uniform block within
       program.


       program must be the name of a program object for which the command
       glLinkProgram() must have been called in the past, although it is not
       required that glLinkProgram() must have succeeded. The link could have
       failed because the number of active uniforms exceeded the limit.


       uniformBlockName must contain a nul-terminated string specifying the
       name of the uniform block.


       glGetUniformBlockIndex returns the uniform block index for the uniform
       block named uniformBlockName of program. If uniformBlockName does not
       identify an active uniform block of program, glGetUniformBlockIndex
       returns the special identifier, GL_INVALID_INDEX. Indices of the active
       uniform blocks of a program are assigned in consecutive order,
       beginning with zero.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if program is not the name of a
       program object for which glLinkProgram() has been called in the past.

NOTES
       glGetUniformBlockIndex is available only if the GL version is 3.1 or
       greater.
