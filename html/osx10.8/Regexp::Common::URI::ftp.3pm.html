NAME
       Regexp::Common::URI::ftp -- Returns a pattern for FTP URIs.

SYNOPSIS
	   use Regexp::Common qw /URI/;

	   while (<>) {
	       /$RE{URI}{FTP}/	     and  print "Contains an FTP URI.\n";
	   }

DESCRIPTION
   $RE{URI}{FTP}{-type}{-password};
       Returns a regex for FTP URIs. Note: FTP URIs are not formally defined.
       RFC 1738 defines FTP URLs, but parts of that RFC have been obsoleted by
       RFC 2396. However, the differences between RFC 1738 and RFC 2396 are
       such that they aren't applicable straightforwardly to FTP URIs.

       There are two main problems:

       Passwords.
	   RFC 1738 allowed an optional username and an optional password
	   (separated by a colon) in the FTP URL. Hence, colons were not
	   allowed in either the username or the password. RFC 2396 strongly
	   recommends passwords should not be used in URIs. It does allow for
	   userinfo instead. This userinfo part may contain colons, and hence
	   contain more than one colon. The regexp returned follows the RFC
	   2396 specification, unless the {-password} option is given; then
	   the regex allows for an optional username and password, separated
	   by a colon.

       The ;type specifier.
	   RFC 1738 does not allow semi-colons in FTP path names, because a
	   semi-colon is a reserved character for FTP URIs. The semi-colon is
	   used to separate the path from the option type specifier. However,
	   in RFC 2396, paths consist of slash separated segments, and each
	   segment is a semi-colon separated group of parameters.
	   Straigthforward application of RFC 2396 would mean that a trailing
	   type specifier couldn't be distinguished from the last segment of
	   the path having a two parameters, the last one starting with type=.
	   Therefore we have opted to disallow a semi-colon in the path part
	   of an FTP URI.

	   Furthermore, RFC 1738 allows three values for the type specifier,
	   A, I and D (either upper case or lower case). However, the internet
	   draft about FTP URIs [DRAFT-FTP-URL] (which expired in May 1997)
	   notes the lack of consistent implementation of the D parameter and
	   drops D from the set of possible values. We follow this practise;
	   however, RFC 1738 behaviour can be archieved by using the -type =
	   "[ADIadi]"> parameter.

       FTP URIs have the following syntax:

	   "ftp:" "//" [ userinfo "@" ] host [ ":" port ]
		       [ "/" path [ ";type=" value ]]

       When using {-password}, we have the syntax:

	   "ftp:" "//" [ user [ ":" password ] "@" ] host [ ":" port ]
		       [ "/" path [ ";type=" value ]]

       Under "{-keep}", the following are returned:

       $1  The complete URI.

       $2  The scheme.

       $3  The userinfo, or if {-password} is used, the username.

       $4  If {-password} is used, the password, else "undef".

       $5  The hostname or IP address.

       $6  The port number.

       $7  The full path and type specification, including the leading slash.

       $8  The full path and type specification, without the leading slash.

       $9  The full path, without the type specification nor the leading
	   slash.

       $10 The value of the type specification.
