NAME
       mvn - Maven - a Java based project management and comprehension tool.

SYNOPSIS
       mvn [options] [&ltgoal(s)&gt] [&ltphase(s)&gt]

DESCRIPTION
       Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool.  Based
       on the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a
       project's build, reporting and documentation from a central piece of
       information.  Builds, documentation, source metrics, and source cross-
       references are all controlled by your POM.

       Maven has many goals, but in a nutshell Maven aims to make the
       developer's life easier by providing a well defined project structure,
       well defined development processes to follow, and a coherent body of
       documentation that keeps your developers and clients apprised of what's
       happening with your project.  Maven alleviates a lot of what most
       developers consider drudgery and lets them get on with the task at
       hand.  This is essential in OSS projects where there aren't many people
       dedicated to the task of documenting and propagating the critical
       information about your project which is necessary in order to attract
       potential new developers and clients.
