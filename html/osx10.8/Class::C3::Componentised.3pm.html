NAME
       Class::C3::Componentised

DESCRIPTION
       Load mix-ins or components to your C3-based class.

SYNOPSIS
	 package MyModule;

	 use strict;
	 use warnings;

	 use base 'Class::C3::Componentised';

	 sub component_base_class { "MyModule::Component" }

	 package main;

	 MyModule-&gtload_components( qw/Foo Bar/ );
	 # Will load MyModule::Component::Foo and MyModule::Component::Bar

DESCRIPTION
       This will inject base classes to your module using the Class::C3 method
       resolution order.

       Please note: these are not plugins that can take precedence over
       methods declared in MyModule. If you want something like that, consider
       MooseX::Object::Pluggable.

METHODS
   load_components( @comps )
       Loads the given components into the current module. If a module begins
       with a "+" character, it is taken to be a fully qualified class name,
       otherwise "$class-&gtcomponent_base_class" is prepended to it.

       Calling this will call "Class::C3::reinitialize".

   load_own_components( @comps )
       Similar to load_components, but assumes every class is "$class::$comp".

   load_optional_components
       As load_components, but will silently ignore any components that cannot
       be found.

   ensure_class_loaded
       Given a class name, tests to see if it is already loaded or otherwise
       defined. If it is not yet loaded, the package is require'd, and an
       exception is thrown if the class is still not loaded.

	BUG: For some reason, packages with syntax errors are added to %INC on
	     require

   ensure_class_found
       Returns true if the specified class is installed or already loaded,
       false otherwise.

       Note that the underlying mechanism (Class::Inspector-&gtinstalled()) used
       by this sub will not, at the time of writing, correctly function when
       @INC includes coderefs. Since PAR relies upon coderefs in @INC, this
       function should be avoided in modules that are likely to be included
       within a PAR.

   inject_base
       Does the actual magic of adjusting @ISA on the target module.

   load_optional_class
       Returns a true value if the specified class is installed and loaded
       successfully, throws an exception if the class is found but not loaded
       successfully, and false if the class is not installed
