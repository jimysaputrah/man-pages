NAME
       Pod::Readme - Convert POD to README file

SYNOPSIS
	 use Pod::Readme;
	 my $parser = Pod::Readme->new();

	 # Read POD from STDIN and write to STDOUT
	 $parser->parse_from_filehandle;

	 # Read POD from Module.pm and write to README
	 $parser->parse_from_file('Module.pm', 'README');

DESCRIPTION
       This module is a subclass of Pod::PlainText which provides additional
       POD markup for generating README files.

       Why should one bother with this? One can simply use

	 pod2text Module.pm > README

       A problem with doing that is that the default pod2text converter will
       add text to links, so that "L<Module>" is translated to "the Module
       manpage".

       Another problem is that the README includes the entirety of the module
       documentation!  Most people browsing the README file do not need all of
       this information.

       Likewise, including installation and requirement information in the
       module documentation is not necessary either, since the module is
       already installed.

       This module allows authors to mark portions of the POD to be included
       only in, or to be excluded from the README file.  It also allows you to
       include portions of another file (such as a separate ChangeLog).

   Markup
       Special POD markup options are described below:

       begin/end
	     =begin readme

	     =head1 README ONLY

	     This section will only show up in the README file.

	     =end readme

	   Delineates a POD section that is only available in README file. If
	   you prefer to include plain text instead, add the "text" modifier:

	     =begin readme text

	     README ONLY (PLAINTEXT)

		 This section will only show up in the README file.

	     =end readme

	   Note that placing a colon before the section to indicate that it is
	   POD (e.g. "begin :readme") is not supported in this version.

       stop/continue
	     =for readme stop

	   All POD that follows will not be included in the README, until a
	   "continue" command occurs:

	     =for readme continue

       include
	     =for readme include file=filename type=type start=Regexp stop=Regexp

	     =for readme include file=Changes start=^0.09 stop=^0.081 type=text

	   Includes a plaintext file named filename, starting with the line
	   that contains the start "Regexp" and ending at the line that begins
	   with the stop "Regexp".  (The start and stop Regexps are optional:
	   one or both may be omitted.)

	   Type may be "text" or "pod". If omitted, "pod" will be assumed.

	   Quotes may be used when the filename or marks contains spaces:

	     =for readme include file="another file.pod"

       One can also using maintain multiple file types (such as including
       TODO, or COPYING) by using a modified constructor:

	 $parser = Pod::Readme->new( readme_type => "copying" );

       In the above "Markup" commands replace "readme" with the tag specified
       instead (such as "copying"):

	 =begin copying

       As of version 0.03 you can specify multiple sections by separating them
       with a comma:

	 =begin copying,readme

       There is also no standard list of type names.  Some names might be
       recognized by other POD processors (such as "testing" or "html").
       Pod::Readme will reject the following "known" type names when they are
       specified in the constructor:

	   testing html xhtml xml docbook rtf man nroff dsr rno latex tex code

       You can also use a "debug" mode to diagnose any problems, such as
       mistyped format names:

	 $parser = Pod::Readme->new( debug => 1 );

       Warnings will be issued for any ignored formatting commands.

   Example
       For an example, see the Readme.pm file in this distribution.
