ARGUMENTS
       Tcl_Condition *condPtr (in)		     A	 condition   variable,
						     which must be  associated
						     with a mutex lock.

       Tcl_Mutex *mutexPtr (in) 		     A mutex lock.

       Tcl_Time *timePtr (in)			     A	time limit on the con-
						     dition  wait.   NULL   to
						     wait  forever.  Note that
						     a polling value of 0 sec-
						     onds  does  not make much
						     sense.

       Tcl_ThreadDataKey *keyPtr (in)		     This identifies  a  block
						     of  thread local storage.
						     The key should be	static
						     and   process-wide,   yet
						     each thread will  end  up
						     associating  a  different
						     block  of	storage   with
						     this key.

       int *size (in)				     The  size	of  the thread
						     local   storage	block.
						     This  amount  of  data is
						     allocated and initialized
						     to  zero  the  first time
						     each     thread	 calls
						     Tcl_GetThreadData.

       Tcl_ThreadId *idPtr (out)		     The referred storage will
						     contain  the  id  of  the
						     newly  created  thread as
						     returned by the operating
						     system.

       Tcl_ThreadId id (in)			     Id  of  the thread waited
						     upon.

       Tcl_ThreadCreateProc threadProc (in)	     This procedure  will  act
						     as   the  main()  of  the
						     newly created thread. The
						     specified clientData will
						     be its sole argument.

       ClientData clientData (in)		     Arbitrary	  information.
						     Passed  as  sole argument
						     to the threadProc.

       int stackSize (in)			     The  size	of  the  stack
						     given  to the new thread.

       int flags (in)				     Bitmask containing  flags
						     allowing  the  caller  to
						     modify behaviour  of  the
						     new thread.

       int *result (out)			     The  referred  storage is
						     used to  place  the  exit
						     code of the thread waited
						     upon into it.

INTRODUCTION
       Beginning with the 8.1 release, the Tcl	core  is  thread  safe,  which
       allows  you  to incorporate Tcl into multithreaded applications without
       customizing the Tcl core.  To enable Tcl  multithreading  support,  you
       must  include the --enable-threads option to configure when you config-
       ure and compile your Tcl core.

       An important constraint of the Tcl threads implementation is that  only
       the thread that created a Tcl interpreter can use that interpreter.  In
       other words, multiple threads can not access the same Tcl  interpreter.
       (However,  a  single  thread  can safely create and use multiple inter-
       preters.)

DESCRIPTION
       Tcl provides Tcl_CreateThread for  creating  threads.  The  caller  can
       determine  the size of the stack given to the new thread and modify the
       behaviour     through	 the	 supplied     flags.	 The	 value
       TCL_THREAD_STACK_DEFAULT  for  the stackSize indicates that the default
       size as specified by the operating system is to be  used  for  the  new
       thread.	As for the flags, currently only the values TCL_THREAD_NOFLAGS
       and TCL_THREAD_JOINABLE are defined. The  first	of  them  invokes  the
       default behaviour with no specialties. Using the second value marks the
       new thread as joinable. This means that another thread can wait for the
       such marked thread to exit and join it.

       Restrictions: On some UNIX systems the pthread-library does not contain
       the functionality to specify the stack size of a thread. The  specified
       value  for  the	stack  size is ignored on these systems.  Windows cur-
       rently does not support joinable threads. This flag value is  therefore
       ignored on this platform.

       Tcl  provides  the  Tcl_ExitThread and Tcl_FinalizeThread functions for
       terminating threads and invoking  optional  per-thread  exit  handlers.
       See the Tcl_Exit page for more information on these procedures.

       The  Tcl_JoinThread  function is provided to allow threads to wait upon
       the exit of another thread, which must have  been  marked  as  joinable
       through	usage  of the TCL_THREAD_JOINABLE-flag during its creation via
       Tcl_CreateThread.

       Trying to wait for the exit of a non-joinable thread or a thread  which
       is  already waited upon will result in an error. Waiting for a joinable
       thread which already exited is possible, the  system  will  retain  the
       necessary  information  until  after  the call to Tcl_JoinThread.  This
       means that not calling Tcl_JoinThread for a joinable thread will  cause
       a memory leak.

       The  Tcl_GetThreadData call returns a pointer to a block of thread-pri-
       vate data.  Its argument is a key that is shared by all threads	and  a
       size  for the block of storage.	The storage is automatically allocated
       and initialized to all zeros the first time each thread	asks  for  it.
       The storage is automatically deallocated by Tcl_FinalizeThread.

   SYNCHRONIZATION AND COMMUNICATION
       Tcl  provides  Tcl_ThreadQueueEvent  and  Tcl_ThreadAlert  for handling
       event queuing in multithreaded applications.  See the  Notifier	manual
       page for more information on these procedures.

       A mutex is a lock that is used to serialize all threads through a piece
       of code by calling Tcl_MutexLock and Tcl_MutexUnlock.   If  one	thread
       holds  a mutex, any other thread calling Tcl_MutexLock will block until
       Tcl_MutexUnlock is called.  A mutex can be destroyed after its  use  by
       calling	Tcl_MutexFinalize.   The  result of locking a mutex twice from
       the same thread is undefined.  On some platforms it will  result  in  a
       deadlock.   The	Tcl_MutexLock,	Tcl_MutexUnlock  and Tcl_MutexFinalize
       procedures are defined as empty macros if not  compiling  with  threads
       enabled.  For declaration of mutexes the TCL_DECLARE_MUTEX macro should
       be used.  This macro assures correct mutex handling even when the  core
       is compiled without threads enabled.

       A  condition  variable  is  used as a signaling mechanism: a thread can
       lock a mutex and then wait on a condition variable with	Tcl_Condition-
       Wait.   This  atomically releases the mutex lock and blocks the waiting
       thread until another thread calls Tcl_ConditionNotify.  The  caller  of
       Tcl_ConditionNotify should have the associated mutex held by previously
       calling Tcl_MutexLock, but this is not enforced.  Notifying the	condi-
       tion  variable  unblocks all threads waiting on the condition variable,
       but they do not proceed until the mutex is released  with  Tcl_MutexUn-
       lock.   The implementation of Tcl_ConditionWait automatically locks the
       mutex before returning.

       The caller of Tcl_ConditionWait should be prepared for spurious notifi-
       cations	by  calling  Tcl_ConditionWait	within a while loop that tests
       some invariant.

       A condition variable can be destroyed after its use by calling Tcl_Con-
       ditionFinalize.

       The  Tcl_ConditionNotify,  Tcl_ConditionWait  and Tcl_ConditionFinalize
       procedures are defined as empty macros if not  compiling  with  threads
       enabled.

   INITIALIZATION
       All  of	these synchronization objects are self-initializing.  They are
       implemented as opaque pointers that should be NULL upon first use.  The
       mutexes	and  condition variables are either cleaned up by process exit
       handlers (if living that long) or explicitly by calls  to  Tcl_MutexFi-
       nalize  or  Tcl_ConditionFinalize.   Thread  local storage is reclaimed
       during Tcl_FinalizeThread.

SCRIPT-LEVEL ACCESS TO THREADS
       Tcl provides no built-in commands for scripts to use to create, manage, |
       or  join  threads,  nor	any  script-level access to mutex or condition |
       variables.  It provides such facilities	only  via  C  interfaces,  and |
       leaves  it  up to packages to expose these matters to the script level. |
       One such package is the Thread package.
