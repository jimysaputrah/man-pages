NAME
       HTML::Parse - Deprecated, a wrapper around HTML::TreeBuilder

SYNOPSIS
	 See the documentation for HTML::TreeBuilder

DESCRIPTION
       Disclaimer: This module is provided only for backwards compatibility
       with earlier versions of this library.  New code should not use this
       module, and should really use the HTML::Parser and HTML::TreeBuilder
       modules directly, instead.

       The "HTML::Parse" module provides functions to parse HTML documents.
       There are two functions exported by this module:

       parse_html($html) or parse_html($html, $obj)
	   This function is really just a synonym for $obj->parse($html) and
	   $obj is assumed to be a subclass of "HTML::Parser".	Refer to
	   HTML::Parser for more documentation.

	   If $obj is not specified, the $obj will default to an internally
	   created new "HTML::TreeBuilder" object configured with
	   strict_comment() turned on.	That class implements a parser that
	   builds (and is) a HTML syntax tree with HTML::Element objects as
	   nodes.

	   The return value from parse_html() is $obj.

       parse_htmlfile($file, [$obj])
	   Same as parse_html(), but pulls the HTML to parse, from the named
	   file.

	   Returns "undef" if the file could not be opened, or $obj otherwise.

       When a "HTML::TreeBuilder" object is created, the following variables
       control how parsing takes place:

       $HTML::Parse::IMPLICIT_TAGS
	   Setting this variable to true will instruct the parser to try to
	   deduce implicit elements and implicit end tags.  If this variable
	   is false you get a parse tree that just reflects the text as it
	   stands.  Might be useful for quick & dirty parsing.	Default is
	   true.

	   Implicit elements have the implicit() attribute set.

       $HTML::Parse::IGNORE_UNKNOWN
	   This variable contols whether unknow tags should be represented as
	   elements in the parse tree.	Default is true.

       $HTML::Parse::IGNORE_TEXT
	   Do not represent the text content of elements.  This saves space if
	   all you want is to examine the structure of the document.  Default
	   is false.

       $HTML::Parse::WARN
	   Call warn() with an apropriate message for syntax errors.  Default
	   is false.

REMEMBER!
       HTML::TreeBuilder objects should be explicitly destroyed when you're
       finished with them.  See HTML::TreeBuilder.
