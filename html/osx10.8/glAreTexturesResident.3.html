NAME
       glAreTexturesResident  -  determine  if	textures are loaded in texture
       memory


C SPECIFICATION
       GLboolean glAreTexturesResident( GLsizei n,
					const GLuint *textures,
					GLboolean *residences )


PARAMETERS
       n	   Specifies the number of textures to be queried.

       textures    Specifies an array containing the names of the textures  to
		   be queried.

       residences  Specifies an array in which the texture residence status is
		   returned.  The residence status of a texture  named	by  an
		   element  of	textures is returned in the corresponding ele-
		   ment of residences.

DESCRIPTION
       GL establishes a ``working set'' of textures that are resident in  tex-
       ture memory.  These textures can be bound to a texture target much more
       efficiently than textures that are not resident.

       glAreTexturesResident queries the texture residence  status  of	the  n
       textures  named by the elements of textures.  If all the named textures
       are resident, glAreTexturesResident returns GL_TRUE, and  the  contents
       of residences are undisturbed.  If not all the named textures are resi-
       dent, glAreTexturesResident returns GL_FALSE, and  detailed  status  is
       returned  in the n elements of residences.  If an element of residences
       is GL_TRUE, then the texture named by the corresponding element of tex-
       tures is resident.

       The  residence  status of a single bound texture may also be queried by
       calling glGetTexParameter with the target argument set to the target to
       which   the   texture   is   bound,  and  the  pname  argument  set  to
       GL_TEXTURE_RESIDENT.  This is the only way that the residence status of
       a default texture can be queried.

NOTES
       glAreTexturesResident  is  available  only  if the GL version is 1.1 or
       greater.

       glAreTexturesResident returns the residency status of the  textures  at
       the  time  of  invocation. It does not guarantee that the textures will
       remain resident at any other time.

       If textures reside in virtual memory (there is no texture memory), they
       are considered always resident.

       Some implementations may not load a texture until the first use of that
       texture.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if n is negative.

       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if any element in textures is 0  or  does
       not name a texture. In that case, the function returns GL_FALSE and the
       contents of residences is indeterminate.

       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if glAreTexturesResident is  executed
       between	the  execution	of  glBegin and the corresponding execution of
       glEnd.

ASSOCIATED GETS
       glGetTexParameter with parameter name GL_TEXTURE_RESIDENT retrieves the
       residence status of a currently bound texture.
