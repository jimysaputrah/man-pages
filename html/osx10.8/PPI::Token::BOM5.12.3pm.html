PPI::Token::BOM(3)    User Contributed Perl Documentation   PPI::Token::BOM(3)



NAME
       PPI::Token::BOM - Tokens representing Unicode byte order marks

INHERITANCE
	 PPI::Token::BOM
	 isa PPI::Token
	     isa PPI::Element

DESCRIPTION
       This is a special token in that it can only occur at the beginning of
       documents.  If a BOM byte mark occurs elsewhere in a file, it should be
       treated as PPI::Token::Whitespace.  We recognize the byte order marks
       identified at this URL: &lthttp://www.unicode.org/faq/utf_bom.html#BOM&gt

	   UTF-32, big-endian	  00 00 FE FF
	   UTF-32, little-endian  FF FE 00 00
	   UTF-16, big-endian	  FE FF
	   UTF-16, little-endian  FF FE
	   UTF-8		  EF BB BF

       Note that as of this writing, PPI only has support for UTF-8 (namely,
       in POD and strings) and no support for UTF-16 or UTF-32.  We support
       the BOMs of the latter two for completeness only.

       The BOM is considered non-significant, like white space.

METHODS
       There are no additional methods beyond those provided by the parent
       PPI::Token and PPI::Element classes.

SUPPORT
       See the support section in the main module
