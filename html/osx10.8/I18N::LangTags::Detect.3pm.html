NAME
       I18N::LangTags::Detect - detect the user's language preferences

SYNOPSIS
	 use I18N::LangTags::Detect;
	 my @user_wants = I18N::LangTags::Detect::detect();

DESCRIPTION
       It is a common problem to want to detect what language(s) the user
       would prefer output in.

FUNCTIONS
       This module defines one public function,
       "I18N::LangTags::Detect::detect()".  This function is not exported (nor
       is even exportable), and it takes no parameters.

       In scalar context, the function returns the most preferred language tag
       (or undef if no preference was seen).

       In list context (which is usually what you want), the function returns
       a (possibly empty) list of language tags representing (best first) what
       languages the user apparently would accept output in.  You will
       probably want to pass the output of this through
       "I18N::LangTags::implicate_supers_tightly(...)"	or
       "I18N::LangTags::implicate_supers(...)", like so:

	 my @languages =
	   I18N::LangTags::implicate_supers_tightly(
	     I18N::LangTags::Detect::detect()
	   );

ENVIRONMENT
       This module looks for several environment variables, including
       REQUEST_METHOD, HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE, LANGUAGE, LC_ALL, LC_MESSAGES,
       and LANG.

       It will also use the Win32::Locale module, if it's installed.

SEE ALSO
       I18N::LangTags, Win32::Locale, Locale::Maketext.

       (This module's core code started out as a routine in Locale::Maketext;
       but I moved it here once I realized it was more generally useful.)
