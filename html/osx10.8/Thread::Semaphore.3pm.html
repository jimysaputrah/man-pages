NAME
       Thread::Semaphore - Thread-safe semaphores

VERSION
       This document describes Thread::Semaphore version 2.09

SYNOPSIS
	   use Thread::Semaphore;
	   my $s = Thread::Semaphore->new();
	   $s->down();	 # Also known as the semaphore P operation.
	   # The guarded section is here
	   $s->up();	 # Also known as the semaphore V operation.

	   # The default semaphore value is 1
	   my $s = Thread::Semaphore-new($initial_value);
	   $s->down($down_value);
	   $s->up($up_value);

DESCRIPTION
       Semaphores provide a mechanism to regulate access to resources.	Unlike
       locks, semaphores aren't tied to particular scalars, and so may be used
       to control access to anything you care to use them for.

       Semaphores don't limit their values to zero and one, so they can be
       used to control access to some resource that there may be more than one
       of (e.g., filehandles).	Increment and decrement amounts aren't fixed
       at one either, so threads can reserve or return multiple resources at
       once.

METHODS
       ->new()
       ->new(NUMBER)
	       "new" creates a new semaphore, and initializes its count to the
	       specified number (which must be an integer).  If no number is
	       specified, the semaphore's count defaults to 1.

       ->down()
       ->down(NUMBER)
	       The "down" method decreases the semaphore's count by the
	       specified number (which must be an integer >= 1), or by one if
	       no number is specified.

	       If the semaphore's count would drop below zero, this method
	       will block until such time as the semaphore's count is greater
	       than or equal to the amount you're "down"ing the semaphore's
	       count by.

	       This is the semaphore "P operation" (the name derives from the
	       Dutch word "pak", which means "capture" -- the semaphore
	       operations were named by the late Dijkstra, who was Dutch).

       ->up()
       ->up(NUMBER)
	       The "up" method increases the semaphore's count by the number
	       specified (which must be an integer >= 1), or by one if no
	       number is specified.

	       This will unblock any thread that is blocked trying to "down"
	       the semaphore if the "up" raises the semaphore's count above
	       the amount that the "down" is trying to decrement it by.  For
	       example, if three threads are blocked trying to "down" a
	       semaphore by one, and another thread "up"s the semaphore by
	       two, then two of the blocked threads (which two is
	       indeterminate) will become unblocked.

	       This is the semaphore "V operation" (the name derives from the
	       Dutch word "vrij", which means "release").

NOTES
       Semaphores created by Thread::Semaphore can be used in both threaded
       and non-threaded applications.  This allows you to write modules and
       packages that potentially make use of semaphores, and that will
       function in either environment.
