NAME
       PPI::Statement::Scheduled - A scheduled code block

INHERITANCE
	 PPI::Statement::Scheduled
	 isa PPI::Statement::Sub
	     isa PPI::Statement
		 isa PPI::Node
		     isa PPI::Element

DESCRIPTION
       A scheduled code block is one that is intended to be run at a specific
       time during the loading process.

       There are five types of scheduled block:

	 BEGIN {
	       # Executes as soon as this block is fully defined
	       ...
	 }

	 CHECK {
	       # Executes after overall compile-phase in reverse order
	       ...
	 }

	 UNITCHECK {
	       # Executes after compile-phase of individual module in reverse order
	       ...
	 }

	 INIT {
	       # Executes just before run-time
	       ...
	 }

	 END {
	       # Executes as late as possible in reverse order
	       ...
	 }

       Technically these scheduled blocks are actually subroutines, and in
       fact may have 'sub' in front of them.

METHODS
   type
       The "type" method returns the type of scheduled block, which should
       always be one of 'BEGIN', 'CHECK', 'UNITCHECK', 'INIT' or 'END'.
