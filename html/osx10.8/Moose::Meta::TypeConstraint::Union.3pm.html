NAME
       Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint::Union - A union of Moose type constraints

VERSION
       version 2.0205

DESCRIPTION
       This metaclass represents a union of type constraints. A union takes
       multiple type constraints, and is true if any one of its member
       constraints is true.

INHERITANCE
       "Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint::Union" is a subclass of
       Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint.

       Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint::Union-&gtnew(%options)
	   This creates a new class type constraint based on the given
	   %options.

	   It takes the same options as its parent. It also requires an
	   additional option, "type_constraints". This is an array reference
	   containing the Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint objects that are the
	   members of the union type. The "name" option defaults to the names
	   all of these member types sorted and then joined by a pipe (|).

	   The constructor sets the implementation of the constraint so that
	   is simply calls "check" on the newly created object.

	   Finally, the constructor also makes sure that the object's
	   "coercion" attribute is a Moose::Meta::TypeCoercion::Union object.

       $constraint-&gttype_constraints
	   This returns the array reference of "type_constraints" provided to
	   the constructor.

       $constraint-&gtparents
	   This returns the same constraint as the "type_constraints" method.

       $constraint-&gtcheck($value)
       $constraint-&gtvalidate($value)
	   These two methods simply call the relevant method on each of the
	   member type constraints in the union. If any type accepts the
	   value, the value is valid.

	   With "validate" the error message returned includes all of the
	   error messages returned by the member type constraints.

       $constraint-&gtequals($type_name_or_object)
	   A type is considered equal if it is also a union type, and the two
	   unions have the same member types.

       $constraint-&gtfind_type_for($value)
	   This returns the first member type constraint for which
	   "check($value)" is true, allowing you to determine which of the
	   Union's member type constraints a given value matches.

       $constraint-&gtis_a_type_of($type_name_or_object)
	   This returns true if any of the member type constraints return true
	   for the "is_a_type_of" method.

       $constraint-&gtis_subtype_of
	   This returns true if any of the member type constraints return true
	   for the "is_a_subtype_of" method.

       $constraint-&gtcreate_child_type(%options)
	   This returns a new Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint object with the type
	   as its parent.
