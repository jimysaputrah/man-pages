NAME
       curl_global_cleanup - global libcurl cleanup

SYNOPSIS
       #include &ltcurl/curl.h&gt

       void curl_global_cleanup(void);

DESCRIPTION
       This function releases resources acquired by curl_global_init(3).

       You  should  call curl_global_cleanup(3) once for each call you make to
       curl_global_init(3), after you are done using libcurl.

       This function is not thread safe. You must not call it when  any  other
       thread  in  the program (i.e. a thread sharing the same memory) is run-
       ning.  This doesn't just mean no other thread that  is  using  libcurl.
       Because	curl_global_cleanup(3) calls functions of other libraries that
       are similarly thread unsafe, it could conflict with  any  other	thread
       that uses these other libraries.

       See  the  description  in libcurl(3) of global environment requirements
       for details of how to use this function.
