NAME
     getauclassent, getauclassent_r, getauclassnam, getauclassnam_r,
     setauclass, endauclass -- look up information from the audit_class data-
     base

LIBRARY
     Basic Security Module Library (libbsm, -lbsm)

SYNOPSIS
     #include &ltbsm/libbsm.h&gt

     struct au_class_ent *
     getauclassent(void);

     struct au_class_ent *
     getauclassent_r(struct au_class_ent *e);

     struct au_class_ent *
     getauclassnam(const char *name);

     struct au_class_ent *
     getauclassnam_r(struct au_class_ent *e, const char *name);

     void
     setauclass(void);

     void
     endauclass(void);

DESCRIPTION
     These interfaces may be used to look up information from the
     audit_class(5) database, which describes audit event classes.  Audit
     event classes are described by struct au_class_ent.

     The getauclassent() function will return the next class found in the
     audit_class(5) database, or the first if the function has not yet been
     called.  NULL will be returned if no further records are available.

     The getauclassnam() function looks up a class by name.  NULL will be
     returned if no matching class can be found.

     The setauclass() function resets the iterator through the audit_class(5)
     database, causing the next call to getauclassent() to start again from
     the beginning of the file.

     The endauclass() function closes the audit_class(5) database, if open.

HISTORY
     The OpenBSM implementation was created by McAfee Research, the security
     division of McAfee Inc., under contract to Apple Computer, Inc., in 2004.
     It was subsequently adopted by the TrustedBSD Project as the foundation
     for the OpenBSM distribution.

AUTHORS
     This software was created by Robert Watson, Wayne Salamon, and Suresh
     Krishnaswamy for McAfee Research, the security research division of
     McAfee, Inc., under contract to Apple Computer, Inc.

     The Basic Security Module (BSM) interface to audit records and audit
     event stream format were defined by Sun Microsystems.

BUGS
     These routines cannot currently distinguish between an entry not being
     found and an error accessing the database.  The implementation should be
     changed to return an error via errno when NULL is returned.
