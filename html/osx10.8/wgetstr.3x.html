NAME
       getstr, getnstr, wgetstr, wgetnstr, mvgetstr, mvgetnstr, mvwgetstr,
       mvwgetnstr - accept character strings from curses terminal keyboard

SYNOPSIS
       #include &ltcurses.h&gt

       int getstr(char *str);
       int getnstr(char *str, int n);
       int wgetstr(WINDOW *win, char *str);
       int wgetnstr(WINDOW *win, char *str, int n);
       int mvgetstr(int y, int x, char *str);
       int mvwgetstr(WINDOW *win, int y, int x, char *str);
       int mvgetnstr(int y, int x, char *str, int n);
       int mvwgetnstr(WINDOW *, int y, int x, char *str, int n);

DESCRIPTION
       The function getstr is equivalent to a series of calls to getch,  until
       a  newline or carriage return is received (the terminating character is
       not included in the returned string).  The resulting value is placed in
       the area pointed to by the character pointer str.

       wgetnstr  reads	at most n characters, thus preventing a possible over-
       flow of the input buffer.  Any attempt to enter more characters	(other
       than  the terminating newline or carriage return) causes a beep.  Func-
       tion keys also cause a beep and	are  ignored.	The  getnstr  function
       reads from the stdscr default window.

       The  user's  erase and kill characters are interpreted.	If keypad mode
       is on for the window, KEY_LEFT and KEY_BACKSPACE  are  both  considered
       equivalent to the user's kill character.

       Characters  input  are  echoed  only  if echo is currently on.  In that
       case, backspace is echoed as deletion of the previous character	(typi-
       cally a left motion).

RETURN VALUE
       All routines return the integer ERR upon failure and an OK (SVr4 speci-
       fies only "an integer value other than ERR")  upon  successful  comple-
       tion.

       X/Open defines no error conditions.

       In  this  implementation, these functions return an error if the window
       pointer is null, or if its timeout expires without having any data.

       This implementation provides an extension as well.  If a  SIGWINCH  in-
       terrupts the function, it will return KEY_RESIZE rather than OK or ERR.

NOTES
       Note that getstr, mvgetstr, and mvwgetstr may be macros.

PORTABILITY
       These functions are described in the  XSI  Curses  standard,  Issue  4.
       They  read  single-byte	characters only.  The standard does not define
       any error conditions.  This implementation returns ERR  if  the	window
       pointer is null, or if the lower-level wgetch call returns an ERR.

       SVr3  and  early  SVr4  curses  implementations did not reject function
       keys; the SVr4.0 documentation claimed that  "special  keys"  (such  as
       function  keys, "home" key, "clear" key, etc.) are "interpreted", with-
       out giving details.  It lied.  In fact, the `character' value  appended
       to  the	string by those implementations was predictable but not useful
       (being, in fact, the low-order eight bits of the key's KEY_ value).

       The functions getnstr, mvgetnstr, and mvwgetnstr were present  but  not
       documented in SVr4.
