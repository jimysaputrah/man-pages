NAME
       glLineStipple - specify the line stipple pattern


C SPECIFICATION
       void glLineStipple( GLint factor,
			   GLushort pattern )


PARAMETERS
       factor	Specifies  a  multiplier for each bit in the line stipple pat-
		tern.  If factor is 3, for example, each bit in the pattern is
		used  three  times before the next bit in the pattern is used.
		factor is clamped to the range [1, 256] and defaults to 1.

       pattern	Specifies a 16-bit integer whose bit pattern determines  which
		fragments of a line will be drawn when the line is rasterized.
		Bit zero is used first; the default pattern is all 1's.

DESCRIPTION
       Line stippling masks out certain fragments produced  by	rasterization;
       those  fragments  will  not be drawn.  The masking is achieved by using
       three parameters: the 16-bit line stipple pattern pattern,  the	repeat
       count factor, and an integer stipple counter s.

       Counter	s  is  reset  to 0 whenever glBegin is called, and before each
       line segment of a glBegin(GL_LINES)/glEnd sequence is generated.  It is
       incremented after each fragment of a unit width aliased line segment is
       generated, or after each i fragments of an i  width  line  segment  are
       generated.  The i fragments associated with count s are masked out if

			   pattern bit (s / factor) mod 16

       is 0, otherwise these fragments are sent to the frame buffer.  Bit zero
       of pattern is the least significant bit.

       Antialiased lines are treated as a sequence of 1 * width rectangles for
       purposes of stippling.  Whether rectagle s is rasterized or not depends
       on the fragment rule described for aliased lines,  counting  rectangles
       rather than groups of fragments.

       To  enable and disable line stippling, call glEnable and glDisable with
       argument GL_LINE_STIPPLE.  When enabled, the line  stipple  pattern  is
       applied	as  described  above.	When disabled, it is as if the pattern
       were all 1's.  Initially, line stippling is disabled.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if glLineStipple is executed  between
       the execution of glBegin and the corresponding execution of glEnd.

ASSOCIATED GETS
       glGet with argument GL_LINE_STIPPLE_PATTERN
       glGet with argument GL_LINE_STIPPLE_REPEAT
       glIsEnabled with argument GL_LINE_STIPPLE
