NAME
       Data::OptList - parse and validate simple name/value option pairs

VERSION
       version 0.106

SYNOPSIS
	 use Data::OptList;

	 my $options = Data::OptList::mkopt([
	   qw(key1 key2 key3 key4),
	   key5 =&gt { ... },
	   key6 =&gt [ ... ],
	   key7 =&gt sub { ... },
	   key8 =&gt { ... },
	   key8 =&gt [ ... ],
	 ]);

       ...is the same thing, more or less, as:

	 my $options = [
	   [ key1 =&gt undef,	   ],
	   [ key2 =&gt undef,	   ],
	   [ key3 =&gt undef,	   ],
	   [ key4 =&gt undef,	   ],
	   [ key5 =&gt { ... },	   ],
	   [ key6 =&gt [ ... ],	   ],
	   [ key7 =&gt sub { ... },  ],
	   [ key8 =&gt { ... },	   ],
	   [ key8 =&gt [ ... ],	   ],
	 ]);

DESCRIPTION
       Hashes are great for storing named data, but if you want more than one
       entry for a name, you have to use a list of pairs.  Even then, this is
       really boring to write:

	 $values = [
	   foo =&gt undef,
	   bar =&gt undef,
	   baz =&gt undef,
	   xyz =&gt { ... },
	 ];

       Just look at all those undefs!  Don't worry, we can get rid of those:

	 $values = [
	   map { $_ =&gt undef } qw(foo bar baz),
	   xyz =&gt { ... },
	 ];

       Aaaauuugh!  We've saved a little typing, but now it requires thought to
       read, and thinking is even worse than typing... and it's got a bug!  It
       looked right, didn't it?  Well, the "xyz =&gt { ... }" gets consumed by
       the map, and we don't get the data we wanted.

       With Data::OptList, you can do this instead:

	 $values = Data::OptList::mkopt([
	   qw(foo bar baz),
	   xyz =&gt { ... },
	 ]);

       This works by assuming that any defined scalar is a name and any
       reference following a name is its value.

FUNCTIONS
   mkopt
	 my $opt_list = Data::OptList::mkopt(
	   $input,
	   $moniker,
	   $require_unique,
	   $must_be,
	 );

       This produces an array of arrays; the inner arrays are name/value
       pairs.  Values will be either "undef" or a reference.

       Valid values for $input:

	undef	 -&gt []
	hashref  -&gt [ [ key1 =&gt value1 ] ... ] # non-ref values become undef
	arrayref -&gt every value followed by a ref becomes a pair: [ value =&gt ref   ]
		    every value followed by undef becomes a pair: [ value =&gt undef ]
		    otherwise, it becomes [ value =&gt undef ] like so:
		    [ "a", "b", [ 1, 2 ] ] -&gt [ [ a =&gt undef ], [ b =&gt [ 1, 2 ] ] ]

       $moniker is a name describing the data, which will be used in error
       messages.

       If $require_unique is true, an error will be thrown if any name is
       given more than once.

       $must_be is either a scalar or array of scalars; it defines what
       kind(s) of refs may be values.  If an invalid value is found, an
       exception is thrown.  If no value is passed for this argument, any
       reference is valid.  If $must_be specifies that values must be CODE,
       HASH, ARRAY, or SCALAR, then Params::Util is used to check whether the
       given value can provide that interface.	Otherwise, it checks that the
       given value is an object of the kind.

       In other words:

	 [ qw(SCALAR HASH Object::Known) ]

       Means:

	 _SCALAR0($value) or _HASH($value) or _INSTANCE($value, 'Object::Known')

   mkopt_hash
	 my $opt_hash = Data::OptList::mkopt_hash($input, $moniker, $must_be);

       Given valid "mkopt" input, this routine returns a reference to a hash.
       It will throw an exception if any name has more than one value.

EXPORTS
       Both "mkopt" and "mkopt_hash" may be exported on request.
