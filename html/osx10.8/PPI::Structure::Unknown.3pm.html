NAME
       PPI::Structure::Unknown - An unknown or unresolved brace structure

INHERITANCE
	 PPI::Structure::Unknown
	 isa PPI::Structure
	     isa PPI::Node
		 isa PPI::Element

DESCRIPTION
       "PPI::Structure::Unknown" is class for braces whose type is unknown, or
       temporarily unknown.

       It primarily exists temporarily inside the lexer. Although some types
       of braces can be determined immediately at opening, there are a number
       of different brace types that can only be correctly identified after
       the braces are closed.

       A structure is typed as unknown during this period it is indeterminate.

       A "PPI::Structure::Unknown" object should not ever make it out of the
       lexer without being converted to it's final type. Any time you
       encounter this class in a PDOM tree it should be considered a bug and
       reported accordingly.

METHODS
       "PPI::Structure::Unknown" has no methods beyond those provided by the
       standard PPI::Structure, PPI::Node and PPI::Element methods.
