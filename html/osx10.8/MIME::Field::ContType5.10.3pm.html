MIME::Field::ContType(User Contributed Perl DocumentatMIME::Field::ContType(3)



NAME
       MIME::Field::ContType - a "Content-type" field

DESCRIPTION
       A subclass of Mail::Field.

       Don't use this class directly... its name may change in the future!
       Instead, ask Mail::Field for new instances based on the field name!

SYNOPSIS
	   use Mail::Field;
	   use MIME::Head;

	   # Create an instance from some text:
	   $field = Mail::Field-&gtnew('Content-type',
				     'text/HTML; charset="US-ASCII"');

	   # Get the MIME type, like 'text/plain' or 'x-foobar'.
	   # Returns 'text/plain' as default, as per RFC 2045:
	   my ($type, $subtype) = split('/', $field-&gttype);

	   # Get generic information:
	   print $field-&gtname;

	   # Get information related to "message" type:
	   if ($type eq 'message') {
	       print $field-&gtid;
	       print $field-&gtnumber;
	       print $field-&gttotal;
	   }

	   # Get information related to "multipart" type:
	   if ($type eq 'multipart') {
	       print $field-&gtboundary;		  # the basic value, fixed up
	       print $field-&gtmultipart_boundary;  # empty if not a multipart message!
	   }

	   # Get information related to "text" type:
	   if ($type eq 'text') {
	       print $field-&gtcharset;	   # returns 'us-ascii' as default
	   }

PUBLIC INTERFACE
       boundary
	   Return the boundary field.  The boundary is returned exactly as
	   given in the "Content-type:" field; that is, the leading double-
	   hyphen ("--") is not prepended.

	   (Well, almost exactly... from RFC 2046:

	      (If a boundary appears to end with white space, the white space
	      must be presumed to have been added by a gateway, and must be deleted.)

	   so we oblige and remove any trailing spaces.)

	   Returns the empty string if there is no boundary, or if the
	   boundary is illegal (e.g., if it is empty after all trailing
	   whitespace has been removed).

       multipart_boundary
	   Like "boundary()", except that this will also return the empty
	   string if the message is not a multipart message.  In other words,
	   there's an automatic sanity check.

       type
	   Try real hard to determine the content type (e.g., "text/plain",
	   "image/gif", "x-weird-type", which is returned in all-lowercase.

	   A happy thing: the following code will work just as you would want,
	   even if there's no subtype (as in "x-weird-type")... in such a
	   case, the $subtype would simply be the empty string:

	       ($type, $subtype) = split('/', $head-&gtmime_type);

	   If the content-type information is missing, it defaults to
	   "text/plain", as per RFC 2045:

	       Default RFC 2822 messages are typed by this protocol as plain text in
	       the US-ASCII character set, which can be explicitly specified as
	       "Content-type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii".  If no Content-Type is
	       specified, this default is assumed.

	   Note: under the "be liberal in what we accept" principle, this
	   routine no longer syntax-checks the content type.  If it ain't
	   empty, just downcase and return it.

NOTES
       Since nearly all (if not all) parameters must have non-empty values to
       be considered valid, we just return the empty string to signify missing
       fields.	If you need to get the real underlying value, use the
       inherited "param()" method (which returns undef if the parameter is
       missing).
