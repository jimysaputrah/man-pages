NAME
       File::Spec::VMS - methods for VMS file specs

SYNOPSIS
	require File::Spec::VMS; # Done internally by File::Spec if needed

DESCRIPTION
       See File::Spec::Unix for a documentation of the methods provided there.
       This package overrides the implementation of these methods, not the
       semantics.

       The default behavior is to allow either VMS or Unix syntax on input and
       to return VMS syntax on output, even when Unix syntax was given on
       input.

       When used with a Perl of version 5.10 or greater and a CRTL possessing
       the relevant capabilities, override behavior depends on the CRTL
       features "DECC$FILENAME_UNIX_REPORT" and "DECC$EFS_CHARSET".  When the
       "DECC$EFS_CHARSET" feature is enabled and the input parameters are
       clearly in Unix syntax, the output will be in Unix syntax.  If
       "DECC$FILENAME_UNIX_REPORT" is enabled and the output syntax cannot be
       determined from the input syntax, the output will be in Unix syntax.

       canonpath (override)
	   Removes redundant portions of file specifications according to the
	   syntax detected.

       catdir (override)
	   Concatenates a list of file specifications, and returns the result
	   as a directory specification.  No check is made for "impossible"
	   cases (e.g. elements other than the first being absolute
	   filespecs).

       catfile (override)
	   Concatenates a list of directory specifications with a filename
	   specification to build a path.

       curdir (override)
	   Returns a string representation of the current directory: '[]' or
	   '.'

       devnull (override)
	   Returns a string representation of the null device: '_NLA0:' or
	   '/dev/null'

       rootdir (override)
	   Returns a string representation of the root directory:
	   'SYS$DISK:[000000]' or '/'

       tmpdir (override)
	   Returns a string representation of the first writable directory
	   from the following list or '' if none are writable:

	       /tmp if C<DECC$FILENAME_UNIX_REPORT> is enabled.
	       sys$scratch:
	       $ENV{TMPDIR}

	   Since perl 5.8.0, if running under taint mode, and if $ENV{TMPDIR}
	   is tainted, it is not used.

       updir (override)
	   Returns a string representation of the parent directory: '[-]' or
	   '..'

       case_tolerant (override)
	   VMS file specification syntax is case-tolerant.

       path (override)
	   Translate logical name DCL$PATH as a searchlist, rather than trying
	   to "split" string value of $ENV{'PATH'}.

       file_name_is_absolute (override)
	   Checks for VMS directory spec as well as Unix separators.

       splitpath (override)
	       ($volume,$directories,$file) = File::Spec->splitpath( $path );
	       ($volume,$directories,$file) = File::Spec->splitpath( $path, $no_file );

	   Passing a true value for $no_file indicates that the path being
	   split only contains directory components, even on systems where you
	   can usually (when not supporting a foreign syntax) tell the
	   difference between directories and files at a glance.

       splitdir (override)
	   Split a directory specification into the components.

       catpath (override)
	   Construct a complete filespec.

       abs2rel (override)
	   Attempt to convert a file specification to a relative
	   specification.  On a system with volumes, like VMS, this may not be
	   possible.

       rel2abs (override)
	   Return an absolute file specification from a relative one.
