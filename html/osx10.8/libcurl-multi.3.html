NAME
       libcurl-multi - how to use the multi interface

DESCRIPTION
       This is an overview on how to use the libcurl multi interface in your C
       programs. There are specific man pages for each function  mentioned  in
       here.  There's  also  the  libcurl-tutorial(3)  man page for a complete
       tutorial to programming with libcurl and the libcurl-easy(3)  man  page
       for an overview of the libcurl easy interface.

       All functions in the multi interface are prefixed with curl_multi.

OBJECTIVES
       The  multi  interface  offers several abilities that the easy interface
       doesn't.  They are mainly:

       1. Enable a "pull" interface. The application that uses libcurl decides
       where and when to ask libcurl to get/send data.

       2.  Enable  multiple  simultaneous transfers in the same thread without
       making it complicated for the application.

       3. Enable the application to wait for action on its own	file  descrip-
       tors and curl's file descriptors simultaneous easily.

ONE MULTI HANDLE MANY EASY HANDLES
       To use the multi interface, you must first create a 'multi handle' with
       curl_multi_init(3). This handle is then used as input  to  all  further
       curl_multi_* functions.

       Each  single  transfer is built up with an easy handle. You must create
       them, and setup the appropriate options for each easy handle,  as  out-
       lined in the libcurl(3) man page, using curl_easy_setopt(3).

       When  the  easy	handle	is setup for a transfer, then instead of using
       curl_easy_perform(3) (as when using the easy interface for  transfers),
       you  should  instead  add  the  easy  handle  to the multi handle using
       curl_multi_add_handle(3). The multi handle is sometimes referred to  as
       a  'multi stack' because of the fact that it may hold a large amount of
       easy handles.

       Should you change your mind, the easy handle is again removed from  the
       multi  stack  using  curl_multi_remove_handle(3). Once removed from the
       multi handle, you can again use other  easy  interface  functions  like
       curl_easy_perform(3)  on the handle or whatever you think is necessary.

       Adding the easy handle to the multi handle does not start the transfer.
       Remember  that one of the main ideas with this interface is to let your
       application drive. You drive the transfers by invoking  curl_multi_per-
       form(3). libcurl will then transfer data if there is anything available
       to transfer. It'll use the callbacks and everything else you have setup
       in  the	individual  easy  handles.  It'll transfer data on all current
       transfers in the multi stack that are ready to  transfer  anything.  It
       may be all, it may be none.

       Your  application can acquire knowledge from libcurl when it would like
       to get invoked to transfer data, so that you don't  have  to  busy-loop
       and  call  that	curl_multi_perform(3)  like crazy. curl_multi_fdset(3)
       offers an interface using which you can extract fd_sets from libcurl to
       use in select() or poll() calls in order to get to know when the trans-
       fers in the multi stack might need attention. This also makes  it  very
       easy  for  your	program  to  wait  for	input on your own private file
       descriptors at the same time or perhaps timeout	every  now  and  then,
       should you want that.

       curl_multi_perform(3)  stores  the number of still running transfers in
       one of its input arguments, and by reading that you can figure out when
       all  the  transfers in the multi handles are done. 'done' does not mean
       successful. One or more of the transfers may have failed. Tracking when
       this number changes, you know when one or more transfers are done.

       To  get information about completed transfers, to figure out success or
       not and similar,  curl_multi_info_read(3)  should  be  called.  It  can
       return a message about a current or previous transfer. Repeated invokes
       of the function get more messages until the message queue is empty. The
       information you receive there includes an easy handle pointer which you
       may use to identify which easy handle the information regards.

       When a single transfer is completed, the  easy  handle  is  still  left
       added to the multi stack. You need to first remove the easy handle with
       curl_multi_remove_handle(3)     and     then	close	  it	  with
       curl_easy_cleanup(3),  or  possibly  set  new  options to it and add it
       again with curl_multi_add_handle(3) to start another transfer.

       When all transfers in the multi stack are done, cleanup the multi  han-
       dle  with  curl_multi_cleanup(3).  Be  careful and please note that you
       MUST invoke separate curl_easy_cleanup(3) calls on  every  single  easy
       handle to clean them up properly.

       If you want to re-use an easy handle that was added to the multi handle
       for transfer, you must first remove it from the multi  stack  and  then
       re-add it again (possibly after having altered some options at your own
       choice).

MULTI_SOCKET
       curl_multi_socket_action(3) function offers a way for  applications  to
       not  only avoid being forced to use select(), but it also offers a much
       more high-performance API that will make a significant  difference  for
       applications using large numbers of simultaneous connections.

       curl_multi_socket_action(3)  is	then  used  instead of curl_multi_per-
       form(3).

       When using this API, you add easy handles to the multi handle  just  as
       with  the  normal multi interface. Then you also set two callbacks with
       the  CURLMOPT_SOCKETFUNCTION  and  CURLMOPT_TIMERFUNCTION  options   to
       curl_multi_setopt(3).

       The API is then designed to inform your application about which sockets
       libcurl is currently using and for what activities (read and/or	write)
       on those sockets your application is expected to wait for.

       Your  application  must	then make sure to receive all sockets informed
       about in the CURLMOPT_SOCKETFUNCTION callback and make sure  it	reacts
       on  the	given  activity on them. When a socket has the given activity,
       you call curl_multi_socket_action(3) specifying which socket and action
       there are.

       The  CURLMOPT_TIMERFUNCTION  callback  is called to set a timeout. When
       that   timeout	expires,   your   application	 should    call    the
       curl_multi_socket_action(3) function saying it was due to a timeout.

BLOCKING
       A  few  areas in the code are still using blocking code, even when used
       from the multi interface. While we certainly want and intend for  these
       to  get	fixed in the future, you should be aware of the following cur-
       rent restrictions:

	- Name resolves unless the c-ares or threaded-resolver backends are used
	- NSS SSL connections
	- HTTP proxy CONNECT operations
	- SOCKS proxy handshakes
	- file:// transfers
	- TELNET transfers
