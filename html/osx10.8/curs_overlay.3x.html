NAME
       overlay, overwrite, copywin - overlay and manipulate overlapped curses
       windows

SYNOPSIS
       #include &ltcurses.h&gt

       int overlay(const WINDOW *srcwin, WINDOW *dstwin);
       int overwrite(const WINDOW *srcwin, WINDOW *dstwin);
       int copywin(const WINDOW *srcwin, WINDOW *dstwin, int sminrow,
	     int smincol, int dminrow, int dmincol, int dmaxrow,
	     int dmaxcol, int overlay);

DESCRIPTION
       The overlay and overwrite routines overlay srcwin  on  top  of  dstwin.
       scrwin and dstwin are not required to be the same size; only text where
       the two windows overlap is copied.  The difference is that  overlay  is
       non-destructive	(blanks  are not copied) whereas overwrite is destruc-
       tive.

       The copywin routine provides a finer granularity of  control  over  the
       overlay	and  overwrite routines.  Like in the prefresh routine, a rec-
       tangle is specified in the destination window, (dminrow,  dmincol)  and
       (dmaxrow, dmaxcol), and the upper-left-corner coordinates of the source
       window, (sminrow, smincol).  If the  argument  overlay  is  true,  then
       copying is non-destructive, as in overlay.

RETURN VALUE
       Routines  that  return an integer return ERR upon failure, and OK (SVr4
       only specifies "an integer value other than ERR") upon successful  com-
       pletion.

       X/Open  defines	no error conditions.  In this implementation, copywin,
       overlay and overwrite return an error if either of the window  pointers
       are null, or if some part of the window would be placed off-screen.

NOTES
       Note that overlay and overwrite may be macros.

PORTABILITY
       The  XSI Curses standard, Issue 4 describes these functions (adding the
       const qualifiers).  It further specifies their behavior in the presence
       of  characters with multibyte renditions (not yet supported in this im-
       plementation).
