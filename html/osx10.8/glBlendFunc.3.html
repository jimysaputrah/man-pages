DESCRIPTION
       In  RGBA  mode,	pixels	can  be drawn using a function that blends the
       incoming (source) RGBA values with the RGBA values that are already  in
       the  frame buffer (the destination values).  Blending is initially dis-
       abled.  Use glEnable and glDisable with argument GL_BLEND to enable and
       disable blending.

       glBlendFunc  defines  the  operation  of  blending  when it is enabled.
       sfactor specifies which of nine methods is used	to  scale  the	source
       color  components.  dfactor specifies which of eight methods is used to
       scale the destination color components.	The  eleven  possible  methods
       are  described  in the following table.	Each method defines four scale
       factors, one each for red, green, blue, and alpha.

       In the table and in subsequent equations, source and destination  color
       components  are referred to as (Rs , Gs , Bs , As ) and (Rd , Gd , Bd ,
       Ad ).  The color specified by glBlendColor is referred to as (Rc , Gc ,
       Bc  ,  Ac  ).  They are understood to have integer values between 0 and
       (kR , kG , kB , kA ), where

				      kc = (2^^ mc) -1

       and (mR , mG , mB , mA ) is the number of red, green, blue,  and  alpha
       bitplanes.

       Source and destination scale factors are referred to as (sR , sG , sB ,
       sA ) and (dR , dG , dB , dA ).  The scale factors described in the  ta-
       ble,  denoted (fR , fG , fB , fA ), represent either source or destina-
       tion factors.  All scale factors have range [0, 1].

	GL_ONE_MINUS_DST_ALPHA	       (1, 1, 1, 1 ) - (Ad / kA , Ad / kA , Ad
       / kA , Ad / kA )
	GL_SRC_ALPHA_SATURATE	     (i, i, i, 1 )
	GL_CONSTANT_COLOR	     (Rc, Gc, Bc, Ac)
	GL_ONE_MINUS_CONSTANT_COLOR(1, 1, 1, 1 ) - (Rc, Gc, Bc, Ac)
	GL_CONSTANT_ALPHA	     (Ac, Ac, Ac, Ac)
	GL_ONE_MINUS_CONSTANT_ALPHA(1, 1, 1, 1 ) - (Ac, Ac, Ac, Ac)


       In the table,


		     i =  min (As , kA - Ad ) / kA

       To determine the blended RGBA values of a pixel when  drawing  in  RGBA
       mode, the system uses the following equations:


		     Rd = min ( kR, Rs sR + Rd dR )
		     Gd = min ( kG, Gs sG + Gd dG )
		     Bd = min ( kB, Bs sB + Bd dB )
		     Ad = min ( kA, As sA + Ad dA )

       Despite	the apparent precision of the above equations, blending arith-
       metic is not exactly specified, because blending operates  with	impre-
       cise  integer  color  values.   However,  a blend factor that should be
       equal to 1 is guaranteed not to modify its multiplicand,  and  a  blend
       factor  equal  to  0  reduces its multiplicand to 0.  For example, when
       sfactor is GL_SRC_ALPHA, dfactor is GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA, and	As  is
       equal to kA, the equations reduce to simple replacement:


		     Rd = Rs
		     Gd = Gs
		     Bd = Bs
		     Ad = As


EXAMPLES
       Transparency  is  best  implemented using blend function (GL_SRC_ALPHA,
       GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA) with primitives sorted from farthest  to  near-
       est.   Note  that  this	transparency  calculation does not require the
       presence of alpha bitplanes in the frame buffer.

       Blend function (GL_SRC_ALPHA, GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA)  is  also	useful
       for rendering antialiased points and lines in arbitrary order.

       Polygon antialiasing is optimized using blend function
       (GL_SRC_ALPHA_SATURATE,	GL_ONE)  with  polygons sorted from nearest to
       farthest.   (See  the  glEnable,  glDisable  reference  page  and   the
       GL_POLYGON_SMOOTH  argument  for  information on polygon antialiasing.)
       Destination alpha bitplanes, which must be present for this blend func-
       tion to operate correctly, store the accumulated coverage.

NOTES
       Incoming  (source) alpha is correctly thought of as a material opacity,
       ranging from 1.0 (kA), representing complete opacity, to 0.0 (0),  rep-
       resenting complete transparency.

       When more than one color buffer is enabled for drawing, the GL performs
       blending separately for each enabled buffer, using the contents of that
       buffer for destination color.  (See glDrawBuffer.)

       Blending  affects  only	RGBA  rendering.  It is ignored by color index
       renderers.

       GL_CONSTANT_COLOR,   GL_ONE_MINUS_CONSTANT_COLOR,    GL_CONSTANT_ALPHA,
       GL_ONE_MINUS_CONSTANT_ALPHA are only available if the GL_ARB_imaging is
       supported by your implementation.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if either sfactor or  dfactor  is  not  an
       accepted value.

       GL_INVALID_OPERATION  is  generated  if glBlendFunc is executed between
       the execution of glBegin and the corresponding execution of glEnd.
