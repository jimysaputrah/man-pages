NAME
       form_field_new - create and destroy form fields

SYNOPSIS
       #include &ltform.h&gt
       FIELD *new_field(int height, int width,
			int toprow, int leftcol,
			int offscreen, int nbuffers);
       FIELD *dup_field(FIELD *field, int toprow, int leftcol);
       FIELD *link_field(FIELD *field, int toprow, int leftcol);
       int free_field(FIELD *field);

DESCRIPTION
       The  function  new_field  allocates a new field and initializes it from
       the parameters given: height, width, row of upper-left  corner,	column
       of  upper-left corner, number off-screen rows, and number of additional
       working buffers.

       The function dup_field duplicates a field  at  a  new  location.   Most
       attributes  (including  current contents, size, validation type, buffer
       count, growth threshold,  justification,  foreground,  background,  pad
       character, options, and user pointer) are copied.  Field status and the
       field page bit are not copied.

       The function link_field acts like dup_field, but the new  field	shares
       buffers with its parent.  Attribute data is separate.

       The function free_field de-allocates storage associated with a field.

RETURN VALUE
       The  function,  new_field,  dup_field, link_field return NULL on error.
       They set errno according to their success:

       E_OK The routine succeeded.

       E_BAD_ARGUMENT
	    Routine detected an incorrect or out-of-range argument.

       E_SYSTEM_ERROR
	    System error occurred, e.g., malloc failure.

       The function free_field returns one of the following:

       E_OK The routine succeeded.

       E_BAD_ARGUMENT
	    Routine detected an incorrect or out-of-range argument.

       E_CONNECTED
	    field is connected.

SEE ALSO
       curses(3X), form(3X).

NOTES
       The  header  file  &ltform.h&gt  automatically  includes  the  header  file
       &ltcurses.h&gt.

PORTABILITY
       These  routines emulate the System V forms library.  They were not sup-
       ported on Version 7 or BSD versions.

       It may be unwise to count on the set of attributes copied by  dup_field
       being  portable;  the  System  V  forms	library documents are not very
       explicit about what gets copied and what does not.
