       in the /private/etc/cups or ~/.cups directory. Each line  in  the  file
       can  be	a configuration directive, a blank line, or a comment. Comment
       lines start with the # character.

       The following directives are understood by the client. Consult the  on-
       line help for detailed descriptions:
