TALAGENT(8)		  BSD System Manager's Manual		   TALAGENT(8)

NAME
     talagent -- helper agent for the Transparent App Lifecycle feature.

SYNOPSIS
     talagent [command [arguments]]

DESCRIPTION
     The talagent daemon provides services related to the Transparent App
     Lifecycle feature.  talagent may also be run manually as a command line
     tool to output information about persistent state.

     The options are as follows:

     -help
	 Outputs usage information.

     -dump bundle_id_fragment
	 Outputs the persistent state of an application whose bundle ID con-
	 tains the given fragment, case insensitive ("textedit" for example).
	 You may also pass a path directly to the app's persistent state
	 directory, usually in ~/Library/Saved Application State.

     -launch bundle_id
	 This launches an app (in this case, TextEdit) in a manner approximat-
	 ing how apps get launched at login. You can pass either a bundle ID
	 fragment or a path to an app.	The app is maintained stopped until
	 you hit return in the launching window (or until it receives SIG-
	 CONT). This is the easiest way to test the login scenario without
	 needing to log in.

     -casinfo [ASN]
	 With no arguments, outputs summary information about all apps. With
	 one argument (an ASN), outputs the CAS record for that app.

     -memory_pressure
	 Simulates memory pressure, which may cause apps that support auto-
	 matic termination to exit. This does not actually allocate any mem-
	 ory.

     -refresh_encryption
	 Rotates the bitmap encryption key, and attempts to cross-encrypt all
	 existing window bitmaps under the new key. This is done periodically
	 by talagent.
