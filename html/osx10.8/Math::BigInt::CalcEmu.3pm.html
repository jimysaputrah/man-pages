NAME
       Math::BigInt::CalcEmu - Emulate low-level math with BigInt code

SYNOPSIS
	       use Math::BigInt::CalcEmu;

DESCRIPTION
       Contains routines that emulate low-level math functions in BigInt, e.g.
       optional routines the low-level math package does not provide on its
       own.

       Will be loaded on demand and called automatically by BigInt.

       Stuff here is really low-priority to optimize, since it is far better
       to implement the operation in the low-level math libary directly,
       possible even using a call to the native lib.

METHODS
   __emu_bxor
   __emu_band
   __emu_bior
