NAME
       glDeleteVertexArrays - delete vertex array objects

C SPECIFICATION
       void glDeleteVertexArrays(GLsizei n, const GLuint *arrays);

PARAMETERS
       n
	   Specifies the number of vertex array objects to be deleted.

       arrays
	   Specifies the address of an array containing the n names of the
	   objects to be deleted.

DESCRIPTION
       glDeleteVertexArrays deletes n vertex array objects whose names are
       stored in the array addressed by arrays. Once a vertex array object is
       deleted it has no contents and its name is again unused. If a vertex
       array object that is currently bound is deleted, the binding for that
       object reverts to zero and the default vertex array becomes current.
       Unused names in arrays are silently ignored, as is the value zero.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if n is negative.
