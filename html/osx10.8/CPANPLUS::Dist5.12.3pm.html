CPANPLUS::Dist(3pm)    Perl Programmers Reference Guide    CPANPLUS::Dist(3pm)



NAME
       CPANPLUS::Dist

SYNOPSIS
	   my $dist = CPANPLUS::Dist::YOUR_DIST_TYPE_HERE->new(
				       module  => $modobj,
				   );

DESCRIPTION
       "CPANPLUS::Dist" is a base class for "CPANPLUS::Dist::MM" and
       "CPANPLUS::Dist::Build". Developers of other "CPANPLUS::Dist::*"
       plugins should look at "CPANPLUS::Dist::Base".

ACCESSORS
       parent()
	   Returns the "CPANPLUS::Module" object that parented this object.

       status()
	   Returns the "Object::Accessor" object that keeps the status for
	   this module.

STATUS ACCESSORS
       All accessors can be accessed as follows:
	   $deb->status->ACCESSOR

       created()
	   Boolean indicating whether the dist was created successfully.
	   Explicitly set to 0 when failed, so a value of "undef" may be
	   interpreted as "not yet attempted".

       installed()
	   Boolean indicating whether the dist was installed successfully.
	   Explicitly set to 0 when failed, so a value of "undef" may be
	   interpreted as "not yet attempted".

       uninstalled()
	   Boolean indicating whether the dist was uninstalled successfully.
	   Explicitly set to 0 when failed, so a value of "undef" may be
	   interpreted as "not yet attempted".

       dist()
	   The location of the final distribution. This may be a file or
	   directory, depending on how your distribution plug in of choice
	   works. This will be set upon a successful create.

   $dist = CPANPLUS::Dist::YOUR_DIST_TYPE_HERE->new( module => MODOBJ );
       Create a new "CPANPLUS::Dist::YOUR_DIST_TYPE_HERE" object based on the
       provided "MODOBJ".

       *** DEPRECATED *** The optional argument "format" is used to indicate
       what type of dist you would like to create (like "CPANPLUS::Dist::MM"
       or "CPANPLUS::Dist::Build" and so on ).

       "CPANPLUS::Dist->new" is exlusively meant as a method to be inherited
       by "CPANPLUS::Dist::MM|Build".

       Returns a "CPANPLUS::Dist::YOUR_DIST_TYPE_HERE" object on success and
       false on failure.

   @dists = CPANPLUS::Dist->dist_types;
       Returns a list of the CPANPLUS::Dist::* classes available

   $bool = CPANPLUS::Dist->rescan_dist_types;
       Rescans @INC for available dist types. Useful if you've installed new
       "CPANPLUS::Dist::*" classes and want to make them available to the
       current process.

   $bool = CPANPLUS::Dist->has_dist_type( $type )
       Returns true if distribution type $type is loaded/supported.

   $bool = $dist->prereq_satisfied( modobj => $modobj, version =>
       $version_spec )
       Returns true if this prereq is satisfied.  Returns false if it's not.
       Also issues an error if it seems "unsatisfiable," i.e. if it can't be
       found on CPAN or the latest CPAN version doesn't satisfy it.

   $configure_requires = $dist->find_configure_requires( [file =>
       /path/to/META.yml] )
       Reads the configure_requires for this distribution from the META.yml
       file in the root directory and returns a hashref with module names and
       versions required.

   $bool = $dist->_resolve_prereqs( ... )
       Makes sure prerequisites are resolved

	   format	   The dist class to use to make the prereqs
			   (ie. CPANPLUS::Dist::MM)

	   prereqs	   Hash of the prerequisite modules and their versions

	   target	   What to do with the prereqs.
			       create  => Just build them
			       install => Install them
			       ignore  => Ignore them

	   prereq_build    If true, always build the prereqs even if already
			   resolved

	   verbose	   Be verbose

	   force	   Force the prereq to be built, even if already resolved
