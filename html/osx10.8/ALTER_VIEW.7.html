NAME
       ALTER_VIEW - change the definition of a view

SYNOPSIS
       ALTER VIEW name ALTER [ COLUMN ] column SET DEFAULT expression
       ALTER VIEW name ALTER [ COLUMN ] column DROP DEFAULT
       ALTER VIEW name OWNER TO new_owner
       ALTER VIEW name RENAME TO new_name
       ALTER VIEW name SET SCHEMA new_schema

DESCRIPTION
       ALTER VIEW changes various auxiliary properties of a view. (If you want
       to modify the view's defining query, use CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW.)

       You must own the view to use ALTER VIEW. To change a view's schema, you
       must also have CREATE privilege on the new schema. To alter the owner,
       you must also be a direct or indirect member of the new owning role,
       and that role must have CREATE privilege on the view's schema. (These
       restrictions enforce that altering the owner doesn't do anything you
       couldn't do by dropping and recreating the view. However, a superuser
       can alter ownership of any view anyway.)

PARAMETERS
       name
	   The name (optionally schema-qualified) of an existing view.

       SET/DROP DEFAULT
	   These forms set or remove the default value for a column. A default
	   value associated with a view column is inserted into INSERT
	   statements on the view before the view's ON INSERT rule is applied,
	   if the INSERT does not specify a value for the column.

       new_owner
	   The user name of the new owner of the view.

       new_name
	   The new name for the view.

       new_schema
	   The new schema for the view.

NOTES
       For historical reasons, ALTER TABLE can be used with views too; but the
       only variants of ALTER TABLE that are allowed with views are equivalent
       to the ones shown above.

EXAMPLES
       To rename the view foo to bar:

	   ALTER VIEW foo RENAME TO bar;

COMPATIBILITY
       ALTER VIEW is a PostgreSQL extension of the SQL standard.
