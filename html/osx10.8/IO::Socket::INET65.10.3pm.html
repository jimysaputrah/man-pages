NAME
       IO::Socket::INET6 - Object interface for AF_INET|AF_INET6 domain
       sockets

SYNOPSIS
	   use IO::Socket::INET6;

DESCRIPTION
       "IO::Socket::INET6" provides an object interface to creating and using
       sockets in either AF_INET or AF_INET6 domains. It is built upon the
       IO::Socket interface and inherits all the methods defined by
       IO::Socket.

CONSTRUCTOR
       new ( [ARGS] )
	   Creates an "IO::Socket::INET6" object, which is a reference to a
	   newly created symbol (see the "Symbol" package). "new" optionally
	   takes arguments, these arguments are in key-value pairs.

	   In addition to the key-value pairs accepted by IO::Socket,
	   "IO::Socket::INET6" provides.

	       Domain	   Address family		AF_INET | AF_INET6 | AF_UNSPEC (default)
	       PeerAddr    Remote host address		&lthostname&gt[:&ltport&gt]
	       PeerHost    Synonym for PeerAddr
	       PeerPort    Remote port or service	&ltservice&gt[(&ltno&gt)] | &ltno&gt
	       PeerFlow    Remote flow information
	       PeerScope   Remote address scope
	       LocalAddr   Local host bind address	hostname[:port]
	       LocalHost   Synonym for LocalAddr
	       LocalPort   Local host bind port 	&ltservice&gt[(&ltno&gt)] | &ltno&gt
	       LocalFlow   Local host flow information
	       LocalScope  Local host address scope
	       Proto	   Protocol name (or number)	"tcp" | "udp" | ...
	       Type	   Socket type			SOCK_STREAM | SOCK_DGRAM | ...
	       Listen	   Queue size for listen
	       ReuseAddr   Set SO_REUSEADDR before binding
	       Reuse	   Set SO_REUSEADDR before binding (deprecated, prefer ReuseAddr)
	       ReusePort   Set SO_REUSEPORT before binding
	       Broadcast   Set SO_BROADCAST before binding
	       Timeout	   Timeout value for various operations
	       MultiHomed  Try all adresses for multi-homed hosts
	       Blocking    Determine if connection will be blocking mode

	   If "Listen" is defined then a listen socket is created, else if the
	   socket type, which is derived from the protocol, is SOCK_STREAM
	   then connect() is called.

	   Although it is not illegal, the use of "MultiHomed" on a socket
	   which is in non-blocking mode is of little use. This is because the
	   first connect will never fail with a timeout as the connect call
	   will not block.

	   The "PeerAddr" can be a hostname,  the IPv6-address on the
	   "2001:800:40:2a05::10" form , or the IPv4-address on the
	   "213.34.234.245" form.  The "PeerPort" can be a number or a
	   symbolic service name.  The service name might be followed by a
	   number in parenthesis which is used if the service is not known by
	   the system.	The "PeerPort" specification can also be embedded in
	   the "PeerAddr" by preceding it with a ":", and closing the IPv6
	   address on bracktes "[]" if necessary:
	   "124.678.12.34:23","[2a05:345f::10]:23","any.server.com:23".

	   If "Domain" is not given, AF_UNSPEC is assumed, that is, both
	   AF_INET and AF_INET6 will be both considered when resolving DNS
	   names. AF_INET6 is prioritary.  If you guess you are in trouble not
	   reaching the peer,(the service is not available via AF_INET6 but
	   AF_INET) you can either try Multihomed (try any address/family
	   until reach) or concrete your address "family" (AF_INET, AF_INET6).

	   If "Proto" is not given and you specify a symbolic "PeerPort" port,
	   then the constructor will try to derive "Proto" from the service
	   name.  As a last resort "Proto" "tcp" is assumed.  The "Type"
	   parameter will be deduced from "Proto" if not specified.

	   If the constructor is only passed a single argument, it is assumed
	   to be a "PeerAddr" specification.

	   If "Blocking" is set to 0, the connection will be in nonblocking
	   mode.  If not specified it defaults to 1 (blocking mode).

	   Examples:

	      $sock = IO::Socket::INET6-&gtnew(PeerAddr =&gt 'www.perl.org',
					    PeerPort =&gt 'http(80)',
					    Proto    =&gt 'tcp');

	   Suppose either you have no IPv6 connectivity or www.perl.org has no
	   http service on IPv6. Then,

	   (Trying all address/families until reach)

	      $sock = IO::Socket::INET6-&gtnew(PeerAddr =&gt 'www.perl.org',
					    PeerPort =&gt 'http(80)',
					    Multihomed =&gt 1 ,
					    Proto    =&gt 'tcp');

	   (Concrete to IPv4 protocol)

	      $sock = IO::Socket::INET6-&gtnew(PeerAddr =&gt 'www.perl.org',
					    PeerPort =&gt 'http(80)',
					    Domain =&gt AF_INET ,
					    Proto    =&gt 'tcp');


	      $sock = IO::Socket::INET6-&gtnew(PeerAddr =&gt 'localhost:smtp(25)');

	      $sock = IO::Socket::INET6-&gtnew(Listen    =&gt 5,
					    LocalAddr =&gt 'localhost',
					    LocalPort =&gt 9000,
					    Proto     =&gt 'tcp');

	      $sock = IO::Socket::INET6-&gtnew('[::1]:25');

	      $sock = IO::Socket::INET6-&gtnew(PeerPort  =&gt 9999,
					    PeerAddr  =&gt inet_ntop(AF_INET6,in6addr_broadcast),
					    Proto     =&gt udp,
					    LocalAddr =&gt 'localhost',
					    Broadcast =&gt 1 )
					or die "Can't bind : $@\n";

	    NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE

	   As of VERSION 1.18 all IO::Socket objects have autoflush turned on
	   by default. This was not the case with earlier releases.
