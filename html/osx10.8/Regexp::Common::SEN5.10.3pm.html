NAME
       Regexp::Common::SEN -- provide regexes for Social-Economical Numbers.

SYNOPSIS
	use Regexp::Common qw /SEN/;

	while (&lt&gt) {
	    /^$RE{SEN}{USA}{SSN}$/    and  print "Social Security Number\n";
	}

DESCRIPTION
       Please consult the manual of Regexp::Common for a general description
       of the works of this interface.

       Do not use this module directly, but load it via Regexp::Common.

   $RE{SEN}{USA}{SSN}{-sep}
       Returns a pattern that matches an American Social Security Number
       (SSN).  SSNs consist of three groups of numbers, separated by a hypen
       ("-").  This pattern only checks for a valid structure, that is, it
       validates whether a number is valid SSN, was a valid SSN, or maybe a
       valid SSN in the future. There are almost a billion possible SSNs, and
       about 400 million are in use, or have been in use.

       If "-sep=P" is specified, the pattern P is used as the separator
       between the groups of numbers.

       Under "-keep" (see Regexp::Common):

       $1  captures the entire SSN.

       $2  captures the first group of digits (the area number).

       $3  captures the second group of digits (the group number).

       $4  captures the third group of digits (the serial number).
