NAME
       TAP::Parser::Scheduler::Job - A single testing job.

VERSION
       Version 3.17

SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTION
       Represents a single test 'job'.

METHODS
   Class Methods
       "new"

	   my $job = TAP::Parser::Scheduler::Job-&gtnew(
	       $name, $desc
	   );

       Returns a new "TAP::Parser::Scheduler::Job" object.

       "on_finish"

       Register a closure to be called when this job is destroyed.

       "finish"

       Called when a job is complete to unlock it.

       "filename"

       "description"

       "context"

       "as_array_ref"

       For backwards compatibility in callbacks.

       "is_spinner"

       Returns false indicating that this is a real job rather than a
       'spinner'. Spinners are returned when the scheduler still has pending
       jobs but can't (because of locking) return one right now.
