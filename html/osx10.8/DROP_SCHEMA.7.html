NAME
       DROP_SCHEMA - remove a schema

SYNOPSIS
       DROP SCHEMA [ IF EXISTS ] name [, ...] [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ]

DESCRIPTION
       DROP SCHEMA removes schemas from the database.

       A schema can only be dropped by its owner or a superuser. Note that the
       owner can drop the schema (and thereby all contained objects) even if
       he does not own some of the objects within the schema.

PARAMETERS
       IF EXISTS
	   Do not throw an error if the schema does not exist. A notice is
	   issued in this case.

       name
	   The name of a schema.

       CASCADE
	   Automatically drop objects (tables, functions, etc.) that are
	   contained in the schema.

       RESTRICT
	   Refuse to drop the schema if it contains any objects. This is the
	   default.

EXAMPLES
       To remove schema mystuff from the database, along with everything it
       contains:

	   DROP SCHEMA mystuff CASCADE;

COMPATIBILITY
       DROP SCHEMA is fully conforming with the SQL standard, except that the
       standard only allows one schema to be dropped per command, and apart
       from the IF EXISTS option, which is a PostgreSQL extension.

SEE ALSO
       ALTER SCHEMA (ALTER_SCHEMA(7)), CREATE SCHEMA (CREATE_SCHEMA(7))
