NAME
       TAP::Parser::Iterator - Internal base class for TAP::Parser Iterators

VERSION
       Version 3.17

SYNOPSIS
	 # see TAP::Parser::IteratorFactory for general usage

	 # to subclass:
	 use vars qw(@ISA);
	 use TAP::Parser::Iterator ();
	 @ISA = qw(TAP::Parser::Iterator);
	 sub _initialize {
	   # see TAP::Object...
	 }

DESCRIPTION
       This is a simple iterator base class that defines TAP::Parser's
       iterator API.  See "TAP::Parser::IteratorFactory" for the preferred way
       of creating iterators.

METHODS
   Class Methods
       "new"

       Create an iterator.  Provided by TAP::Object.

   Instance Methods
       "next"

	while ( my $item = $iter->next ) { ... }

       Iterate through it, of course.

       "next_raw"

       Note: this method is abstract and should be overridden.

	while ( my $item = $iter->next_raw ) { ... }

       Iterate raw input without applying any fixes for quirky input syntax.

       "handle_unicode"

       If necessary switch the input stream to handle unicode. This only has
       any effect for I/O handle based streams.

       The default implementation does nothing.

       "get_select_handles"

       Return a list of filehandles that may be used upstream in a select()
       call to signal that this Iterator is ready. Iterators that are not
       handle-based should return an empty list.

       The default implementation does nothing.

       "wait"

       Note: this method is abstract and should be overridden.

	my $wait_status = $iter->wait;

       Return the "wait" status for this iterator.

       "exit"

       Note: this method is abstract and should be overridden.

	my $wait_status = $iter->exit;

       Return the "exit" status for this iterator.

SUBCLASSING
       Please see "SUBCLASSING" in TAP::Parser for a subclassing overview.

       You must override the abstract methods as noted above.

   Example
       TAP::Parser::Iterator::Array is probably the easiest example to follow.
       There's not much point repeating it here.
