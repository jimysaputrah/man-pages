NAME
       PPI::Document::Fragment - A fragment of a Perl Document

DESCRIPTION
       In some situations you might want to work with a fragment of a larger
       document. "PPI::Document::Fragment" is a class intended for this
       purpose.  It is functionally almost identical to a normal
       PPI::Document, except that it is not possible to get line/column
       positions for the elements within it, and it does not represent a
       scope.

METHODS
   index_locations
       Unlike when called on a PPI::Document object, you should not be
       attempting to find locations of things within a
       PPI::Document::Fragment, and thus any call to the "index_locations"
       will print a warning and return "undef" instead of attempting to index
       the locations of the Elements.

TO DO
       Integrate this into the rest of PPI so it has actual practical uses.
       The most obvious would be to implement arbitrary cut/copy/paste more
       easily.

SUPPORT
       See the support section in the main module.
