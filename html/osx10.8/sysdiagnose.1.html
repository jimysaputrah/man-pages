NAME
     sysdiagnose -- gathers system-wide diagnostic information helpful in
     investigating system performance issues.

SYNOPSIS
     sysdiagnose -h
     sysdiagnose [-t] [-f results_directory] [process_name | pid]

DESCRIPTION
     sysdiagnose tool gathers system diagnostic information helpful in inves-
     tigating system performance issues. A great deal of information is har-
     vested, spanning system state and configuration.  sysdiagnose needs to be
     run as root.  sysdiagnose can be triggered upon pressing a special key
     chord; this is currently Control-Option-Command-Shift-Period.

   What sysdiagnose Collects:
	   o   A spindump of the system
	   o   Several seconds of fs_usage ouput
	   o   Several seconds of top output
	   o   Data about kernel zones
	   o   Status of loaded kernel extensions
	   o   Resident memory usage of user processes
	   o   All system logs, kernel logs, opendirectory log, windowserver
	       log, and log of power management events
	   o   A System Profiler report
	   o   All spin and crash reports
	   o   Disk usage information
	   o   I/O Kit registry information
	   o   Network status
	   o   If a specific process is supplied as an argument: list of mal-
	       loc-allocated buffers in the process's heap is collected
	   o   If a specific process is supplied as an argument: data about
	       unreferenced malloc buffers in the process's memory is col-
	       lected
	   o   If a specific process is supplied as an argument: data about
	       the virtual memory regions allocated in the process

OPTIONS
     -h       Print full usage.

     -f results_directory
	      Specify the directory where the results will be stored. The
	      default results directory is /var/tmp.

     process_name | pid
	      If a single process appears to be slowing down the system, pass-
	      ing in the process name or ID as the argument gathers addition
	      process-specific diagnostic data.

     -t       Enable "Thorough Mode". See below.

THOROUGH MODE
     sysdiagnose can be run in a "Thorough Mode" in which standard data is
     gathered as well as a kernel trace and unflattened allmemory data.
     Enabling "Thorough Mode" for the command-line sysdiagnose and key-chord
     sysdiagnose are independent and are performed as follows:

     For "Thorough Mode" in the command-line sysdiagnose use the "-t" flag.

     To enable "Thorough Mode" for special key-chord launches of sysdiagnose
     execute "touch /var/tmp/.thoroughsysdiagnose"

     To disable "Thorough Mode" for special key-chord launches of sysdiagnose
     execute "rm /var/tmp/.thoroughsysdiagnose"

   Note:
     Gathering the kernel trace and unflattened allmemory data can increase
     the size of sysdiagnose output by hundreds of MB as well as increase the
     time for sysdiagnose to complete.

EXIT STATUS
     sysdiagnose exits with status 0 if there were no internal errors encoun-
     tered during the diagnostic, or >0 when an error unrelated to external
     state occurs or unusable input is provided by the user.
