NAME
       Locale::Maketext::Extract::Plugin::PPI - Perl format parser

SYNOPSIS
	   $plugin = Locale::Maketext::Extract::Plugin::PPI->new(
	       $lexicon 	   # A Locale::Maketext::Extract object
	       @file_types	   # Optionally specify a list of recognised file types
	   )

	   $plugin->extract($filename,$filecontents);

DESCRIPTION
       Does exactly the same thing as the
       Locale::Maketext::Extract::Plugin::Perl parser, but more accurately,
       and more slowly. Considerably more slowly! For this reason it isn't a
       built-in plugin.
