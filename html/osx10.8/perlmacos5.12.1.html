NAME
       README.macos - Perl under Mac OS (Classic)

SYNOPSIS
       This document briefly describes perl under Mac OS (Classic).  If you
       are running perl under Mac OS X, you don't want to be here (unless you
       are in the Classic environment under early versions of Mac OS X).

       When we say "Mac OS" below, we mean Mac OS 7, 8, and 9, and not Mac OS
       X.

DESCRIPTION
       The port of Perl to to Mac OS was officially removed as of Perl 5.12,
       though the last offical production release of MacPerl corresponded to
       Perl 5.6. While Perl 5.10 included the port to Mac OS,
       ExtUtils::MakeMaker, a core part of Perl's module installation
       infrastructure officially dropped support for Mac OS in April 2004.

       Historical information (and working binaries of the last released
       version) are available from &lthttp://dev.macperl.org&gt as of October
       2009.

AUTHOR
       perl was ported to Mac OS by Matthias Neeracher &ltneeracher@mac.com&gt.
       Chris Nandor &ltpudge@pobox.com&gt continued development and maintenance
       for the duration of the port's life.
