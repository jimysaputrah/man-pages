NAME
       CPAN::Nox - Wrapper around CPAN.pm without using any XS module

SYNOPSIS
       Interactive mode:

	 perl -MCPAN::Nox -e shell;

DESCRIPTION
       This package has the same functionality as CPAN.pm, but tries to
       prevent the usage of compiled extensions during its own execution. Its
       primary purpose is a rescue in case you upgraded perl and broke binary
       compatibility somehow.

       under the same terms as Perl itself.
