NAME
       IO::Pty - Pseudo TTY object class

VERSION
       1.10

SYNOPSIS
	   use IO::Pty;

	   $pty = new IO::Pty;

	   $slave  = $pty-&gtslave;

	   foreach $val (1..10) {
	       print $pty "$val\n";
	       $_ = &lt$slave&gt;
	       print "$_";
	   }

	   close($slave);

DESCRIPTION
       "IO::Pty" provides an interface to allow the creation of a pseudo tty.

       "IO::Pty" inherits from "IO::Handle" and so provide all the methods
       defined by the "IO::Handle" package.

       Please note that pty creation is very system-dependend.	If you have
       problems, see IO::Tty for help.

CONSTRUCTOR
       new
	  The "new" constructor takes no arguments and returns a new file
	  object which is the master side of the pseudo tty.

METHODS
       ttyname()
	   Returns the name of the slave pseudo tty. On UNIX machines this
	   will be the pathname of the device.	Use this name for
	   informational purpose only, to get a slave filehandle, use slave().

       slave()
	   The "slave" method will return the slave filehandle of the given
	   master pty, opening it anew if necessary.  If IO::Stty is
	   installed, you can then call "$slave-&gtstty()" to modify the
	   terminal settings.

       close_slave()
	   The slave filehandle will be closed and destroyed.  This is
	   necessary in the parent after forking to get rid of the open
	   filehandle, otherwise the parent will not notice if the child
	   exits.  Subsequent calls of "slave()" will return a newly opened
	   slave filehandle.

       make_slave_controlling_terminal()
	   This will set the slave filehandle as the controlling terminal of
	   the current process, which will become a session leader, so this
	   should only be called by a child process after a fork(), e.g. in
	   the callback to "sync_exec()" (see Proc::SyncExec).	See the "try"
	   script (also "test.pl") for an example how to correctly spawn a
	   subprocess.

       set_raw()
	   Will set the pty to raw.  Note that this is a one-way operation,
	   you need IO::Stty to set the terminal settings to anything else.

	   On some systems, the master pty is not a tty.  This method checks
	   for that and returns success anyway on such systems.  Note that
	   this method must be called on the slave, and probably should be
	   called on the master, just to be sure, i.e.

	     $pty-&gtslave-&gtset_raw();
	     $pty-&gtset_raw();

       clone_winsize_from(\*FH)
	   Gets the terminal size from filehandle FH (which must be a
	   terminal) and transfers it to the pty.  Returns true on success and
	   undef on failure.  Note that this must be called upon the slave,
	   i.e.

	    $pty-&gtslave-&gtclone_winsize_from(\*STDIN);

	   On some systems, the master pty also isatty.  I actually have no
	   idea if setting terminal sizes there is passed through to the
	   slave, so if this method is called for a master that is not a tty,
	   it silently returns OK.

	   See the "try" script for example code how to propagate SIGWINCH.
