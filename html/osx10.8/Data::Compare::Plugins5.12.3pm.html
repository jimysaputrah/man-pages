NAME
       Data::Compare::Plugins - how to extend Data::Compare

DESCRIPTION
       Data::Compare natively handles several built-in data types - scalars,
       references to scalars, references to arrays, references to hashes,
       references to subroutines, compiled regular expressions, and globs.
       For objects, it tries to Do The Right Thing and compares the underlying
       data type.  However, this is not always what you want.  This is
       especially true if you have complex objects which overload
       stringification and/or numification.

       Hence we allow for plugins.

FINDING PLUGINS
       Data::Compare will try to load any module installed on your system
       under the various @INC/Data/Compare/Plugins/ directories.  If there is
       a problem loading any of them, an appropriate warning will be issued.

       Because of how we find plugins, no plugins are available when running
       in "taint" mode.

WRITING PLUGINS
       Internally, plugins are "require"d into Data::Compare.  This means that
       they need to evaluate to true.  We make use of that true value.	Where
       normally you just put:

	   1;

       at the end of an included file, you should instead ensure that you
       return a reference to an array.	This is treated as being true so
       satisfies perl, and is a damned sight more useful.

       Inside that array should be either a description of what this plugin is
       to do, or references to several arrays containing such descriptions.  A
       description consists of two or three items.  First a string telling us
       what the first data-type handled by your plugin is.  Second, (and
       optional, defaulting to the same as the first) the second data-type to
       compare.  To handle comparisons to ordinary scalars, give the empty
       string for the data-type, ie:

	   ['MyType', '', sub { ...}]

       Third and last, we need a reference to the subroutine which does the
       comparison.  That subroutine should expect to take two parameters,
       which will be of the specified type.  It should return 1 if they
       compare the same, or 0 if they compare different.

       Be aware that while you might give a description like:

	   ['Type1', 'Type2', sub { ... }]

       this will handle both comparing Type1 to Type2, and comparing Type2 to
       Type1.  ie, comparison is commutative.

       If you want to use Data::Compare's own comparison function from within
       your handler (to, for example, compare a data structure that you have
       stored somewhere in your object) then you will need to call it as
       Data::Compare::Compare.	However, you must be careful to avoid infinite
       recursion by calling D::C::Compare which in turn calls back to your
       handler.

       The name of your plugins does not matter, only that it lives in one of
       those directories.  Of course, giving it a sensible name means that the
       usual installation mechanisms will put it in the right place, and
       meaningful names will make it easier to debug your code.

       For an example, look at the plugin that handles Scalar::Properties
       objects, which is distributed with Data::Compare.

DISTRIBUTION
       Provided that the above rules are followed I see no reason for you to
       not upload your plugin to the CPAN yourself.  You will need to make
       Data::Compare a pre-requisite, so that the CPAN.pm installer does the
       right thing.

       Alternatively, if you would prefer me to roll your plugin in with the
       Data::Compare distribution, I'd be happy to do so provided that the
       code is clear and well-commented, and that you include tests and
       documentation.
