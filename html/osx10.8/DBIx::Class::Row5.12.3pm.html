NAME
       DBIx::Class::Row - Basic row methods

SYNOPSIS
DESCRIPTION
       This class is responsible for defining and doing basic operations on
       rows derived from DBIx::Class::ResultSource objects.

       Row objects are returned from DBIx::Class::ResultSets using the create,
       find, next and all methods, as well as invocations of 'single' (
       belongs_to, has_one or might_have) relationship accessors of
       DBIx::Class::Row objects.

METHODS
   new
	 my $row = My::Class->new(\%attrs);

	 my $row = $schema->resultset('MySource')->new(\%colsandvalues);

       Arguments: \%attrs or \%colsandvalues
       Returns: A Row object

       While you can create a new row object by calling "new" directly on this
       class, you are better off calling it on a DBIx::Class::ResultSet
       object.

       When calling it directly, you will not get a complete, usable row
       object until you pass or set the "result_source" attribute, to a
       DBIx::Class::ResultSource instance that is attached to a
       DBIx::Class::Schema with a valid connection.

       $attrs is a hashref of column name, value data. It can also contain
       some other attributes such as the "result_source".

       Passing an object, or an arrayref of objects as a value will call
       "set_from_related" in DBIx::Class::Relationship::Base for you. When
       passed a hashref or an arrayref of hashrefs as the value, these will be
       turned into objects via new_related, and treated as if you had passed
       objects.

       For a more involved explanation, see "create" in
       DBIx::Class::ResultSet.

       Please note that if a value is not passed to new, no value will be sent
       in the SQL INSERT call, and the column will therefore assume whatever
       default value was specified in your database. While DBIC will retrieve
       the value of autoincrement columns, it will never make an explicit
       database trip to retrieve default values assigned by the RDBMS. You can
       explicitly request that all values be fetched back from the database by
       calling "discard_changes", or you can supply an explicit "undef" to
       columns with NULL as the default, and save yourself a SELECT.

	CAVEAT:

	The behavior described above will backfire if you use a foreign key column
	with a database-defined default. If you call the relationship accessor on
	an object that doesn't have a set value for the FK column, DBIC will throw
	an exception, as it has no way of knowing the PK of the related object (if
	there is one).

   insert
	 $row->insert;

       Arguments: none
       Returns: The Row object

       Inserts an object previously created by "new" into the database if it
       isn't already in there. Returns the object itself. To insert an
       entirely new row into the database, use "create" in
       DBIx::Class::ResultSet.

       To fetch an uninserted row object, call new on a resultset.

       This will also insert any uninserted, related objects held inside this
       one, see "create" in DBIx::Class::ResultSet for more details.

   in_storage
	 $row->in_storage; # Get value
	 $row->in_storage(1); # Set value

       Arguments: none or 1|0
       Returns: 1|0

       Indicates whether the object exists as a row in the database or not.
       This is set to true when "find" in DBIx::Class::ResultSet, "create" in
       DBIx::Class::ResultSet or "insert" in DBIx::Class::ResultSet are used.

       Creating a row object using "new" in DBIx::Class::ResultSet, or calling
       "delete" on one, sets it to false.

   update
	 $row->update(\%columns?)

       Arguments: none or a hashref
       Returns: The Row object

       Throws an exception if the row object is not yet in the database,
       according to "in_storage".

       This method issues an SQL UPDATE query to commit any changes to the
       object to the database if required (see "get_dirty_columns").  It
       throws an exception if a proper WHERE clause uniquely identifying the
       database row can not be constructed (see significance of primary keys
       for more details).

       Also takes an optional hashref of "column_name => value" pairs to
       update on the object first. Be aware that the hashref will be passed to
       "set_inflated_columns", which might edit it in place, so don't rely on
       it being the same after a call to "update".  If you need to preserve
       the hashref, it is sufficient to pass a shallow copy to "update", e.g.
       ( { %{ $href } } )

       If the values passed or any of the column values set on the object
       contain scalar references, e.g.:

	 $row->last_modified(\'NOW()');
	 # OR
	 $row->update({ last_modified => \'NOW()' });

       The update will pass the values verbatim into SQL. (See SQL::Abstract
       docs).  The values in your Row object will NOT change as a result of
       the update call, if you want the object to be updated with the actual
       values from the database, call "discard_changes" after the update.

	 $row->update()->discard_changes();

       To determine before calling this method, which column values have
       changed and will be updated, call "get_dirty_columns".

       To check if any columns will be updated, call "is_changed".

       To force a column to be updated, call "make_column_dirty" before this
       method.

   delete
	 $row->delete

       Arguments: none
       Returns: The Row object

       Throws an exception if the object is not in the database according to
       "in_storage". Also throws an exception if a proper WHERE clause
       uniquely identifying the database row can not be constructed (see
       significance of primary keys for more details).

       The object is still perfectly usable, but "in_storage" will now return
       0 and the object must be reinserted using "insert" before it can be
       used to "update" the row again.

       If you delete an object in a class with a "has_many" relationship, an
       attempt is made to delete all the related objects as well. To turn this
       behaviour off, pass "cascade_delete => 0" in the $attr hashref of the
       relationship, see DBIx::Class::Relationship. Any database-level cascade
       or restrict will take precedence over a DBIx-Class-based cascading
       delete, since DBIx-Class deletes the main row first and only then
       attempts to delete any remaining related rows.

       If you delete an object within a txn_do() (see "txn_do" in
       DBIx::Class::Storage) and the transaction subsequently fails, the row
       object will remain marked as not being in storage. If you know for a
       fact that the object is still in storage (i.e. by inspecting the cause
       of the transaction's failure), you can use "$obj->in_storage(1)" to
       restore consistency between the object and the database. This would
       allow a subsequent "$obj->delete" to work as expected.

       See also "delete" in DBIx::Class::ResultSet.

   get_column
	 my $val = $row->get_column($col);

       Arguments: $columnname
       Returns: The value of the column

       Throws an exception if the column name given doesn't exist according to
       "has_column".

       Returns a raw column value from the row object, if it has already been
       fetched from the database or set by an accessor.

       If an inflated value has been set, it will be deflated and returned.

       Note that if you used the "columns" or the "select/as" search
       attributes on the resultset from which $row was derived, and did not
       include $columnname in the list, this method will return "undef" even
       if the database contains some value.

       To retrieve all loaded column values as a hash, use "get_columns".

   has_column_loaded
	 if ( $row->has_column_loaded($col) ) {
	    print "$col has been loaded from db";
	 }

       Arguments: $columnname
       Returns: 0|1

       Returns a true value if the column value has been loaded from the
       database (or set locally).

   get_columns
	 my %data = $row->get_columns;

       Arguments: none
       Returns: A hash of columnname, value pairs.

       Returns all loaded column data as a hash, containing raw values. To get
       just one value for a particular column, use "get_column".

       See "get_inflated_columns" to get the inflated values.

   get_dirty_columns
	 my %data = $row->get_dirty_columns;

       Arguments: none
       Returns: A hash of column, value pairs

       Only returns the column, value pairs for those columns that have been
       changed on this object since the last "update" or "insert" call.

       See "get_columns" to fetch all column/value pairs.

   make_column_dirty
	 $row->make_column_dirty($col)

       Arguments: $columnname
       Returns: undefined

       Throws an exception if the column does not exist.

       Marks a column as having been changed regardless of whether it has
       really changed.

   get_inflated_columns
	 my %inflated_data = $obj->get_inflated_columns;

       Arguments: none
       Returns: A hash of column, object|value pairs

       Returns a hash of all column keys and associated values. Values for any
       columns set to use inflation will be inflated and returns as objects.

       See "get_columns" to get the uninflated values.

       See DBIx::Class::InflateColumn for how to setup inflation.

   set_column
	 $row->set_column($col => $val);

       Arguments: $columnname, $value
       Returns: $value

       Sets a raw column value. If the new value is different from the old
       one, the column is marked as dirty for when you next call "update".

       If passed an object or reference as a value, this method will happily
       attempt to store it, and a later "insert" or "update" will try and
       stringify/numify as appropriate. To set an object to be deflated
       instead, see "set_inflated_columns".

   set_columns
	 $row->set_columns({ $col => $val, ... });

       Arguments: \%columndata
       Returns: The Row object

       Sets multiple column, raw value pairs at once.

       Works as "set_column".

   set_inflated_columns
	 $row->set_inflated_columns({ $col => $val, $relname => $obj, ... });

       Arguments: \%columndata
       Returns: The Row object

       Sets more than one column value at once. Any inflated values are
       deflated and the raw values stored.

       Any related values passed as Row objects, using the relation name as a
       key, are reduced to the appropriate foreign key values and stored. If
       instead of related row objects, a hashref of column, value data is
       passed, will create the related object first then store.

       Will even accept arrayrefs of data as a value to a "has_many" in
       DBIx::Class::Relationship key, and create the related objects if
       necessary.

       Be aware that the input hashref might be edited in place, so don't rely
       on it being the same after a call to "set_inflated_columns". If you
       need to preserve the hashref, it is sufficient to pass a shallow copy
       to "set_inflated_columns", e.g. ( { %{ $href } } )

       See also "set_from_related" in DBIx::Class::Relationship::Base.

   copy
	 my $copy = $orig->copy({ change => $to, ... });

       Arguments: \%replacementdata
       Returns: The Row object copy

       Inserts a new row into the database, as a copy of the original object.
       If a hashref of replacement data is supplied, these will take
       precedence over data in the original. Also any columns which have the
       column info attribute "is_auto_increment => 1" are explicitly removed
       before the copy, so that the database can insert its own
       autoincremented values into the new object.

       Relationships will be followed by the copy procedure only if the
       relationship specifies a true value for its cascade_copy attribute.
       "cascade_copy" is set by default on "has_many" relationships and unset
       on all others.

   store_column
	 $row->store_column($col => $val);

       Arguments: $columnname, $value
       Returns: The value sent to storage

       Set a raw value for a column without marking it as changed. This method
       is used internally by "set_column" which you should probably be using.

       This is the lowest level at which data is set on a row object, extend
       this method to catch all data setting methods.

   inflate_result
	 Class->inflate_result($result_source, \%me, \%prefetch?)

       Arguments: $result_source, \%columndata, \%prefetcheddata
       Returns: A Row object

       All DBIx::Class::ResultSet methods that retrieve data from the database
       and turn it into row objects call this method.

       Extend this method in your Result classes to hook into this process,
       for example to rebless the result into a different class.

       Reblessing can also be done more easily by setting "result_class" in
       your Result class. See "result_class" in DBIx::Class::ResultSource.

       Different types of results can also be created from a particular
       DBIx::Class::ResultSet, see "result_class" in DBIx::Class::ResultSet.

   update_or_insert
	 $row->update_or_insert

       Arguments: none
       Returns: Result of update or insert operation

       "Update"s the object if it's already in the database, according to
       "in_storage", else "insert"s it.

   insert_or_update
	 $obj->insert_or_update

       Alias for "update_or_insert"

   is_changed
	 my @changed_col_names = $row->is_changed();
	 if ($row->is_changed()) { ... }

       Arguments: none
       Returns: 0|1 or @columnnames

       In list context returns a list of columns with uncommited changes, or
       in scalar context returns a true value if there are uncommitted
       changes.

   is_column_changed
	 if ($row->is_column_changed('col')) { ... }

       Arguments: $columname
       Returns: 0|1

       Returns a true value if the column has uncommitted changes.

   result_source
	 my $resultsource = $row->result_source;

       Arguments: $result_source_instance
       Returns: a ResultSource instance

       Accessor to the DBIx::Class::ResultSource this object was created from.

   register_column
	 $column_info = { .... };
	 $class->register_column($column_name, $column_info);

       Arguments: $columnname, \%columninfo
       Returns: undefined

       Registers a column on the class. If the column_info has an 'accessor'
       key, creates an accessor named after the value if defined; if there is
       no such key, creates an accessor with the same name as the column

       The column_info attributes are described in "add_columns" in
       DBIx::Class::ResultSource

   get_from_storage
	 my $copy = $row->get_from_storage($attrs)

       Arguments: \%attrs
       Returns: A Row object

       Fetches a fresh copy of the Row object from the database and returns
       it.  Throws an exception if a proper WHERE clause identifying the
       database row can not be constructed (i.e. if the original object does
       not contain its entire
	primary key ). If passed the \%attrs argument, will first apply these
       attributes to the resultset used to find the row.

       This copy can then be used to compare to an existing row object, to
       determine if any changes have been made in the database since it was
       created.

       To just update your Row object with any latest changes from the
       database, use "discard_changes" instead.

       The \%attrs argument should be compatible with "ATTRIBUTES" in
       DBIx::Class::ResultSet.

   discard_changes ($attrs?)
	 $row->discard_changes

       Arguments: none or $attrs
       Returns: self (updates object in-place)

       Re-selects the row from the database, losing any changes that had been
       made. Throws an exception if a proper "WHERE" clause identifying the
       database row can not be constructed (i.e. if the original object does
       not contain its entire primary key).

       This method can also be used to refresh from storage, retrieving any
       changes made since the row was last read from storage.

       $attrs, if supplied, is expected to be a hashref of attributes suitable
       for passing as the second argument to "$resultset->search($cond,
       $attrs)";

       Note: If you are using DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::Replicated as your
       storage, please kept in mind that if you "discard_changes" on a row
       that you just updated or created, you should wrap the entire bit inside
       a transaction.  Otherwise you run the risk that you insert or update to
       the master database but read from a replicant database that has not yet
       been updated from the master.  This will result in unexpected results.

   throw_exception
       See "throw_exception" in DBIx::Class::Schema.

   id
	 my @pk = $row->id;

       Arguments: none
       Returns: A list of primary key values

       Returns the primary key(s) for a row. Can't be called as a class
       method.	Actually implemented in DBIx::Class::PK
