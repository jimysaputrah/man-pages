NAME
       glUseProgram - Installs a program object as part of current rendering
       state

C SPECIFICATION
       void glUseProgram(GLuint program);

PARAMETERS
       program
	   Specifies the handle of the program object whose executables are to
	   be used as part of current rendering state.

DESCRIPTION
       glUseProgram installs the program object specified by program as part
       of current rendering state. One or more executables are created in a
       program object by successfully attaching shader objects to it with
       glAttachShader(), successfully compiling the shader objects with
       glCompileShader(), and successfully linking the program object with
       glLinkProgram().

       A program object will contain an executable that will run on the vertex
       processor if it contains one or more shader objects of type
       GL_VERTEX_SHADER that have been successfully compiled and linked. A
       program object will contain an executable that will run on the geometry
       processor if it contains one or more shader objects of type
       GL_GEOMETRY_SHADER that have been successfully compiled and linked.
       Similarly, a program object will contain an executable that will run on
       the fragment processor if it contains one or more shader objects of
       type GL_FRAGMENT_SHADER that have been successfully compiled and
       linked.

       While a program object is in use, applications are free to modify
       attached shader objects, compile attached shader objects, attach
       additional shader objects, and detach or delete shader objects. None of
       these operations will affect the executables that are part of the
       current state. However, relinking the program object that is currently
       in use will install the program object as part of the current rendering
       state if the link operation was successful (see glLinkProgram() ). If
       the program object currently in use is relinked unsuccessfully, its
       link status will be set to GL_FALSE, but the executables and associated
       state will remain part of the current state until a subsequent call to
       glUseProgram removes it from use. After it is removed from use, it
       cannot be made part of current state until it has been successfully
       relinked.

       If program is zero, then the current rendering state refers to an
       invalid program object and the results of shader execution are
       undefined. However, this is not an error.

       If program does not contain shader objects of type GL_FRAGMENT_SHADER,
       an executable will be installed on the vertex, and possibly geometry
       processors, but the results of fragment shader execution will be
       undefined.

NOTES
       Like buffer and texture objects, the name space for program objects may
       be shared across a set of contexts, as long as the server sides of the
       contexts share the same address space. If the name space is shared
       across contexts, any attached objects and the data associated with
       those attached objects are shared as well.

       Applications are responsible for providing the synchronization across
       API calls when objects are accessed from different execution threads.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if program is neither 0 nor a value
       generated by OpenGL.

       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if program is not a program object.

       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if program could not be made part of
       current state.

       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if transform feedback mode is active.

ASSOCIATED GETS
       glGet() with the argument GL_CURRENT_PROGRAM

       glGetActiveAttrib() with a valid program object and the index of an
       active attribute variable

       glGetActiveUniform() with a valid program object and the index of an
       active uniform variable

       glGetAttachedShaders() with a valid program object

       glGetAttribLocation() with a valid program object and the name of an
       attribute variable

       glGetProgram() with a valid program object and the parameter to be
       queried

       glGetProgramInfoLog() with a valid program object

       glGetUniform() with a valid program object and the location of a
       uniform variable

       glGetUniformLocation() with a valid program object and the name of a
       uniform variable

       glIsProgram()
