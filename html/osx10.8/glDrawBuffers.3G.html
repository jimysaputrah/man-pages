NAME
       glDrawBuffers - Specifies a list of color buffers to be drawn into

C SPECIFICATION
       void glDrawBuffers(GLsizei n, const GLenum *bufs);

PARAMETERS
       n
	   Specifies the number of buffers in bufs.

       bufs
	   Points to an array of symbolic constants specifying the buffers
	   into which fragment colors or data values will be written.

DESCRIPTION
       glDrawBuffers defines an array of buffers into which outputs from the
       fragment shader data will be written. If a fragment shader writes a
       value to one or more user defined output variables, then the value of
       each variable will be written into the buffer specified at a location
       within bufs corresponding to the location assigned to that user defined
       output. The draw buffer used for user defined outputs assigned to
       locations greater than or equal to n is implicitly set to GL_NONE and
       any data written to such an output is discarded.

       The symbolic constants contained in bufs may be any of the following:

       GL_NONE
	   The fragment shader output value is not written into any color
	   buffer.

       GL_FRONT_LEFT
	   The fragment shader output value is written into the front left
	   color buffer.

       GL_FRONT_RIGHT
	   The fragment shader output value is written into the front right
	   color buffer.

       GL_BACK_LEFT
	   The fragment shader output value is written into the back left
	   color buffer.

       GL_BACK_RIGHT
	   The fragment shader output value is written into the back right
	   color buffer.

       GL_COLOR_ATTACHMENTn
	   The fragment shader output value is written into the nth color
	   attachment of the current framebuffer.  n may range from 0 to the
	   value of GL_MAX_COLOR_ATTACHMENTS.

       Except for GL_NONE, the preceding symbolic constants may not appear
       more than once in bufs. The maximum number of draw buffers supported is
       implementation dependent and can be queried by calling glGet() with the
       argument GL_MAX_DRAW_BUFFERS.

NOTES
       The symbolic constants GL_FRONT, GL_BACK, GL_LEFT, GL_RIGHT, and
       GL_FRONT_AND_BACK are not allowed in the bufs array since they may
       refer to multiple buffers.

       If a fragment shader does not write to a user defined output variable,
       the values of the fragment colors following shader execution are
       undefined. For each fragment generated in this situation, a different
       value may be written into each of the buffers specified by bufs.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if one of the values in bufs is not an
       accepted value.

       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if the GL is bound to the default
       framebuffer and one or more of the values in bufs is one of the
       GL_COLOR_ATTACHMENTn tokens.

       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if the GL is bound to a framebuffer object
       and one or more of the values in bufs is anything other than GL_NONE or
       one of the GL_COLOR_ATTACHMENTSn tokens.

       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if n is less than 0.

       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if a symbolic constant other than
       GL_NONE appears more than once in bufs.

       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if any of the entries in bufs (other
       than GL_NONE ) indicates a color buffer that does not exist in the
       current GL context.

       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if n is greater than GL_MAX_DRAW_BUFFERS.

ASSOCIATED GETS
       glGet() with argument GL_MAX_DRAW_BUFFERS

       glGet() with argument GL_DRAW_BUFFERi where i indicates the number of
       the draw buffer whose value is to be queried
