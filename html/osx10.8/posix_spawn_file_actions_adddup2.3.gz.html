POSIX_SPAWN_FILE_ACTI... BSD Library Functions Manual POSIX_SPAWN_FILE_ACTI...

NAME
     posix_spawn_file_actions_addclose posix_spawn_file_actions_addopen -- add
     open or close actions to a posix_spawn_file_actions_t

SYNOPSIS
     #include <spawn.h>

     int
     posix_spawn_file_actions_addclose(posix_spawn_file_actions_t *file_actions,
	 int filedes);

     int
     posix_spawn_file_actions_addopen(posix_spawn_file_actions_t *restrict file_actions,
	 int filedes, const char *restrict path, int oflag, mode_t mode);

     int
     posix_spawn_file_actions_adddup2(posix_spawn_file_actions_t *file_actions,
	 int filedes, int newfiledes);

     int
     posix_spawn_file_actions_addinherit_np(posix_spawn_file_actions_t *file_actions,
	 int filedes);

DESCRIPTION
     The posix_spawn_file_actions_addclose() function adds a close operation
     to the list of operations associated with the object referenced by
     file_actions, for subsequent use in a call to posix_spawn(2) or
     posix_spawnp(2).  The descriptor referred to by filedes is closed as if
     close() had been called on it prior to the new child process starting
     execution.

     The posix_spawn_file_actions_addopen() function adds an open operation to
     the list of operations associated with the object referenced by
     file_actions, for subsequent use in a call to posix_spawn(2) or
     posix_spawnp(2).  The descriptor referred to by filedes is opened using
     the path, oflag, and mode arguments as if open() had been called on it
     prior to the new child process starting execution.  The string path is
     copied by the posix_spawn_file_actions_addopen() function during this
     process, so storage need not be persistent in the caller.

     The posix_spawn_file_actions_adddup2() function adds a dup2 operation to
     the list of operations associated with the object referenced by
     file_actions, for subsequent use in a call to posix_spawn(2) or
     posix_spawnp(2).  The descriptor referred to by newfiledes is created as
     if dup2() had been called on filedes prior to the new child process
     starting execution.

     The posix_spawn_file_actions_addinherit_np() function adds an abstract
     inheritance operation to the list of operations associated with the
     object referenced by file_actions, for subsequent use in a call to
     posix_spawn(2) or posix_spawnp(2).  The pre-existing descriptor referred
     to by filedes is marked for inheritance into the new process image, and
     the FD_CLOEXEC flag is cleared from the file descriptor in the new
     process image.

     Normally, for posix_spawn(2) and posix_spawnp(2), all file descriptors
     are inherited from the parent process into the spawned process, except
     for those explicitly marked as close-on-exec.  However if the flag
     POSIX_SPAWN_CLOEXEC_DEFAULT is set, then during the spawn operation, all
     pre-existing file descriptors in the parent process are treated as if
     they had been marked close-on-exec i.e. none of them are automatically
     inherited.  See posix_spawnattr_setflags(3).  Only file descriptors
     explicitly manipulated via file_actions are made available in the spawned
     process. In that case, posix_spawn_file_actions_addinherit_np() can be
     used to make specific pre-existing file descriptors from the parent
     process be available in the spawned process.

RETURN VALUES
     On success, these functions return 0; on failure they return an error
     number from <errno.h>.

ERRORS
     These functions may fail if:

     [EBADF]		The value specified by filedes is negative or would
			cause the process to exceed the maximum number of open
			files it is allowed.

     [EINVAL]		The value of file_actions is invalid.

     [ENOMEM]		Insufficient memory was available to add the new
			action to file_actions.

     posix_spawn_file_actions_destroy(3), posix_spawnattr_setflags(3).
