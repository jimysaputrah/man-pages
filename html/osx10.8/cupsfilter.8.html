NAME
       cupsfilter - convert a file to another format using cups filters

SYNOPSIS
       cupsfilter  [ -c config-file ] [ -d printer ] [ -e ] -j job-id[,N] [ -m
       mime/type ] [ -n copies ] [ -o name=value ] [ -p filename.ppd  ]  [  -t
       title ] filename

DESCRIPTION
       cupsfilter is a front-end to the CUPS filter subsystem which allows you
       to convert a file to a specific format, just as if you had printed  the
       file through CUPS. By default, cupsfilter generates a PDF file.

OPTIONS
       -c config-file
	    Uses the named cupsd.conf configuration file.

       -d printer
	    Uses information from the named printer.

       -e
	    Use every filter from the PPD file.

       -j job-id[,N]
	    Converts document N from the specified job. If N is omitted, docu-
	    ment 1 is converted.

       -m mime/type
	    Specifies the destination file type.  The  default	file  type  is
	    application/pdf.  Use printer/foo to convert to the printer format
	    defined by the filters in the PPD file.

       -n copies
	    Specifies the number of copies to generate.

       -o name=value
	    Specifies options to pass to the CUPS filters.

       -p filename.ppd
	    Specifies the PPD file to use.

       -t title
	    Specifies the document title.

KNOWN ISSUES
       cupsfilter currently does not use the filters defined in the PPD  file.
       This will be addressed in a future CUPS release.
