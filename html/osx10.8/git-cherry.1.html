NAME
       git-cherry - Find commits not merged upstream

SYNOPSIS
       git cherry [-v] [&ltupstream&gt [&lthead&gt [&ltlimit&gt]]]


DESCRIPTION
       The changeset (or "diff") of each commit between the fork-point and
       &lthead&gt is compared against each commit between the fork-point and
       &ltupstream&gt. The commits are compared with their patch id, obtained from
       the git patch-id program.

       Every commit that doesn't exist in the &ltupstream&gt branch has its id
       (sha1) reported, prefixed by a symbol. The ones that have equivalent
       change already in the &ltupstream&gt branch are prefixed with a minus (-)
       sign, and those that only exist in the &lthead&gt branch are prefixed with
       a plus (+) symbol:

		      __*__*__*__*__&gt &ltupstream&gt
		     /
	   fork-point
		     \__+__+__-__+__+__-__+__&gt &lthead&gt

       If a &ltlimit&gt has been given then the commits along the &lthead&gt branch up
       to and including &ltlimit&gt are not reported:

		      __*__*__*__*__&gt &ltupstream&gt
		     /
	   fork-point
		     \__*__*__&ltlimit&gt__-__+__&gt &lthead&gt

       Because git cherry compares the changeset rather than the commit id
       (sha1), you can use git cherry to find out if a commit you made locally
       has been applied &ltupstream&gt under a different commit id. For example,
       this will happen if you're feeding patches &ltupstream&gt via email rather
       than pushing or pulling commits directly.

OPTIONS
       -v
	   Verbose.

       &ltupstream&gt
	   Upstream branch to compare against. Defaults to the first tracked
	   remote branch, if available.

       &lthead&gt
	   Working branch; defaults to HEAD.

       &ltlimit&gt
	   Do not report commits up to (and including) limit.
