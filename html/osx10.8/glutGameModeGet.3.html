NAME
       glutGameModeGet	-  retrieves  GLUT  device  information represented by
       integers.

SYNTAX
       #include <GLUT/glut.h>

       int glutGameModeGet(GLenum info);

ARGUMENTS
       info	 Name of game mode information to retrieve.

       GLUT_GAME_MODE_ACTIVE
	       Non-zero if GLUT's game mode is active;	zero  if  not  active.
	       Game  mode  is  not active initially.  Game mode becomes active
	       when glutEnterGameMode is called.  Game mode  becomes  inactive
	       when glutLeaveGameMode is called.

       GLUT_GAME_MODE_POSSIBLE
	       Non-zero  if the game mode string last specified to glutGameMo-
	       deString is a possible game mode configuration; zero otherwise.
	       Being  "possible"  does	not  guarantee	that  if  game mode is
	       entered with glutEnterGameMode that the display	settings  will
	       actually  changed.   GLUT_GAME_MODE_DISPLAY_CHANGED  should  be
	       called once game mode is entered to determine  if  the  display
	       mode is actually changed.

       GLUT_GAME_MODE_WIDTH
	       Width in pixels of the screen when game mode is activated.

       GLUT_GAME_MODE_HEIGHT
	       Height in pixels of the screen when game mode is activated.

       GLUT_GAME_MODE_PIXEL_DEPTH
	       Pixel depth of the screen when game mode is activiated.

       GLUT_GAME_MODE_REFRESH_RATE
	       Screen  refresh rate in cyles per second (hertz) when game mode
	       is activated.  Zero is returned if the refresh rate is  unknown
	       or cannot be queried.

       GLUT_GAME_MODE_DISPLAY_CHANGED
	       Non-zero  if  entering  game  mode actually changed the display
	       settings.  If the game mode string is not possible or the  dis-
	       play  mode  could  not be changed for any other reason, zero is
	       returned.

DESCRIPTION
       glutGameModeGet retrieves GLUT game  mode  information  represented  by
       integers. The info parameter determines what type of game mode informa-
       tion to return. Requesting game mode information for  an  invalid  GLUT
       game mode information name returns negative one.
