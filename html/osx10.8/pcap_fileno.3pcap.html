NAME
       pcap_fileno - get the file descriptor for a live capture

SYNOPSIS
       #include &ltpcap/pcap.h&gt

       int pcap_fileno(pcap_t *p);

DESCRIPTION
       If  p  refers  to  a  network device that was opened for a live capture
       using a combination of  pcap_create()  and  pcap_activate(),  or  using
       pcap_open_live(),  pcap_fileno() returns the file descriptor from which
       captured packets are read.

       If p refers to a ``savefile'' that was opened using  fuctions  such  as
       pcap_open_offline()  or	pcap_fopen_offline(), a ``dead'' pcap_t opened
       using pcap_open_dead(), or a pcap_t that was created with pcap_create()
       but  that  has  not yet been activated with pcap_activate(), it returns
       -1.
