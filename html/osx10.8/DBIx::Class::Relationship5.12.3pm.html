NAME
       DBIx::Class::Relationship - Inter-table relationships

SYNOPSIS
	 ## Creating relationships
	 MyApp::Schema::Actor-&gthas_many('actorroles' =&gt 'MyApp::Schema::ActorRole',
				       'actor');
	 MyApp::Schema::Role-&gthas_many('actorroles' =&gt 'MyApp::Schema::ActorRole',
				       'role');
	 MyApp::Schema::ActorRole-&gtbelongs_to('role' =&gt 'MyApp::Schema::Role');
	 MyApp::Schema::ActorRole-&gtbelongs_to('actor' =&gt 'MyApp::Schema::Actor');

	 MyApp::Schema::Role-&gtmany_to_many('actors' =&gt 'actorroles', 'actor');
	 MyApp::Schema::Actor-&gtmany_to_many('roles' =&gt 'actorroles', 'role');

	 ## Using relationships
	 $schema-&gtresultset('Actor')-&gtfind({ id =&gt 1})-&gtroles();
	 $schema-&gtresultset('Role')-&gtfind({ id =&gt 1 })-&gtactorroles-&gtsearch_related('actor', { Name =&gt 'Fred' });
	 $schema-&gtresultset('Actor')-&gtadd_to_roles({ Name =&gt 'Sherlock Holmes'});

       See DBIx::Class::Manual::Cookbook for more.

DESCRIPTION
       The word Relationship has a specific meaning in DBIx::Class, see the
       definition in the Glossary.

       This class provides methods to set up relationships between the tables
       in your database model. Relationships are the most useful and powerful
       technique that DBIx::Class provides. To create efficient database
       queries, create relationships between any and all tables that have
       something in common, for example if you have a table Authors:

	 ID  | Name | Age
	------------------
	  1  | Fred | 30
	  2  | Joe  | 32

       and a table Books:

	 ID  | Author | Name
	--------------------
	  1  |	    1 | Rulers of the universe
	  2  |	    1 | Rulers of the galaxy

       Then without relationships, the method of getting all books by Fred
       goes like this:

	my $fred = $schema-&gtresultset('Author')-&gtfind({ Name =&gt 'Fred' });
	my $fredsbooks = $schema-&gtresultset('Book')-&gtsearch({ Author =&gt $fred-&gtID });

       With a has_many relationship called "books" on Author (see below for
       details), we can do this instead:

	my $fredsbooks = $schema-&gtresultset('Author')-&gtfind({ Name =&gt 'Fred' })-&gtbooks;

       Each relationship sets up an accessor method on the "Row" in
       DBIx::Class::Manual::Glossary objects that represent the items of your
       table. From "ResultSet" in DBIx::Class::Manual::Glossary objects, the
       relationships can be searched using the "search_related" method.  In
       list context, each returns a list of Row objects for the related class,
       in scalar context, a new ResultSet representing the joined tables is
       returned. Thus, the calls can be chained to produce complex queries.
       Since the database is not actually queried until you attempt to
       retrieve the data for an actual item, no time is wasted producing them.

	my $cheapfredbooks = $schema-&gtresultset('Author')-&gtfind({
	  Name =&gt 'Fred',
	})-&gtbooks-&gtsearch_related('prices', {
	  Price =&gt { '&lt=' =&gt '5.00' },
	});

       will produce a query something like:

	SELECT * FROM Author me
	LEFT JOIN Books books ON books.author = me.id
	LEFT JOIN Prices prices ON prices.book = books.id
	WHERE prices.Price &lt= 5.00

       all without needing multiple fetches.

       Only the helper methods for setting up standard relationship types are
       documented here. For the basic, lower-level methods, and a description
       of all the useful *_related methods that you get for free, see
       DBIx::Class::Relationship::Base.

METHODS
       All helper methods are called similar to the following template:

	 __PACKAGE__-&gt$method_name('relname', 'Foreign::Class', \%cond|\@cond|\&cond?, \%attrs?);

       Both "cond" and "attrs" are optional. Pass "undef" for "cond" if you
       want to use the default value for it, but still want to set "attrs".

       See "condition" in DBIx::Class::Relationship::Base for full
       documentation on definition of the "cond" argument.

       See "attributes" in DBIx::Class::Relationship::Base for documentation
       on the attributes that are allowed in the "attrs" argument.

   belongs_to
       Arguments: $accessor_name, $related_class,
       $our_fk_column|\%cond|\@cond|\$cond?, \%attrs?

       Creates a relationship where the calling class stores the foreign
       class's primary key in one (or more) of the calling class columns.
       This relationship defaults to using $accessor_name as the column name
       in this class to resolve the join against the primary key from
       $related_class, unless $our_fk_column specifies the foreign key column
       in this class or "cond" specifies a reference to a join condition.

       accessor_name
	   This argument is the name of the method you can call on a
	   DBIx::Class::Row object to retrieve the instance of the foreign
	   class matching this relationship. This is often called the
	   "relation(ship) name".

	   Use this accessor_name in "join" in DBIx::Class::ResultSet or
	   "prefetch" in DBIx::Class::ResultSet to join to the foreign table
	   indicated by this relationship.

       related_class
	   This is the class name of the table referenced by the foreign key
	   in this class.

       our_fk_column
	   The column name on this class that contains the foreign key.

	   OR

       cond
	   A hashref, arrayref or coderef specifying a custom join expression.
	   For more info see "condition" in DBIx::Class::Relationship.

	 # in a Book class (where Author has many Books)
	 My::DBIC::Schema::Book-&gtbelongs_to(
	   author =&gt
	   'My::DBIC::Schema::Author',
	   'author_id'
	 );

	 # OR (same result)
	 My::DBIC::Schema::Book-&gtbelongs_to(
	   author =&gt
	   'My::DBIC::Schema::Author',
	   { 'foreign.author_id' =&gt 'self.author_id' }
	 );

	 # OR (similar result but uglier accessor name)
	 My::DBIC::Schema::Book-&gtbelongs_to(
	   author_id =&gt
	   'My::DBIC::Schema::Author'
	 );

	 # Usage
	 my $author_obj = $book-&gtauthor; # get author object
	 $book-&gtauthor( $new_author_obj ); # set author object
	 $book-&gtauthor_id(); # get the plain id

	 # To retrieve the plain id if you used the ugly version:
	 $book-&gtget_column('author_id');

       If the relationship is optional -- i.e. the column containing the
       foreign key can be NULL -- then the belongs_to relationship does the
       right thing. Thus, in the example above "$obj-&gtauthor" would return
       "undef".  However in this case you would probably want to set the
       join_type attribute so that a "LEFT JOIN" is done, which makes complex
       resultsets involving "join" or "prefetch" operations work correctly.
       The modified declaration is shown below:

	 # in a Book class (where Author has_many Books)
	 __PACKAGE__-&gtbelongs_to(
	   author =&gt
	   'My::DBIC::Schema::Author',
	   'author',
	   { join_type =&gt 'left' }
	 );

       Cascading deletes are off by default on a "belongs_to" relationship. To
       turn them on, pass "cascade_delete =&gt 1" in the $attr hashref.

       By default, DBIC will return undef and avoid querying the database if a
       "belongs_to" accessor is called when any part of the foreign key IS
       NULL. To disable this behavior, pass "undef_on_null_fk =&gt 0" in the
       "\%attrs" hashref.

       NOTE: If you are used to Class::DBI relationships, this is the
       equivalent of "has_a".

       See "attributes" in DBIx::Class::Relationship::Base for documentation
       on relationship methods and valid relationship attributes. Also see
       DBIx::Class::ResultSet for a list of standard resultset attributes
       which can be assigned to relationships as well.

   has_many
       Arguments: $accessor_name, $related_class,
       $their_fk_column|\%cond|\@cond|\&cond?, \%attrs?

       Creates a one-to-many relationship where the foreign class refers to
       this class's primary key. This relationship refers to zero or more
       records in the foreign table (e.g. a "LEFT JOIN"). This relationship
       defaults to using the end of this classes namespace as the foreign key
       in $related_class to resolve the join, unless $their_fk_column
       specifies the foreign key column in $related_class or "cond" specifies
       a reference to a join condition.

       accessor_name
	   This argument is the name of the method you can call on a
	   DBIx::Class::Row object to retrieve a resultset of the related
	   class restricted to the ones related to the row object. In list
	   context it returns the row objects. This is often called the
	   "relation(ship) name".

	   Use this accessor_name in "join" in DBIx::Class::ResultSet or
	   "prefetch" in DBIx::Class::ResultSet to join to the foreign table
	   indicated by this relationship.

       related_class
	   This is the class name of the table which contains a foreign key
	   column containing PK values of this class.

       their_fk_column
	   The column name on the related class that contains the foreign key.

	   OR

       cond
	   A hashref, arrayref	or coderef specifying a custom join
	   expression. For more info see "condition" in
	   DBIx::Class::Relationship.

	 # in an Author class (where Author has_many Books)
	 # assuming related class is storing our PK in "author_id"
	 My::DBIC::Schema::Author-&gthas_many(
	   books =&gt
	   'My::DBIC::Schema::Book',
	   'author_id'
	 );

	 # OR (same result)
	 My::DBIC::Schema::Author-&gthas_many(
	   books =&gt
	   'My::DBIC::Schema::Book',
	   { 'foreign.author_id' =&gt 'self.id' },
	 );

	 # OR (similar result, assuming related_class is storing our PK, in "author")
	 # (the "author" is guessed at from "Author" in the class namespace)
	 My::DBIC::Schema::Author-&gthas_many(
	   books =&gt
	   'My::DBIC::Schema::Book',
	 );


	 # Usage
	 # resultset of Books belonging to author
	 my $booklist = $author-&gtbooks;

	 # resultset of Books belonging to author, restricted by author name
	 my $booklist = $author-&gtbooks({
	   name =&gt { LIKE =&gt '%macaroni%' },
	   { prefetch =&gt [qw/book/],
	 });

	 # array of Book objects belonging to author
	 my @book_objs = $author-&gtbooks;

	 # force resultset even in list context
	 my $books_rs = $author-&gtbooks;
	 ( $books_rs ) = $obj-&gtbooks_rs;

	 # create a new book for this author, the relation fields are auto-filled
	 $author-&gtcreate_related('books', \%col_data);
	 # alternative method for the above
	 $author-&gtadd_to_books(\%col_data);

       Three methods are created when you create a has_many relationship.  The
       first method is the expected accessor method, "$accessor_name()".  The
       second is almost exactly the same as the accessor method but "_rs" is
       added to the end of the method name, eg "$accessor_name_rs()".  This
       method works just like the normal accessor, except that it always
       returns a resultset, even in list context. The third method, named
       "add_to_$relname", will also be added to your Row items; this allows
       you to insert new related items, using the same mechanism as in
       "create_related" in DBIx::Class::Relationship::Base.

       If you delete an object in a class with a "has_many" relationship, all
       the related objects will be deleted as well.  To turn this behaviour
       off, pass "cascade_delete =&gt 0" in the $attr hashref.

       The cascaded operations are performed after the requested delete or
       update, so if your database has a constraint on the relationship, it
       will have deleted/updated the related records or raised an exception
       before DBIx::Class gets to perform the cascaded operation.

       If you copy an object in a class with a "has_many" relationship, all
       the related objects will be copied as well. To turn this behaviour off,
       pass "cascade_copy =&gt 0" in the $attr hashref. The behaviour defaults
       to "cascade_copy =&gt 1".

       See "attributes" in DBIx::Class::Relationship::Base for documentation
       on relationship methods and valid relationship attributes. Also see
       DBIx::Class::ResultSet for a list of standard resultset attributes
       which can be assigned to relationships as well.

   might_have
       Arguments: $accessor_name, $related_class,
       $their_fk_column|\%cond|\@cond|\&cond?, \%attrs?

       Creates an optional one-to-one relationship with a class. This
       relationship defaults to using $accessor_name as the foreign key in
       $related_class to resolve the join, unless $their_fk_column specifies
       the foreign key column in $related_class or "cond" specifies a
       reference to a join condition.

       accessor_name
	   This argument is the name of the method you can call on a
	   DBIx::Class::Row object to retrieve the instance of the foreign
	   class matching this relationship. This is often called the
	   "relation(ship) name".

	   Use this accessor_name in "join" in DBIx::Class::ResultSet or
	   "prefetch" in DBIx::Class::ResultSet to join to the foreign table
	   indicated by this relationship.

       related_class
	   This is the class name of the table which contains a foreign key
	   column containing PK values of this class.

       their_fk_column
	   The column name on the related class that contains the foreign key.

	   OR

       cond
	   A hashref, arrayref	or coderef specifying a custom join
	   expression. For more info see "condition" in
	   DBIx::Class::Relationship.

	 # Author may have an entry in the pseudonym table
	 My::DBIC::Schema::Author-&gtmight_have(
	   pseudonym =&gt
	   'My::DBIC::Schema::Pseudonym',
	   'author_id',
	 );

	 # OR (same result, assuming the related_class stores our PK)
	 My::DBIC::Schema::Author-&gtmight_have(
	   pseudonym =&gt
	   'My::DBIC::Schema::Pseudonym',
	 );

	 # OR (same result)
	 My::DBIC::Schema::Author-&gtmight_have(
	   pseudonym =&gt
	   'My::DBIC::Schema::Pseudonym',
	   { 'foreign.author_id' =&gt 'self.id' },
	 );

	 # Usage
	 my $pname = $author-&gtpseudonym; # to get the Pseudonym object

       If you update or delete an object in a class with a "might_have"
       relationship, the related object will be updated or deleted as well. To
       turn off this behavior, add "cascade_delete =&gt 0" to the $attr hashref.

       The cascaded operations are performed after the requested delete or
       update, so if your database has a constraint on the relationship, it
       will have deleted/updated the related records or raised an exception
       before DBIx::Class gets to perform the cascaded operation.

       See "attributes" in DBIx::Class::Relationship::Base for documentation
       on relationship methods and valid relationship attributes. Also see
       DBIx::Class::ResultSet for a list of standard resultset attributes
       which can be assigned to relationships as well.

       Note that if you supply a condition on which to join, and the column in
       the current table allows nulls (i.e., has the "is_nullable" attribute
       set to a true value), than "might_have" will warn about this because
       it's naughty and you shouldn't do that. The warning will look something
       like:

	 "might_have/has_one" must not be on columns with is_nullable set to true (MySchema::SomeClass/key)

       If you must be naughty, you can suppress the warning by setting
       "DBIC_DONT_VALIDATE_RELS" environment variable to a true value.
       Otherwise, you probably just meant to use
       "DBIx::Class::Relationship/belongs_to".

   has_one
       Arguments: $accessor_name, $related_class,
       $their_fk_column|\%cond|\@cond|\&cond?, \%attrs?

       Creates a one-to-one relationship with a class. This relationship
       defaults to using $accessor_name as the foreign key in $related_class
       to resolve the join, unless $their_fk_column specifies the foreign key
       column in $related_class or "cond" specifies a reference to a join
       condition.

       accessor_name
	   This argument is the name of the method you can call on a
	   DBIx::Class::Row object to retrieve the instance of the foreign
	   class matching this relationship. This is often called the
	   "relation(ship) name".

	   Use this accessor_name in "join" in DBIx::Class::ResultSet or
	   "prefetch" in DBIx::Class::ResultSet to join to the foreign table
	   indicated by this relationship.

       related_class
	   This is the class name of the table which contains a foreign key
	   column containing PK values of this class.

       their_fk_column
	   The column name on the related class that contains the foreign key.

	   OR

       cond
	   A hashref, arrayref	or coderef specifying a custom join
	   expression. For more info see "condition" in
	   DBIx::Class::Relationship.

	 # Every book has exactly one ISBN
	 My::DBIC::Schema::Book-&gthas_one(
	   isbn =&gt
	   'My::DBIC::Schema::ISBN',
	   'book_id',
	 );

	 # OR (same result, assuming related_class stores our PK)
	 My::DBIC::Schema::Book-&gthas_one(
	   isbn =&gt
	   'My::DBIC::Schema::ISBN',
	 );

	 # OR (same result)
	 My::DBIC::Schema::Book-&gthas_one(
	   isbn =&gt
	   'My::DBIC::Schema::ISBN',
	   { 'foreign.book_id' =&gt 'self.id' },
	 );

	 # Usage
	 my $isbn_obj = $book-&gtisbn; # to get the ISBN object

       Creates a one-to-one relationship with another class. This is just like
       "might_have", except the implication is that the other object is always
       present. The only difference between "has_one" and "might_have" is that
       "has_one" uses an (ordinary) inner join, whereas "might_have" defaults
       to a left join.

       The has_one relationship should be used when a row in the table must
       have exactly one related row in another table. If the related row might
       not exist in the foreign table, use the "might_have" in
       DBIx::Class::Relationship relationship.

       In the above example, each Book in the database is associated with
       exactly one ISBN object.

       See "attributes" in DBIx::Class::Relationship::Base for documentation
       on relationship methods and valid relationship attributes. Also see
       DBIx::Class::ResultSet for a list of standard resultset attributes
       which can be assigned to relationships as well.

       Note that if you supply a condition on which to join, if the column in
       the current table allows nulls (i.e., has the "is_nullable" attribute
       set to a true value), than warnings might apply just as with
       "might_have" in DBIx::Class::Relationship.

   many_to_many
       Arguments: $accessor_name, $link_rel_name, $foreign_rel_name, \%attrs?

       "many_to_many" is a Relationship bridge which has a specific meaning in
       DBIx::Class, see the definition in the Glossary.

       "many_to_many" is not strictly a relationship in its own right.
       Instead, it is a bridge between two resultsets which provide the same
       kind of convenience accessors as true relationships provide. Although
       the accessor will return a resultset or collection of objects just like
       has_many does, you cannot call "related_resultset" and similar methods
       which operate on true relationships.

       accessor_name
	   This argument is the name of the method you can call on a
	   DBIx::Class::Row object to retrieve the rows matching this
	   relationship.

	   On a many_to_many, unlike other relationships, this cannot be used
	   in "search" in DBIx::Class::ResultSet to join tables. Use the
	   relations bridged across instead.

       link_rel_name
	   This is the accessor_name from the has_many relationship we are
	   bridging from.

       foreign_rel_name
	   This is the accessor_name of the belongs_to relationship in the
	   link table that we are bridging across (which gives us the table we
	   are bridging to).

       To create a many_to_many relationship from Actor to Role:

	 My::DBIC::Schema::Actor-&gthas_many( actor_roles =&gt
					    'My::DBIC::Schema::ActorRoles',
					    'actor' );
	 My::DBIC::Schema::ActorRoles-&gtbelongs_to( role =&gt
						   'My::DBIC::Schema::Role' );
	 My::DBIC::Schema::ActorRoles-&gtbelongs_to( actor =&gt
						   'My::DBIC::Schema::Actor' );

	 My::DBIC::Schema::Actor-&gtmany_to_many( roles =&gt 'actor_roles',
						'role' );

       And, for the reverse relationship, from Role to Actor:

	 My::DBIC::Schema::Role-&gthas_many( actor_roles =&gt
					   'My::DBIC::Schema::ActorRoles',
					   'role' );

	 My::DBIC::Schema::Role-&gtmany_to_many( actors =&gt 'actor_roles', 'actor' );

       To add a role for your actor, and fill in the year of the role in the
       actor_roles table:

	 $actor-&gtadd_to_roles($role, { year =&gt 1995 });

       In the above example, ActorRoles is the link table class, and Role is
       the foreign class. The $link_rel_name parameter is the name of the
       accessor for the has_many relationship from this table to the link
       table, and the $foreign_rel_name parameter is the accessor for the
       belongs_to relationship from the link table to the foreign table.

       To use many_to_many, existing relationships from the original table to
       the link table, and from the link table to the end table must already
       exist, these relation names are then used in the many_to_many call.

       In the above example, the Actor class will have 3 many_to_many accessor
       methods set: "roles", "add_to_roles", "set_roles", and similarly named
       accessors will be created for the Role class for the "actors"
       many_to_many relationship.

       See "attributes" in DBIx::Class::Relationship::Base for documentation
       on relationship methods and valid relationship attributes. Also see
       DBIx::Class::ResultSet for a list of standard resultset attributes
       which can be assigned to relationships as well.
