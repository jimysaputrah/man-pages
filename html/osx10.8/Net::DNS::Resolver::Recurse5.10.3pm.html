NAME
       Net::DNS::Resolver::Recurse - Perform recursive dns lookups

SYNOPSIS
	 use Net::DNS::Resolver::Recurse;
	 my $res = Net::DNS::Resolver::Recurse-&gtnew;

DESCRIPTION
       This module is a sub class of Net::DNS::Resolver. So the methods for
       Net::DNS::Resolver still work for this module as well.  There are just
       a couple methods added:

   hints
       Initialize the hint servers.  Recursive queries need a starting name
       server to work off of. This method takes a list of IP addresses to use
       as the starting servers.  These name servers should be authoritative
       for the root (.) zone.

	 $res-&gthints(@ips);

       If no hints are passed, the default nameserver is asked for the hints.
       Normally these IPs can be obtained from the following location:

	 ftp://ftp.internic.net/domain/named.root

   recursion_callback
       This method is takes a code reference, which is then invoked each time
       a packet is received during the recursive lookup.  For example to
       emulate dig's "+trace" function:

	$res-&gtrecursion_callback(sub {
	    my $packet = shift;

	    $_-&gtprint for $packet-&gtadditional;

	    printf(";; Received %d bytes from %s\n\n",
		$packet-&gtanswersize,
		$packet-&gtanswerfrom
	    );
	});

   query_dorecursion
       This method is much like the normal query() method except it disables
       the recurse flag in the packet and explicitly performs the recursion.

	 $packet = $res-&gtquery_dorecursion( "www.netscape.com.", "A");

IPv6 transport
       If the appropriate IPv6 libraries are installed the recursive resolver
       will randomly choose between IPv6 and IPv4 addresses of the nameservers
       it encounters during recursion.

       If you want to force IPv4 transport use the force_v4() method. Also see
       the IPv6 transport notes in the Net::DNS::Resolver documentation.
