Devel::Caller(3)      User Contributed Perl Documentation     Devel::Caller(3)



NAME
       Devel::Caller - meatier versions of "caller"

SYNOPSIS
	use Devel::Caller qw(caller_cv);
	$foo = sub { print "huzzah\n" if $foo == caller_cv(0) };
	$foo-&gt();  # prints huzzah

	use Devel::Caller qw(called_with);
	sub foo { print called_with(0,1); }
	foo( my @foo ); # should print '@foo'

DESCRIPTION
       caller_cv($level)
	   "caller_cv" gives you the coderef of the subroutine being invoked
	   at the call frame indicated by the value of $level

       caller_args($level)
	   Returns the arguments passed into the caller at level $level

       caller_vars( $level, $names ) =item called_with($level, $names)
	   "called_with" returns a list of references to the original
	   arguments to the subroutine at $level.  if $names is true, the
	   names of the variables will be returned instead

	   constants are returned as "undef" in both cases

       called_as_method($level)
	   "called_as_method" returns true if the subroutine at $level was
	   called as a method.

BUGS
       All of these routines are susceptible to the same limitations as
       "caller" as described in "caller" in perlfunc

       The deparsing of the optree perfomed by called_with is fairly simple-
       minded and so a bit flaky.

       o   As a version 2.0 of Devel::Caller we no longer maintain
	   compatibility with versions of perl earlier than 5.8.2.  Older
	   versions continue to be available from CPAN and backpan.
