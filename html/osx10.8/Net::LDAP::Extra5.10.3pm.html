NAME
       Net::LDAP::Extra -- Load extra Net::LDAP methods

SYNOPSIS
	 use Net::LDAP::Extra qw(my_extn);

	 $ldap = Net::LDAP->new( ... );

	 $ldap->my_extn( ... );

DESCRIPTION
       "Net::LDAP::Extra" allows extra methods to be added to Net::LDAP.
       Normally such methods would be added by sub-classing Net::LDAP, but
       this proves to get messy as different people write different additions
       and others want to use multiple of these sub-classes. Users end up
       having to create sub-classes of their own which inherit from all the
       extension sub-classes just so they can get all the features.

       "Net::LDAP::Extra" allows methods to be added directly to all Net::LDAP
       objects. This can be done by creating a class "Net::LDAP::Extra::name"
       which exports functions. A "use Net::LDAP::Extra qw(name)" will then
       make these functions avaliable as a methods on all "Net::LDAP" objects.

       Care should be taken when choosing names for the functions to export to
       ensure that they do not clash with others.
