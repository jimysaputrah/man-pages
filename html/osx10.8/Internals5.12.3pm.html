SYNOPSIS
	 use Internals qw(IsWriteProtected SetReadOnly SetReadWrite GetRefCount SetRefCount);

	 use Internals qw(:all);

	 $object = My::Class->new(@parameters);

	 SetReadOnly($object);

	 SetReadWrite($object);

	 if (IsWriteProtected($object)) { ... }

	 $value = GetRefCount($object);

	 SetRefCount($object,$value);

       or

	 package My::Class;

	 use Internals;

	 @ISA = qw(Internals);

	 $object = My::Class->new(@parameters)->SetReadOnly();

	 $object->SetReadWrite();

	 if ($object->IsWriteProtected()) { ... }

	 $value = $object->GetRefCount();

	 $object->SetRefCount($value);

       or

	 use Internals qw(IsWriteProtected SetReadOnly SetReadWrite GetRefCount SetRefCount);

	 use Internals qw(:all);

	 SetReadOnly(\$scalar);

	 SetReadOnly(\@array);

	 SetReadOnly(\%hash);

	 SetReadOnly(\$hash{$element});

	 SetReadOnly(\$reference);

       etc.

DESCRIPTION
       This module allows you to write-protect and write-enable your Perl
       variables, objects and data structures.

       Moreover, the reference count of any Perl variable can be read and set.

       You can never pass the object directly on which to perform the desired
       action, you always have to pass a reference to the variable or data
       structure in question.

       This comes in handy for objects and anonymous data structures, where
       you only have a reference anyway!

       BEWARE: This module is DANGEROUS!

       DO NOT attempt to unlock Perl's built-in variables!

       DO NOT manipulate reference counts unless you know exactly what you're
       doing!

       ANYTHING might happen! Hell might break loose! ":-)"

       YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!
