NAME
       Apache::TestUtil - Utility functions for writing tests

SYNOPSIS
	 use Apache::Test;
	 use Apache::TestUtil;

	 ok t_cmp("foo", "foo", "sanity check");
	 t_write_file("filename", @content);
	 my $fh = t_open_file($filename);
	 t_mkdir("/foo/bar");
	 t_rmtree("/foo/bar");
	 t_is_equal($a, $b);

DESCRIPTION
       "Apache::TestUtil" automatically exports a number of functions useful
       in writing tests.

       All the files and directories created using the functions from this
       package will be automatically destroyed at the end of the program
       execution (via END block). You should not use these functions other
       than from within tests which should cleanup all the created directories
       and files at the end of the test.

FUNCTIONS
       t_cmp()
	     t_cmp($received, $expected, $comment);

	   t_cmp() prints the values of $comment, $expected and $received.
	   e.g.:

	     t_cmp(1, 1, "1 == 1?");

	   prints:

	     # testing : 1 == 1?
	     # expected: 1
	     # received: 1

	   then it returns the result of comparison of the $expected and the
	   $received variables. Usually, the return value of this function is
	   fed directly to the ok() function, like this:

	     ok t_cmp(1, 1, "1 == 1?");

	   the third argument ($comment) is optional, mostly useful for
	   telling what the comparison is trying to do.

	   It is valid to use "undef" as an expected value. Therefore:

	     my $foo;
	     t_cmp(undef, $foo, "undef == undef?");

	   will return a true value.

	   You can compare any two data-structures with t_cmp(). Just make
	   sure that if you pass non-scalars, you have to pass their
	   references. The datastructures can be deeply nested. For example
	   you can compare:

	     t_cmp({1 => [2..3,{5..8}], 4 => [5..6]},
		   {1 => [2..3,{5..8}], 4 => [5..6]},
		   "hash of array of hashes");

	   You can also compare the second argument against the first as a
	   regex. Use the "qr//" function in the second argument. For example:

	     t_cmp("abcd", qr/^abc/, "regex compare");

	   will do:

	     "abcd" =~ /^abc/;

	   This function is exported by default.

       t_filepath_cmp()
	   This function is used to compare two filepaths via t_cmp().	For
	   non-Win32, it simply uses t_cmp() for the comparison, but for
	   Win32, Win32::GetLongPathName() is invoked to convert the first two
	   arguments to their DOS long pathname. This is useful when there is
	   a possibility the two paths being compared are not both represented
	   by their long or short pathname.

	   This function is exported by default.

       t_debug()
	     t_debug("testing feature foo");
	     t_debug("test", [1..3], 5, {a=>[1..5]});

	   t_debug() prints out any datastructure while prepending "#" at the
	   beginning of each line, to make the debug printouts comply with
	   "Test::Harness"'s requirements. This function should be always used
	   for debug prints, since if in the future the debug printing will
	   change (e.g. redirected into a file) your tests won't need to be
	   changed.

	   the special global variable $Apache::TestUtil::DEBUG_OUTPUT can be
	   used to redirect the output from t_debug() and related calls such
	   as t_write_file().  for example, from a server-side test you would
	   probably need to redirect it to STDERR:

	     sub handler {
	       plan $r, tests => 1;

	       local $Apache::TestUtil::DEBUG_OUTPUT = \*STDERR;

	       t_write_file('/tmp/foo', 'bar');
	       ...
	     }

	   left to its own devices, t_debug() will collide with the standard
	   HTTP protocol during server-side tests, resulting in a situation
	   both confusing difficult to debug.  but STDOUT is left as the
	   default, since you probably don't want debug output under normal
	   circumstances unless running under verbose mode.

	   This function is exported by default.

       t_write_test_lib()
	     t_write_test_lib($filename, @lines)

	   t_write_test_lib() creates a new file at $filename or overwrites
	   the existing file with the content passed in @lines.  The file is
	   created in a temporary directory which is added to @INC at test
	   configuration time.	It is intended to be used for creating
	   temporary packages for testing which can be modified at run time,
	   see the Apache::Reload unit tests for an example.

       t_write_file()
	     t_write_file($filename, @lines);

	   t_write_file() creates a new file at $filename or overwrites the
	   existing file with the content passed in @lines. If only the
	   $filename is passed, an empty file will be created.

	   If parent directories of $filename don't exist they will be
	   automagically created.

	   The generated file will be automatically deleted at the end of the
	   program's execution.

	   This function is exported by default.

       t_append_file()
	     t_append_file($filename, @lines);

	   t_append_file() is similar to t_write_file(), but it doesn't
	   clobber existing files and appends @lines to the end of the file.
	   If the file doesn't exist it will create it.

	   If parent directories of $filename don't exist they will be
	   automagically created.

	   The generated file will be registered to be automatically deleted
	   at the end of the program's execution, only if the file was created
	   by t_append_file().

	   This function is exported by default.

       t_write_shell_script()
	     Apache::TestUtil::t_write_shell_script($filename, @lines);

	   Similar to t_write_file() but creates a portable shell/batch
	   script. The created filename is constructed from $filename and an
	   appropriate extension automatically selected according to the
	   platform the code is running under.

	   It returns the extension of the created file.

       t_write_perl_script()
	     Apache::TestUtil::t_write_perl_script($filename, @lines);

	   Similar to t_write_file() but creates a executable Perl script with
	   correctly set shebang line.

       t_open_file()
	     my $fh = t_open_file($filename);

	   t_open_file() opens a file $filename for writing and returns the
	   file handle to the opened file.

	   If parent directories of $filename don't exist they will be
	   automagically created.

	   The generated file will be automatically deleted at the end of the
	   program's execution.

	   This function is exported by default.

       t_mkdir()
	     t_mkdir($dirname);

	   t_mkdir() creates a directory $dirname. The operation will fail if
	   the parent directory doesn't exist.

	   If parent directories of $dirname don't exist they will be
	   automagically created.

	   The generated directory will be automatically deleted at the end of
	   the program's execution.

	   This function is exported by default.

       t_rmtree()
	     t_rmtree(@dirs);

	   t_rmtree() deletes the whole directories trees passed in @dirs.

	   This function is exported by default.

       t_chown()
	     Apache::TestUtil::t_chown($file);

	   Change ownership of $file to the test's User/Group.	This function
	   is noop on platforms where chown(2) is unsupported (e.g. Win32).

       t_is_equal()
	     t_is_equal($a, $b);

	   t_is_equal() compares any two datastructures and returns 1 if they
	   are exactly the same, otherwise 0. The datastructures can be nested
	   hashes, arrays, scalars, undefs or a combination of any of these.
	   See t_cmp() for an example.

	   If $b is a regex reference, the regex comparison "$a =~ $b" is
	   performed. For example:

	     t_is_equal($server_version, qr{^Apache});

	   If comparing non-scalars make sure to pass the references to the
	   datastructures.

	   This function is exported by default.

       t_server_log_error_is_expected()
	   If the handler's execution results in an error or a warning logged
	   to the error_log file which is expected, it's a good idea to have a
	   disclaimer printed before the error itself, so one can tell real
	   problems with tests from expected errors. For example when testing
	   how the package behaves under error conditions the error_log file
	   might be loaded with errors, most of which are expected.

	   For example if a handler is about to generate a run-time error,
	   this function can be used as:

	     use Apache::TestUtil;
	     ...
	     sub handler {
		 my $r = shift;
		 ...
		 t_server_log_error_is_expected();
		 die "failed because ...";
	     }

	   After running this handler the error_log file will include:

	     *** The following error entry is expected and harmless ***
	     [Tue Apr 01 14:00:21 2003] [error] failed because ...

	   When more than one entry is expected, an optional numerical
	   argument, indicating how many entries to expect, can be passed. For
	   example:

	     t_server_log_error_is_expected(2);

	   will generate:

	     *** The following 2 error entries are expected and harmless ***

	   If the error is generated at compile time, the logging must be done
	   in the BEGIN block at the very beginning of the file:

	     BEGIN {
		 use Apache::TestUtil;
		 t_server_log_error_is_expected();
	     }
	     use DOES_NOT_exist;

	   After attempting to run this handler the error_log file will
	   include:

	     *** The following error entry is expected and harmless ***
	     [Tue Apr 01 14:04:49 2003] [error] Can't locate "DOES_NOT_exist.pm"
	     in @INC (@INC contains: ...

	   Also see "t_server_log_warn_is_expected()" which is similar but
	   used for warnings.

	   This function is exported by default.

       t_server_log_warn_is_expected()
	   "t_server_log_warn_is_expected()" generates a disclaimer for
	   expected warnings.

	   See the explanation for "t_server_log_error_is_expected()" for more
	   details.

	   This function is exported by default.

       t_client_log_error_is_expected()
	   "t_client_log_error_is_expected()" generates a disclaimer for
	   expected errors. But in contrast to
	   "t_server_log_error_is_expected()" called by the client side of the
	   script.

	   See the explanation for "t_server_log_error_is_expected()" for more
	   details.

	   For example the following client script fails to find the handler:

	     use Apache::Test;
	     use Apache::TestUtil;
	     use Apache::TestRequest qw(GET);

	     plan tests => 1;

	     t_client_log_error_is_expected();
	     my $url = "/error_document/cannot_be_found";
	     my $res = GET($url);
	     ok t_cmp(404, $res->code, "test 404");

	   After running this test the error_log file will include an entry
	   similar to the following snippet:

	     *** The following error entry is expected and harmless ***
	     [Tue Apr 01 14:02:55 2003] [error] [client 127.0.0.1]
	     File does not exist: /tmp/test/t/htdocs/error

	   When more than one entry is expected, an optional numerical
	   argument, indicating how many entries to expect, can be passed. For
	   example:

	     t_client_log_error_is_expected(2);

	   will generate:

	     *** The following 2 error entries are expected and harmless ***

	   This function is exported by default.

       t_client_log_warn_is_expected()
	   "t_client_log_warn_is_expected()" generates a disclaimer for
	   expected warnings on the client side.

	   See the explanation for "t_client_log_error_is_expected()" for more
	   details.

	   This function is exported by default.

       t_catfile('a', 'b', 'c')
	   This function is essentially "File::Spec->catfile", but on Win32
	   will use "Win32::GetLongpathName()" to convert the result to a long
	   path name (if the result is an absolute file).  The function is not
	   exported by default.

       t_catfile_apache('a', 'b', 'c')
	   This function is essentially "File::Spec::Unix->catfile", but on
	   Win32 will use "Win32::GetLongpathName()" to convert the result to
	   a long path name (if the result is an absolute file).  It is useful
	   when comparing something to that returned by Apache, which uses a
	   Unix-style specification with forward slashes for directory
	   separators. The function is not exported by default.

       t_start_error_log_watch(), t_finish_error_log_watch()
	   This pair of functions provides an easy interface for checking the
	   presence or absense of any particular message or messages in the
	   httpd error_log that were generated by the httpd daemon as part of
	   a test suite.  It is likely, that you should proceed this with a
	   call to one of the t_*_is_expected() functions.

	     t_start_error_log_watch();
	     do_it;
	     ok grep {...} t_finish_error_log_watch();

	   Another usage case could be a handler that emits some debugging
	   messages to the error_log. Now, if this handler is called in a
	   series of other test cases it can be hard to find the relevant
	   messages manually. In such cases the following sequence in the test
	   file may help:

	     t_start_error_log_watch();
	     GET '/this/or/that';
	     t_debug t_finish_error_log_watch();

       t_start_file_watch()
	     Apache::TestUtil::t_start_file_watch('access_log');

	   This function is similar to "t_start_error_log_watch()" but allows
	   for other files than "error_log" to be watched. It opens the given
	   file and positions the file pointer at its end. Subsequent calls to
	   "t_read_file_watch()" or "t_finish_file_watch()" will read lines
	   that have been appended after this call.

	   A file name can be passed as parameter. If omitted or undefined the
	   "error_log" is opened. Relative file name are evaluated relative to
	   the directory containing "error_log".

	   If the specified file does not exist (yet) no error is returned. It
	   is assumed that it will appear soon. In this case
	   "t_{read,finish}_file_watch()" will open the file silently and read
	   from the beginning.

       t_read_file_watch(), t_finish_file_watch()
	     local $/ = "\n";
	     $line1=Apache::TestUtil::t_read_file_watch('access_log');
	     $line2=Apache::TestUtil::t_read_file_watch('access_log');

	     @lines=Apache::TestUtil::t_finish_file_watch('access_log');

	   This pair of functions reads the file opened by
	   "t_start_error_log_watch()".

	   As does the core "readline" function, they return one line if
	   called in scalar context, otherwise all lines until end of file.

	   Before calling "readline" these functions do not set $/ as does
	   "t_finish_error_log_watch". So, if the file has for example a fixed
	   record length use this:

	     {
	       local $/=\$record_length;
	       @lines=t_finish_file_watch($name);
	     }
