GETAUDIT_ADDR(2)	    BSD System Calls Manual	      GETAUDIT_ADDR(2)

NAME
     getaudit_addr, getaudit(NOW DEPRECATED) -- retrieve audit session state

SYNOPSIS
     #include <bsm/audit.h>
     #include <bsm/audit_session.h>

     int
     getaudit_addr(auditinfo_addr_t *auditinfo_addr, u_int length);

SYNOPSIS (NOW DEPRECATED)
     #include <bsm/audit.h>

     int
     getaudit(auditinfo_t *auditinfo);

DESCRIPTION
     The getaudit_addr() system call retrieves extended state via
     auditinfo_addr and length.  It uses the auditinfo_addr_t data structure
     supports Terminal IDs incuding those with larger addresses such as those
     used in IP version 6.  It is defined as follows:
	 struct auditinfo_addr {
	      au_id_t	      ai_auid;	      /* Audit user ID. */
	      au_mask_t       ai_mask;	      /* Audit masks. */
	      au_tid_addr_t   ai_termid;      /* Terminal ID. */
	      au_asid_t       ai_asid;	      /* Audit session ID. */
	      u_int64_t       ai_flags;       /* Audit session flags. */
	 };
	 typedef struct auditinfo_addr	 auditinfo_addr_t;

     The ai_auid variable contains the audit identifier which is recorded in
     the audit log for each event the process caused.

     The au_mask_t data structure defines the bit mask for auditing successful
     and failed events out of the predefined list of event classes. It is
     defined as follows:
	 struct au_mask {
	      unsigned int    am_success;     /* success bits */
	      unsigned int    am_failure;     /* failure bits */
	 };
	 typedef struct au_mask  au_mask_t;

     The au_tid_addr_t data structure which includes a larger address storage
     field and an additional field with the type of address stored:
	 struct au_tid_addr {
	      dev_t	      at_port;
	      u_int32_t       at_type;
	      u_int32_t       at_addr[4];
	 };
	 typedef struct au_tid_addr	 au_tid_addr_t;

     The ai_asid variable contains the audit session ID which is recorded with
     every event caused by the process.

     The ai_flags variable contains flags that are opaque to the kernel and
     used by various consumers of the auditinfo_addr data.  Please see the
     <bsm/audit_session.h> header file for more information and flag defini-
     tions for this platform.

     Without appropriate privilege the audit mask fields will be set to all
     ones.

     The getaudit() system call (NOW DEPRECATED) retrieves the active audit
     session state for the current process via the auditinfo_t pointed to by
     auditinfo.

     The auditinfo_t data structure (NOW DEPRECATED) is defined as follows:
	 struct auditinfo {
	      au_id_t	     ai_auid;	      /* Audit user ID */
	      au_mask_t      ai_mask;	      /* Audit masks */
	      au_tid_t	     ai_termid;       /* Terminal ID */
	      au_asid_t      ai_asid;	      /* Audit session ID */
	 };
	 typedef struct auditinfo	 auditinfo_t;

     The au_termid_t data structure (NOW DEPRECATED) defines the Terminal ID
     recorded with every event caused by the process. It is defined as fol-
     lows:
	 struct au_tid {
	      dev_t	      port;
	      u_int32_t       machine;
	 };
	 typedef struct au_tid	 au_tid_t;

RETURN VALUES
     The getaudit_addr() function returns the value 0 if successful; otherwise
     the value -1 is returned and the global variable errno is set to indicate
     the error.

ERRORS
     The getaudit_addr() function will fail if:

     [EFAULT]		A failure occurred while data transferred to or from
			the kernel failed.

     [EINVAL]		Illegal argument was passed by a system call.

     [EOVERFLOW]	The length argument indicates an overflow condition
			will occur.

     [ERANGE]		The address is too big.

HISTORY
     The OpenBSM implementation was created by McAfee Research, the security
     division of McAfee Inc., under contract to Apple Computer Inc. in 2004.
     It was subsequently adopted by the TrustedBSD Project as the foundation
     for the OpenBSM distribution.

     getaudit_addr() replaced getaudit() in Mac OS X 10.7 to support longer
     terminal addresses such as those used by IP version 6.  getaudit() is now
     deprecated and getaudit_addr() should be used instead.

AUTHORS
     This software was created by McAfee Research, the security research divi-
     sion of McAfee, Inc., under contract to Apple Computer Inc.  Additional
     authors include Wayne Salamon, Robert Watson, and SPARTA Inc.

     The Basic Security Module (BSM) interface to audit records and audit
     event stream format were defined by Sun Microsystems.
