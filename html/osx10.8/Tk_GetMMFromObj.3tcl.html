Tk_GetPixelsFromObj(3)	     Tk Library Procedures	Tk_GetPixelsFromObj(3)



______________________________________________________________________________

NAME
       Tk_GetPixelsFromObj,  Tk_GetPixels,  Tk_GetMMFromObj,  Tk_GetScreenMM -
       translate between strings and screen units

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lttk.h&gt

       int
       Tk_GetPixelsFromObj(interp, tkwin, objPtr, intPtr)

       int
       Tk_GetPixels(interp, tkwin, string, intPtr)

       int
       Tk_GetMMFromObj(interp, tkwin, objPtr, doublePtr)

       int
       Tk_GetScreenMM(interp, tkwin, string, doublePtr)

ARGUMENTS
       Tcl_Interp *interp (in)		 Interpreter to use for error  report-
					 ing.

       Tk_Window tkwin (in)		 Window  whose	screen geometry deter-
					 mines the conversion between absolute
					 units and pixels.

       Tcl_Obj *objPtr (in/out) 	 String  value specifies a distance on
					 the screen; internal rep will be mod-
					 ified to cache converted distance.

       const char *string (in)		 Same  as  objPtr except specification
					 of distance is passed as a string.

       int *intPtr (out)		 Pointer to location in which to store
					 converted distance in pixels.

       double *doublePtr (out)		 Pointer to location in which to store
					 converted distance in millimeters.

DESCRIPTION
       These procedures take as argument a specification of  distance  on  the
       screen (objPtr or string) and compute the corresponding distance either
       in integer pixels  or  floating-point  millimeters.   In  either  case,
       objPtr or string specifies a screen distance as a floating-point number
       followed by one of the following characters that indicates units:

       &ltnone&gt The number specifies a distance in pixels.

       c      The number specifies a distance in centimeters on the screen.

       i      The number specifies a distance in inches on the screen.

       m      The number specifies a distance in millimeters on the screen.

       p      The number specifies a distance in printer's points (1/72  inch)
	      on the screen.

       Tk_GetPixelsFromObj  converts  the  value of objPtr to the nearest even
       number of pixels and stores that value at *intPtr.  It  returns	TCL_OK
       under normal circumstances.  If an error occurs (e.g. objPtr contains a
       number followed by a character that is not one of the ones above)  then
       TCL_ERROR  is  returned and an error message is left in interp's result
       if interp is not NULL.  Tk_GetPixelsFromObj  caches  information  about
       the  return value in objPtr, which speeds up future calls to Tk_GetPix-
       elsFromObj with the same objPtr.

       Tk_GetPixels is identical to Tk_GetPixelsFromObj except that the screen
       distance  is  specified	with a string instead of an object.  This pre-
       vents Tk_GetPixels from caching the return value,  so  Tk_GetAnchor  is
       less efficient than Tk_GetPixelsFromObj.

       Tk_GetMMFromObj	and  Tk_GetScreenMM are similar to Tk_GetPixelsFromObj
       and Tk_GetPixels (respectively) except that  they  convert  the	screen
       distance  to  millimeters  and  store a double-precision floating-point
       result at *doublePtr.


KEYWORDS
