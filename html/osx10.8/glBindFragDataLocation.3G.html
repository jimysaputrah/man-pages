NAME
       glBindFragDataLocation - bind a user-defined varying out variable to a
       fragment shader color number

C SPECIFICATION
       void glBindFragDataLocation(GLuint program, GLuint colorNumber,
				   const char * name);

PARAMETERS
       program
	   The name of the program containing varying out variable whose
	   binding to modify

       colorNumber
	   The color number to bind the user-defined varying out variable to

       name
	   The name of the user-defined varying out variable whose binding to
	   modify

DESCRIPTION
       glBindFragDataLocation explicitly specifies the binding of the
       user-defined varying out variable name to fragment shader color number
       colorNumber for program program. If name was bound previously, its
       assigned binding is replaced with colorNumber.  name must be a
       null-terminated string.	colorNumber must be less than
       GL_MAX_DRAW_BUFFERS.

       The bindings specified by glBindFragDataLocation have no effect until
       program is next linked. Bindings may be specified at any time after
       program has been created. Specifically, they may be specified before
       shader objects are attached to the program. Therefore, any name may be
       specified in name, including a name that is never used as a varying out
       variable in any fragment shader object. Names beginning with gl_ are
       reserved by the GL.

       In addition to the errors generated by glBindFragDataLocation, the
       program program will fail to link if:

       o   The number of active outputs is greater than the value
	   GL_MAX_DRAW_BUFFERS.

       o   More than one varying out variable is bound to the same color
	   number.


NOTES
       Varying out varyings may have indexed locations assigned explicitly in
       the shader text using a location layout qualifier. If a shader
       statically assigns a location to a varying out variable in the shader
       text, that location is used and any location assigned with
       glBindFragDataLocation is ignored.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if colorNumber is greater than or equal
       to GL_MAX_DRAW_BUFFERS.


       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if name starts with the reserved gl_
       prefix.


       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if program is not the name of a
       program object.

ASSOCIATED GETS
       glGetFragDataLocation() with a valid program object and the the name of
       a user-defined varying out variable
