NAME
       gluBeginPolygon, gluEndPolygon - delimit a polygon description


C SPECIFICATION
       void gluBeginPolygon( GLUtesselator* tess )

       void gluEndPolygon( GLUtesselator* tess )


PARAMETERS
       tess  Specifies the tessellation object (created with gluNewTess).

DESCRIPTION
       gluBeginPolygon and gluEndPolygon delimit the definition of a nonconvex
       polygon.  To define such a polygon, first call  gluBeginPolygon.   Then
       define  the  contours  of the polygon by calling gluTessVertex for each
       vertex and gluNextContour to start each	new  contour.	Finally,  call
       gluEndPolygon   to   signal   the  end  of  the	definition.   See  the
       gluTessVertex and gluNextContour reference pages for more details.

       Once gluEndPolygon is called,  the  polygon  is	tessellated,  and  the
       resulting    triangles	 are   described   through   callbacks.    See
       gluTessCallback for descriptions of the callback functions.

NOTES
       This command is obsolete and is	provided  for  backward  compatibility
       only.  Calls  to gluBeginPolygon are mapped to gluTessBeginPolygon fol-
       lowed by gluTessBeginContour. Calls  to	gluEndPolygon  are  mapped  to
       gluTessEndContour followed by gluTessEndPolygon.

EXAMPLE
       A  quadrilateral  with  a  triangular  hole in it can be described like
       this:

       gluBeginPolygon(tobj);
	  gluTessVertex(tobj, v1, v1);
	  gluTessVertex(tobj, v2, v2);
	  gluTessVertex(tobj, v3, v3);
	  gluTessVertex(tobj, v4, v4); gluNextContour(tobj, GLU_INTERIOR);
	  gluTessVertex(tobj, v5, v5);
	  gluTessVertex(tobj, v6, v6);
	  gluTessVertex(tobj, v7, v7); gluEndPolygon(tobj);
