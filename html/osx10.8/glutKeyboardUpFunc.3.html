NAME
       glutKeyboardUpFunc  -  sets  the keyboard up (key release) callback for
       the current window.

SYNTAX
       #include &ltGLUT/glut.h&gt

       void glutKeyboardUpFunc(void (*func)(unsigned char key,
			     int x, int y));

ARGUMENTS
       func	 The new keyboard up callback function.

DESCRIPTION
       glutKeyboardFunc sets the keyboard up (key release)  callback  for  the
       current	window.   When	a user types into the window, each key release
       matching an ASCII character will generate a keyboard up	callback.  The
       key  callback  parameter is the generated ASCII character. The state of
       modifier keys such as Shift cannot be determined directly;  their  only
       effect will be on the returned ASCII data. The x and y callback parame-
       ters indicate the mouse location in window  relative  coordinates  when
       the key was pressed. When a new window is created, no keyboard callback
       is initially registered, and  ASCII  key  strokes  in  the  window  are
       ignored.  Passing  NULL	to glutKeyboardFunc disables the generation of
       keyboard callbacks.

       During a keyboard up callback, glutGetModifiers may be called to deter-
       mine the state of modifier keys when the keystroke generating the call-
       back occurred.

       To avoid the reporting of key release/press pairs due to  auto  repeat,
       use glutIgnoreKeyRepeat to ignore auto repeated keystrokes.

       There  is  no guarantee that the keyboard press callback will match the
       exact ASCII character as the keyboard up callback.   For  example,  the
       key  down  may  be for a lowercase b, but the key release may report an
       uppercase B if the shift state has changed.  The same applies  to  sym-
       bols  and  control  characters.	 The precise behavior is window system
       dependent.

       Use glutSpecialUpFunc for a means to detect non-ASCII key releases.
