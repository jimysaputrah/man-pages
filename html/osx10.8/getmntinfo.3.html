GETMNTINFO(3)		 BSD Library Functions Manual		 GETMNTINFO(3)

NAME
     getmntinfo getmntinfo64 -- get information about mounted file systems

SYNOPSIS
     #include &ltsys/param.h&gt
     #include &ltsys/ucred.h&gt
     #include &ltsys/mount.h&gt

     int
     getmntinfo(struct statfs **mntbufp, int flags);

TRANSITIIONAL SYNOPSIS (NOW DEPRECATED)
     int
     getmntinfo64(struct statfs64 **mntbufp, int flags);

DESCRIPTION
     The getmntinfo() function returns an array of statfs structures describ-
     ing each currently mounted file system (see statfs(2)).  As statfs(2)
     indicates, the structure is defined differently depending on whether the
     macro _DARWIN_FEATURE_64_BIT_INODE is defined (see stat(2) for more
     information on this macro).

     The getmntinfo() function passes its flags argument transparently to
     getfsstat(2).

RETURN VALUES
     On successful completion, getmntinfo() returns a count of the number of
     elements in the array.  The pointer to the array is stored into mntbufp.

     If an error occurs, zero is returned and the external variable errno is
     set to indicate the error.  Although the pointer mntbufp will be unmodi-
     fied, any information previously returned by getmntinfo() will be lost.

ERRORS
     The getmntinfo() function may fail and set errno for any of the errors
     specified for the library routines getfsstat(2) or malloc(3).

TRANSITIONAL DESCRIPTION (NOW DEPRECATED)
     The getmntinfo64() routine is equivalent to its corresponding non-64-suf-
     fixed routine, when 64-bit inodes are in effect.  It was added before
     there was support for the symbol variants, and so is now deprecated.
     Instead of using it, set the _DARWIN_USE_64_BIT_INODE macro before
     including header files to force 64-bit inode support.

     The statfs64 structure used by this deprecated routine is the same as the
     statfs structure when 64-bit inodes are in effect.

SEE ALSO
     getfsstat(2), mount(2), stat(2), statfs(2), mount(8)

HISTORY
     The getmntinfo() function first appeared in 4.4BSD.

BUGS
     The getmntinfo() function writes the array of structures to an internal
     static object and returns a pointer to that object.  Subsequent calls to
     getmntinfo() will modify the same object.

     The memory allocated by getmntinfo() cannot be free(3)'d by the applica-
     tion.
