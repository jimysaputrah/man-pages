NAME
       Tcl_BackgroundError - report Tcl error that occurred in background pro-
       cessing

SYNOPSIS
       #include <tcl.h>

       Tcl_BackgroundError(interp)

ARGUMENTS
       Tcl_Interp *interp (in)		Interpreter   in   which   the	 error
					occurred.

DESCRIPTION
       This  procedure	is  typically  invoked	when a Tcl error occurs during
       "background processing" such as executing an event handler.  When  such
       an  error occurs, the error condition is reported to Tcl or to a widget
       or some other C code, and there is not usually any obvious way for that
       code  to  report  the error to the user.  In these cases the code calls
       Tcl_BackgroundError with an interp argument identifying the interpreter
       in  which  the  error  occurred.   At  the  time Tcl_BackgroundError is
       invoked, the interpreter's result is expected to contain an error  mes-
       sage.   Tcl_BackgroundError  will invoke the command registered in that
       interpreter to handle background errors by the interp bgerror  command.
       The  registered	handler  command  is  meant  to report the error in an
       application-specific fashion.  The handler command receives  two  argu-
       ments,  the  result of the interp, and the return options of the interp
       at the time the error occurred.	If the application registers  no  han-
       dler  command, the default handler command will attempt to call bgerror
       to report the error.  If an error condition arises while  invoking  the
       handler	command,  then Tcl_BackgroundError reports the error itself by
       printing a message on the standard error file.

       Tcl_BackgroundError does not invoke  the  handler  command  immediately
       because	this  could  potentially  interfere  with  scripts that are in
       process at the time the error occurred.	Instead, it invokes  the  han-
       dler command later as an idle callback.

       It is possible for many background errors to accumulate before the han-
       dler command is invoked.  When this happens, each of the errors is pro-
       cessed in order.  However, if the handle command returns a break excep-
       tion, then all remaining error reports for the interpreter are skipped.
