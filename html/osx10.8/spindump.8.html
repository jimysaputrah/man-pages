NAME
     spindump -- Profile entire system during a time interval

SYNOPSIS
     spindump [pid | partial-name [duration [interval]]] [-file path] [-wait]
	      [-findDsyms] [-delayOnSignal seconds]

DESCRIPTION
     spindump is used by various system components to create reports when an
     unresponsive application is force quit. Reports are stored at:

     /Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/

     For normal application force quits spindump will display a dialog to
     offer the choice to view more details and/or send a report to Apple.

     -------------------------------------

     When run manually, spindump samples user and kernel stacks for every
     process in the system.

     The process with the matching pid or partial-name will be sorted topmost
     in the report, if specified. "-notarget" may be used to avoid providing a
     target process when specifying a duration and interval.

     duration is the duration of the sampling in seconds. If not specified,
     the default of 10 seconds is used.

     interval is the number of miliseconds between samples. If not specified,
     the default of 10 miliseconds is used.

     The -file argument specifies where the report should be written. If path
     is a file, it will be overwritten. If path is a directory, a file will be
     created inside that directory with the name following the format <app-
     name>_<pid>.spindump.txt. If a file by that name already exists, spindump
     will add a unique number to the filename. If not specified, spindump will
     output reports to files inside /tmp.

     The -wait flag tells spindump to wait for the process to exist before
     sampling. If the process already exists, spindump will begin sampling
     immediately.

     The -findDsyms flag tells spindump to use spotlight to find dsyms for use
     during symbolication.

     The -delayOnSignal argument tells spindump to wait seconds seconds after
     receiving a signal before exiting.
