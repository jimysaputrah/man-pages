LDAP_FIRST_ATTRIBUTE(3) 			       LDAP_FIRST_ATTRIBUTE(3)



NAME
       ldap_first_attribute,  ldap_next_attribute  -  step  through LDAP entry
       attributes

LIBRARY
       OpenLDAP LDAP (libldap, -lldap)

SYNOPSIS
       #include &ltldap.h&gt

       char *ldap_first_attribute(
	    LDAP *ld, LDAPMessage *entry, BerElement **berptr )

       char *ldap_next_attribute(
	    LDAP *ld, LDAPMessage *entry, BerElement *ber )

DESCRIPTION
       The ldap_first_attribute() and ldap_next_attribute() routines are  used
       to    step    through	the    attributes    in    an	 LDAP	entry.
       ldap_first_attribute()	 takes	  an	entry	 as    returned     by
       ldap_first_entry(3)  or	ldap_next_entry(3)  and  returns  a pointer to
       character string containing the	first  attribute  description  in  the
       entry.  ldap_next_attribute() returns the next attribute description in
       the entry.

       It also returns, in berptr, a pointer to a BerElement it has  allocated
       to  keep  track of its current position.  This pointer should be passed
       to subsequent calls to ldap_next_attribute() and is used to effectively
       step  through the entry's attributes.  The caller is solely responsible
       for freeing the BerElement pointed to by berptr when it	is  no	longer
       needed  by  calling  ber_free(3).   When  calling  ber_free(3)  in this
       instance, be sure the second argument is 0.

       The attribute names returned are suitable for inclusion in  a  call  to
       ldap_get_values(3) to retrieve the attribute's values.

ERRORS
       If  an  error occurs, NULL is returned and the ld_errno field in the ld
       parameter is set to  indicate  the  error.   See  ldap_error(3)	for  a
       description of possible error codes.

NOTES
       The ldap_first_attribute() and ldap_next_attribute() return dynamically
       allocated memory that must be freed by the caller via  ldap_memfree(3).
