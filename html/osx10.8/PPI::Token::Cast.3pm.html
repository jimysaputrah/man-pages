PPI::Token::Cast(3)   User Contributed Perl Documentation  PPI::Token::Cast(3)



NAME
       PPI::Token::Cast - A prefix which forces a value into a different
       context

INHERITANCE
	 PPI::Token::Cast
	 isa PPI::Token
	     isa PPI::Element

DESCRIPTION
       A "cast" in PPI terms is one of more characters used as a prefix which
       force a value into a different class or context.

       This includes referencing, dereferencing, and a few other minor cases.

       For expressions such as @$foo or "@{ $foo{bar} }" the "@" in both cases
       represents a cast. In this case, an array dereference.

METHODS
       There are no additional methods beyond those provided by the parent
       PPI::Token and PPI::Element classes.
