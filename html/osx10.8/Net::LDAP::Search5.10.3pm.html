NAME
       Net::LDAP::Search - Object returned by Net::LDAP search method

SYNOPSIS
	use Net::LDAP;

	$mesg = $ldap->search( @search_args );

	@entries = $mesg->entries;

DESCRIPTION
       A Net::LDAP::Search object is returned from the search method of a
       Net::LDAP object. It is a container object which holds the results of
       the search.

METHODS
       Net::LDAP::Search inherits from Net::LDAP::Message, and so supports all
       methods defined in Net::LDAP::Message.

       as_struct ( )
	   Returns a reference to a HASH, where the keys are the DNs of the
	   results and the values are HASH references. These second level
	   HASHes hold the attributes such that the keys are the attribute
	   names, in lowercase, and the values are references to an ARRAY
	   holding the values.

	   This method will block until the whole search request has finished.

       count ( )
	   Returns the number of entries returned by the server.

	   This method will block until the whole search request has finished.

       entry ( INDEX )
	   Return the N'th entry, which will be a Net::LDAP::Entry object. If
	   INDEX is greater than the total number of entries returned then
	   "undef" will be returned.

	   This method will block until the search request has returned enough
	   entries.

       entries ( )
	   Return an array of Net::LDAP::Entry objects that were returned from
	   the server.

	   This method will block until the whole search request has finished.

       pop_entry ( )
	   Pop an entry from the internal list of Net::LDAP::Entry objects for
	   this search. If there are no more entries then "undef" is returned.

	   This call will block if the list is empty, until the server returns
	   another entry.

       references ( )
	   Return a list of references that the server returned. This will be
	   a list of Net::LDAP::Reference objects.

       sorted ( )
	   Return a list Net::LDAP::Entry objects, sorted by their DNs.

	   The sorting is done on the client side using Perl's alphanumerical
	   sort operator "cmp".

       sorted ( ATTR, ... )
	   Return a list of Net::LDAP::Entry objects, sorted by the specified
	   attributes. The attributes are compared in the order specified,
	   each only being compared if all the prior attributes compare equal.

	   The sorting is done on the client side using Perl's alphanumerical
	   sort operator "cmp".

       shift_entry ( )
	   Shift an entry from the internal list of Net::LDAP::Entry objects
	   for this search. If there are no more entries then "undef" is
	   returned.

	   This call will block if the list is empty, until the server returns
	   another entry.
