NAME
       Tk_GetGC, Tk_FreeGC - maintain database of read-only graphics contexts

SYNOPSIS
       #include <tk.h>

       GC
       Tk_GetGC(tkwin, valueMask, valuePtr)

       Tk_FreeGC(display, gc)

ARGUMENTS
       Tk_Window tkwin (in)		     Token  for  window  in  which the
					     graphics context will be used.

       unsigned long valueMask (in)	     Mask of  bits  (such  as  GCFore-
					     ground  or  GCStipple) indicating
					     which  fields  of	*valuePtr  are
					     valid.

       XGCValues *valuePtr (in) 	     Pointer  to  structure describing
					     the desired values for the graph-
					     ics context.

       Display *display (in)		     Display  for  which  gc was allo-
					     cated.

       GC gc (in)			     X identifier for graphics context
					     that  is  no longer needed.  Must
					     have been allocated by  Tk_GetGC.

DESCRIPTION
       Tk_GetGC  and  Tk_FreeGC manage a collection of graphics contexts being
       used by an application.	The procedures allow graphics contexts	to  be
       shared,	thereby avoiding the server overhead that would be incurred if
       a separate GC were created for  each  use.   Tk_GetGC  takes  arguments
       describing the desired graphics context and returns an X identifier for
       a GC that fits the description.	The graphics context that is  returned
       will  have default values in all of the fields not specified explicitly
       by valueMask and valuePtr.

       Tk_GetGC maintains a database of all the graphics contexts it has  cre-
       ated.   Whenever  possible,  a call to Tk_GetGC will return an existing
       graphics context rather than creating a new  one.   This  approach  can
       substantially  reduce  server overhead, so Tk_GetGC should generally be
       used in preference to the Xlib procedure XCreateGC, which creates a new
       graphics context on each call.

       Since  the  return  values of Tk_GetGC are shared, callers should never
       modify the graphics contexts returned by Tk_GetGC.  If a graphics  con-
       text must be modified dynamically, then it should be created by calling
       XCreateGC instead of Tk_GetGC.

       When a graphics context is no longer needed, Tk_FreeGC should be called
       to  release it.	There should be exactly one call to Tk_FreeGC for each
       call to Tk_GetGC.  When a graphics context is no longer in use anywhere
       (i.e.  it has been freed as many times as it has been gotten) Tk_FreeGC
       will release it to the X server and delete it from the database.
