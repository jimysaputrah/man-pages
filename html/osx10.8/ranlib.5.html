RANLIB(5)		    BSD File Formats Manual		     RANLIB(5)

NAME
     ranlib -- archive (library) table-of-contents format

SYNOPSIS
     #include &ltmach-o/ranlib.h&gt

DESCRIPTION
     The archive table-of-contents command ranlib creates a table of contents
     for archives, containing object files, to be used by the link-editor
     ld(1).  It operates on archives created with the utility ar(1).

     The Ranlib function prepends a new file to the archive which has three
     separate parts.  The first part is a standard archive header, which has a
     special name field,  "__.SYMDEF" or "__.SYMDEF SORTED".  If the archive
     does not have multiple members that define symbol then "__.SYMDEF SORTED"
     should be used and the table of contents should be sorted by name.

     The second part is a ``long'' followed by a list of ranlib structures.
     The long is the size, in bytes, of the list of ranlib structures.	Each
     of the ranlib structures consists of a zero based offset into the next
     section (a string table of symbols) and an offset from the beginning of
     the archive to the start of the archive file which defines the symbol.
     The actual number of ranlib structures is this number divided by the size
     of an individual ranlib structure.

     The third part is a ``long'' followed by a string table.  The long is the
     size, in bytes of the string table.
