DESCRIPTION
     The editline library provides generic line editing, history and tokeniza-
     tion functions, similar to those found in sh(1).

     These functions are available in the libedit library (which needs the
     libcurses library).  Programs should be linked with -ledit -lcurses.

LINE EDITING FUNCTIONS
     The line editing functions use a common data structure, EditLine, which
     is created by el_init() and freed by el_end().

     The following functions are available:

     el_init()
	   Initialise the line editor, and return a data structure to be used
	   by all other line editing functions.  prog is the name of the
	   invoking program, used when reading the editrc(5) file to determine
	   which settings to use.  fin, fout and ferr are the input, output,
	   and error streams (respectively) to use.  In this documentation,
	   references to ``the tty'' are actually to this input/output stream
	   combination.

     el_end()
	   Clean up and finish with e, assumed to have been created with
	   el_init().

     el_reset()
	   Reset the tty and the parser.  This should be called after an error
	   which may have upset the tty's state.

     el_gets()
	   Read a line from the tty.  count is modified to contain the number
	   of characters read.	Returns the line read if successful, or NULL
	   if no characters were read or if an error occurred.

     el_getc()
	   Read a character from the tty.  ch is modified to contain the char-
	   acter read.	Returns the number of characters read if successful,
	   -1 otherwise.

     el_push()
	   Pushes str back onto the input stream.  This is used by the macro
	   expansion mechanism.  Refer to the description of bind -s in
	   editrc(5) for more information.

     el_parse()
	   Parses the argv array (which is argc elements in size) to execute
	   builtin editline commands.  If the command is prefixed with
	   ``prog'': then el_parse() will only execute the command if ``prog''
	   matches the prog argument supplied to el_init().  The return value
	   is -1 if the command is unknown, 0 if there was no error or
	   ``prog'' didn't match, or 1 if the command returned an error.
	   Refer to editrc(5) for more information.

     el_set()
	   Set editline parameters.  op determines which parameter to set, and
	   each operation has its own parameter list.

	   The following values for op are supported, along with the required
	   argument list:

	   EL_PROMPT, char *(*f)(EditLine *)
		 Define prompt printing function as f, which is to return a
		 string that contains the prompt.

	   EL_REFRESH
		 Re-display the current line on the next terminal line.

	   EL_RPROMPT, char *(*f)(EditLine *)
		 Define right side prompt printing function as f, which is to
		 return a string that contains the prompt.

	   EL_TERMINAL, const char *type
		 Define terminal type of the tty to be type, or to TERM if
		 type is NULL.

	   EL_EDITOR, const char *mode
		 Set editing mode to mode, which must be one of ``emacs'' or
		 ``vi''.

	   EL_SIGNAL, int flag
		 If flag is non-zero, editline will install its own signal
		 handler for the following signals when reading command input:
		 SIGCONT, SIGHUP, SIGINT, SIGQUIT, SIGSTOP, SIGTERM, SIGTSTP,
		 and SIGWINCH.	Otherwise, the current signal handlers will be
		 used.

	   EL_BIND, const char *, ..., NULL
		 Perform the bind builtin command.  Refer to editrc(5) for
		 more information.

	   EL_ECHOTC, const char *, ..., NULL
		 Perform the echotc builtin command.  Refer to editrc(5) for
		 more information.

	   EL_SETTC, const char *, ..., NULL
		 Perform the settc builtin command.  Refer to editrc(5) for
		 more information.

	   EL_SETTY, const char *, ..., NULL
		 Perform the setty builtin command.  Refer to editrc(5) for
		 more information.

	   EL_TELLTC, const char *, ..., NULL
		 Perform the telltc builtin command.  Refer to editrc(5) for
		 more information.

	   EL_ADDFN, const char *name, const char *help, unsigned char
		 (*func)(EditLine *e, int ch)
		 Add a user defined function, func(), referred to as name
		 which is invoked when a key which is bound to name is
		 entered.  help is a description of name.  At invocation time,
		 ch is the key which caused the invocation.  The return value
		 of func() should be one of:

		 CC_NORM       Add a normal character.

		 CC_NEWLINE    End of line was entered.

		 CC_EOF        EOF was entered.

		 CC_ARGHACK    Expecting further command input as arguments,
			       do nothing visually.

		 CC_REFRESH    Refresh display.

		 CC_REFRESH_BEEP
			       Refresh display, and beep.

		 CC_CURSOR     Cursor moved, so update and perform CC_REFRESH.

		 CC_REDISPLAY  Redisplay entire input line.  This is useful if
			       a key binding outputs extra information.

		 CC_ERROR      An error occurred.  Beep, and flush tty.

		 CC_FATAL      Fatal error, reset tty to known state.

	   EL_HIST, History *(*func)(History *, int op, ...), const char *ptr
		 Defines which history function to use, which is usually
		 history().  ptr should be the value returned by
		 history_init().

	   EL_EDITMODE, int flag
		 If flag is non-zero, editing is enabled (the default).  Note
		 that this is only an indication, and does not affect the
		 operation of editline.  At this time, it is the caller's
		 responsibility to check this (using el_get()) to determine if
		 editing should be enabled or not.

	   EL_GETCFN, int (*f)(EditLine *, char *c)
		 Define the character reading function as f, which is to
		 return the number of characters read and store them in c.
		 This function is called internally by el_gets() and
		 el_getc().  The builtin function can be set or restored with
		 the special function name ``EL_BUILTIN_GETCFN''.

	   EL_CLIENTDATA, void *data
		 Register data to be associated with this EditLine structure.
		 It can be retrieved with the corresponding el_get() call.

	   EL_SETFP, int fd, FILE *fp
		 Set the current editline file pointer for ``input'' fd = 0,
		 ``output'' fd = 1, or ``error'' fd = 2 from fp.

     el_get()
	   Get editline parameters.  op determines which parameter to retrieve
	   into result.  Returns 0 if successful, -1 otherwise.

	   The following values for op are supported, along with actual type
	   of result:

	   EL_PROMPT, char *(*f)(EditLine *)
		 Return a pointer to the function that displays the prompt.

	   EL_RPROMPT, char *(*f)(EditLine *)
		 Return a pointer to the function that displays the rightside
		 prompt.

	   EL_EDITOR, const char *
		 Return the name of the editor, which will be one of ``emacs''
		 or ``vi''.

	   EL_GETTC, const char *name, void *value
		 Return non-zero if name is a valid termcap(5) capability and
		 set value to the current value of that capability.

	   EL_SIGNAL, int *
		 Return non-zero if editline has installed private signal han-
		 dlers (see el_get() above).

	   EL_EDITMODE, int *
		 Return non-zero if editing is enabled.

	   EL_GETCFN, int (**f)(EditLine *, char *)
		 Return a pointer to the function that read characters, which
		 is equal to ``EL_BUILTIN_GETCFN'' in the case of the default
		 builtin function.

	   EL_CLIENTDATA, void **data
		 Retrieve data previously registered with the corresponding
		 el_set() call.

	   EL_UNBUFFERED, int
		 Sets or clears unbuffered mode.  In this mode, el_gets() will
		 return immediately after processing a single character.

	   EL_PREP_TERM, int
		 Sets or clears terminal editing mode.

	   EL_GETFP, int fd, FILE **fp
		 Return in fp the current editline file pointer for ``input''
		 fd = 0, ``output'' fd = 1, or ``error'' fd = 2.

     el_source()
	   Initialise editline by reading the contents of file.  el_parse() is
	   called for each line in file.  If file is NULL, try $PWD/.editrc
	   then $HOME/.editrc.	Refer to editrc(5) for details on the format
	   of file.

     el_resize()
	   Must be called if the terminal size changes.  If EL_SIGNAL has been
	   set with el_set(), then this is done automatically.	Otherwise,
	   it's the responsibility of the application to call el_resize() on
	   the appropriate occasions.

     el_line()
	   Return the editing information for the current line in a LineInfo
	   structure, which is defined as follows:

	   typedef struct lineinfo {
	       const char *buffer;    /* address of buffer */
	       const char *cursor;    /* address of cursor */
	       const char *lastchar;  /* address of last character */
	   } LineInfo;

	   buffer is not NUL terminated.  This function may be called after
	   el_gets() to obtain the LineInfo structure pertaining to line
	   returned by that function, and from within user defined functions
	   added with EL_ADDFN.

     el_insertstr()
	   Insert str into the line at the cursor.  Returns -1 if str is empty
	   or won't fit, and 0 otherwise.

     el_deletestr()
	   Delete count characters before the cursor.

HISTORY LIST FUNCTIONS
     The history functions use a common data structure, History, which is cre-
     ated by history_init() and freed by history_end().

     The following functions are available:

     history_init()
	   Initialise the history list, and return a data structure to be used
	   by all other history list functions.

     history_end()
	   Clean up and finish with h, assumed to have been created with
	   history_init().

     history()
	   Perform operation op on the history list, with optional arguments
	   as needed by the operation.	ev is changed accordingly to opera-
	   tion.  The following values for op are supported, along with the
	   required argument list:

	   H_SETSIZE, int size
		 Set size of history to size elements.

	   H_GETSIZE
		 Get number of events currently in history.

	   H_END
		 Cleans up and finishes with h, assumed to be created with
		 history_init().

	   H_CLEAR
		 Clear the history.

	   H_FUNC, void *ptr, history_gfun_t first, history_gfun_t next,
		 history_gfun_t last, history_gfun_t prev, history_gfun_t
		 curr, history_sfun_t set, history_vfun_t clear,
		 history_efun_t enter, history_efun_t add
		 Define functions to perform various history operations.  ptr
		 is the argument given to a function when it's invoked.

	   H_FIRST
		 Return the first element in the history.

	   H_LAST
		 Return the last element in the history.

	   H_PREV
		 Return the previous element in the history.

	   H_NEXT
		 Return the next element in the history.

	   H_CURR
		 Return the current element in the history.

	   H_SET
		 Set the cursor to point to the requested element.

	   H_ADD, const char *str
		 Append str to the current element of the history, or perform
		 the H_ENTER operation with argument str if there is no cur-
		 rent element.

	   H_APPEND, const char *str
		 Append str to the last new element of the history.

	   H_ENTER, const char *str
		 Add str as a new element to the history, and, if necessary,
		 removing the oldest entry to keep the list to the created
		 size.	If H_SETUNIQUE was has been called with a non-zero
		 arguments, the element will not be entered into the history
		 if its contents match the ones of the current history ele-
		 ment.	If the element is entered history() returns 1, if it
		 is ignored as a duplicate returns 0.  Finally history()
		 returns -1 if an error occurred.

	   H_PREV_STR, const char *str
		 Return the closest previous event that starts with str.

	   H_NEXT_STR, const char *str
		 Return the closest next event that starts with str.

	   H_PREV_EVENT, int e
		 Return the previous event numbered e.

	   H_NEXT_EVENT, int e
		 Return the next event numbered e.

	   H_LOAD, const char *file
		 Load the history list stored in file.

	   H_SAVE, const char *file
		 Save the history list to file.

	   H_SETUNIQUE, int unique
		 Set flag that adjacent identical event strings should not be
		 entered into the history.

	   H_GETUNIQUE
		 Retrieve the current setting if adjacent identical elements
		 should be entered into the history.

	   H_DEL, int e
		 Delete the event numbered e.  This function is only provided
		 for readline(3) compatibility.  The caller is responsible for
		 free'ing the string in the returned HistEvent.

	   history() returns &gt= 0 if the operation op succeeds.  Otherwise, -1
	   is returned and ev is updated to contain more details about the
	   error.

TOKENIZATION FUNCTIONS
     The tokenization functions use a common data structure, Tokenizer, which
     is created by tok_init() and freed by tok_end().

     The following functions are available:

     tok_init()
	   Initialise the tokenizer, and return a data structure to be used by
	   all other tokenizer functions.  IFS contains the Input Field Sepa-
	   rators, which defaults to &ltspace&gt , &lttab&gt , and &ltnewline&gt if NULL.

     tok_end()
	   Clean up and finish with t, assumed to have been created with
	   tok_init().

     tok_reset()
	   Reset the tokenizer state.  Use after a line has been successfully
	   tokenized by tok_line() or tok_str() and before a new line is to be
	   tokenized.

     tok_line()
	   Tokenize li, If successful, modify: argv to contain the words, argc
	   to contain the number of words, cursorc (if not NULL) to contain
	   the index of the word containing the cursor, and cursoro (if not
	   NULL) to contain the offset within argv[cursorc] of the cursor.

	   Returns 0 if successful, -1 for an internal error, 1 for an
	   unmatched single quote, 2 for an unmatched double quote, and 3 for
	   a backslash quoted &ltnewline&gt.  A positive exit code indicates that
	   another line should be read and tokenization attempted again.

     tok_str()
	   A simpler form of tok_line(); str is a NUL terminated string to
	   tokenize.

HISTORY
     The editline library first appeared in 4.4BSD.  CC_REDISPLAY appeared in
     NetBSD 1.3.  CC_REFRESH_BEEP, EL_EDITMODE and the readline emulation
     appeared in NetBSD 1.4.  EL_RPROMPT appeared in NetBSD 1.5.

AUTHORS
     The editline library was written by Christos Zoulas.  Luke Mewburn wrote
     this manual and implemented CC_REDISPLAY, CC_REFRESH_BEEP, EL_EDITMODE,
     and EL_RPROMPT.  Jaromir Dolecek implemented the readline emulation.

BUGS
     At this time, it is the responsibility of the caller to check the result
     of the EL_EDITMODE operation of el_get() (after an el_source() or
     el_parse()) to determine if editline should be used for further input.
     I.e., EL_EDITMODE is purely an indication of the result of the most
     recent editrc(5) edit command.
