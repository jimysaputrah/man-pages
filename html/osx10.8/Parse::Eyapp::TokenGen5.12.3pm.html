NAME
       Parse::Eyapp::TokenGen - Support for Using Parse::Eyapp as a Data
       Generator

INTRODUCTION
       For a introduction to data generation using Parse::Eyapp see
       Parse::Eyapp::datagenerationtut.

METHODS
   set_tokengens
       Receives the parser object and the pairs

	   token =&gt generator

       Sets the generator attribute of the tokens.  Though not strictly
       necessary, the generator is a Test::LectroTest::Generator object.

   set_weights
       Receives the parser object and the pairs

	   token =&gt weight

       Sets the weight attribute of the tokens.  The weight is a floating
       number.

   set_tokenweightsandgenerators
       Receives the parser object and the pairs

	   token =&gt [weight, generator]

       or

	   token =&gt weight

       and sets the weight and generator attributes of the tokens.  An example
       can be found in "examples/generator/GenSupport.pm":

	 $parser-&gtset_tokenweightsandgenerators(
	   NUM =&gt [ 2, Int(range=&gt[0, 9], sized=&gt0)],
	   VAR =&gt [
		     0,  # At the beginning, no variables are defined
		     Gen {
		       return  Elements(keys %st)-&gtgenerate if keys %st;
		       return Int(range=&gt[0, 9], sized=&gt0)-&gtgenerate;
		     },
		   ],
	   VARDEF =&gt [
		       2,
		       String( length=&gt[1,2], charset=&gt"A-NP-Z", size =&gt 100 )
		     ],
	   '=' =&gt 2, '-' =&gt 1, '+' =&gt 2,
	   '*' =&gt 4, '/' =&gt 2, '^' =&gt 0.5,
	   ';' =&gt 1, '(' =&gt 1, ')' =&gt 2,
	   ''  =&gt 2, 'error' =&gt 0,
	 );

   token_weight
       Receives the parser object and the token and returns the weight.  If an
       additional weight is provided the weight for the token is set.

   token_generator
       Receives the parser object and the token and returns the generator.  If
       an additional generator is provided the generator for the token is set.

   deltaweight
       Has the syntax:

	 $parser-&gtdeltaweight(TOKEN1 =&gt deltaweight1, TOKEN2 =&gt deltaweight2, ...)

       increases the weight of the respective token by the associated amount.

   pushdeltaweight
       As "deltaweight" but the current weights of the involved tokens are
       saved in a stack

   popweight
       Restores the weights of the tokens that were previously saved with
       "pushdeltaweight"

       I wish to thank Francois Desarmenien for his Parse::Yapp module, to my
       students at La Laguna and to the Perl Community. Thanks to the people
       who have contributed to improve the module (see "CONTRIBUTORS" in
       Parse::Eyapp).  Thanks to Larry Wall for giving us Perl.  Special
       thanks to Juana.
