NAME
       PPI::Find - Object version of the Element-&gtfind method

SYNOPSIS
	 # Create the Find object
	 my $Find = PPI::Find-&gtnew( \&wanted );

	 # Return all matching Elements as a list
	 my @found = $Find-&gtin( $Document );

	 # Can we find any matching Elements
	 if ( $Find-&gtany_matches($Document) ) {
	       print "Found at least one matching Element";
	 }

	 # Use the object as an iterator
	 $Find-&gtstart($Document) or die "Failed to execute search";
	 while ( my $token = $Find-&gtmatch ) {
	       ...
	 }

DESCRIPTION
       PPI::Find is the primary PDOM searching class in the core PPI package.

   History
       It became quite obvious during the development of PPI that many of the
       modules that would be built on top of it were going to need large
       numbers of saved, storable or easily creatable search objects that
       could be reused a number of times.

       Although the internal -&gtfind method provides a basic ability to search,
       it is by no means thorough. PPI::Find attempts to resolve this problem.

   Structure and Style
       PPI::Find provides a similar API to the popular File::Find::Rule module
       for file searching, but without the ability to assemble queries.

       The implementation of a separate PPI::Find::Rule sub-class that does
       provide this ability is left as an exercise for the reader.

   The &wanted function
       At the core of each PPI::Find object is a "wanted" function that is
       passed a number of arguments and returns a value which controls the
       flow of the search.

       As the search executes, each Element will be passed to the wanted
       function in depth-first order.

       It will be provided with two arguments. The current Element to test as
       $_[0], and the top-level Element of the search as $_[1].

       The &wanted function is expected to return 1 (positive) if the Element
       matches the condition, 0 (false) if it does not, and undef (undefined)
       if the condition does not match, and the Find search should not descend
       to any of the current Element's children.

       Errors should be reported from the &wanted function via die, which will
       be caught by the Find object and returned as an error.

METHODS
   new &wanted
       The "new" constructor takes a single argument of the &wanted function,
       as described above and creates a new search.

       Returns a new PPI::Find object, or "undef" if not passed a CODE
       reference.

   clone
       The "clone" method creates another instance of the same Find object.

       The cloning is done safely, so if your existing Find object is in the
       middle of an iteration, the cloned Find object will not also be in the
       iteration and can be safely used independently.

       Returns a duplicate PPI::Find object.

   in $Document [, array_ref =&gt 1 ]
       The "in" method starts and completes a full run of the search.

       It takes as argument a single PPI::Element object which will serve as
       the top of the search process.

       Returns a list of PPI::Element objects that match the condition
       described by the &wanted function, or the null list on error.

       You should check the -&gterrstr method for any errors if you are returned
       the null list, which may also mean simply that no Elements were found
       that matched the condition.

       Because of this need to explicitly check for errors, an alternative
       return value mechanism is provide. If you pass the "array_ref =" 1&gt
       parameter to the method, it will return the list of matched Elements as
       a reference to an ARRAY. The method will return false if no elements
       were matched, or "undef" on error.

       The -&gterrstr method can still be used to get the error message as
       normal.

   start $Element
       The "start" method lets the Find object act as an iterator. The method
       is passed the parent PPI::Element object as for the "in" method, but
       does not accept any parameters.

       To simplify error handling, the entire search is done at once, with the
       results cached and provided as-requested.

       Returns true if the search completes, and false on error.

   match
       The "match" method returns the next matching Element in the iteration.

       Returns a PPI::Element object, or "undef" if there are no remaining
       Elements to be returned.

   finish
       The "finish" method provides a mechanism to end iteration if you wish
       to stop the iteration prematurely. It resets the Find object and allows
       it to be safely reused.

       A Find object will be automatically finished when "match" returns
       false.  This means you should only need to call "finnish" when you stop
       iterating early.

       You may safely call this method even when not iterating and it will
       return without failure.

       Always returns true

   errstr
       The "errstr" method returns the error messages when a given PPI::Find
       object fails any action.

       Returns a string, or "undef" if there is no error.
