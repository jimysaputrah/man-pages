NAME
       Net::Server::HTTP - very basic Net::Server based HTTP server class

TEST ONE LINER
	   perl -e 'use Net::Server::HTTP; Net::Server::HTTP-&gtrun(port=&gt8080)'

SYNOPSIS
	   use base qw(Net::Server::HTTP);
	   __PACKAGE__-&gtrun;

	   sub process_http_request {
	       my $self = shift;

	       print "Content-type: text/html\n\n";
	       print "&ltform method=post action=/bam&gt&ltinput type=text name=foo&gt&ltinput type=submit&gt&lt/form&gt\n";

	       if (require Data::Dumper) {
		   local $Data::Dumper::Sortkeys = 1;
		   my $form = {};
		   if (require CGI) {  my $q = CGI-&gtnew; $form-&gt{$_} = $q-&gtparam($_) for $q-&gtparam;  }
		   print "&ltpre&gt".Data::Dumper-&gtDump([\%ENV, $form], ['*ENV', 'form'])."&lt/pre&gt";
	       }
	   }

DESCRIPTION
       Even though Net::Server::HTTP doesn't fall into the normal parallel of
       the other Net::Server flavors, handling HTTP requests is an often
       requested feature and is a standard and simple protocol.

       Net::Server::HTTP begins with base type MultiType defaulting to
       Net::Server::Fork.  It is easy to change it to any of the other
       Net::Server flavors by passing server_type =&gt $other_flavor in the
       server configurtation.  The port has also been defaulted to port 80 -
       but could easily be changed to another through the server
       configuration.

METHODS
       "process_http_request"
	   During this method, the %ENV will have been set to a standard CGI
	   style environment.  You will need to be sure to print the Content-
	   type header.  This is one change from the other standard
	   Net::Server base classes.

	   During this method you can read from ENV and STDIN just like a
	   normal HTTP request in other web servers.  You can print to STDOUT
	   and Net::Server will handle the header negotiation for you.

	   Note: Net::Server::HTTP has no concept of document root or script
	   aliases or default handling of static content.  That is up to the
	   consumer of Net::Server::HTTP to work out.

	   Net::Server::HTTP comes with a basic ENV display installed as the
	   default process_request method.

       "process_request"
	   This method has been overridden in Net::Server::HTTP - you should
	   not use it while using Net::Server::HTTP.  This method parses the
	   environment and sets up request alarms and handles dying failures.
	   It calls process_http_request once the request is ready.

       "send_status"
	   Takes an HTTP status and a message.	Sends out the correct headers.

       "send_501"
	   Calls send_status with 501 and the argument passed to send_501.

COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS
       In addition to the command line arguments of the Net::Server base
       classes you can also set the following options.

       max_header_size
	   Defaults to 100_000.  Maximum number of bytes to read while parsing
	   headers.

       server_revision
	   Defaults to Net::Server::HTTP/$Net::Server::VERSION.

       timeout_header
	   Defaults to 15 - number of seconds to wait for parsing headers.

       timeout_idle
	   Defaults to 60 - number of seconds a request can be idle before the
	   request is closed.

TODO
       Add support for writing out HTTP/1.1.
