NAME
       form_field_opts - set and get field options

SYNOPSIS
       #include &ltform.h&gt
       int set_field_opts(FIELD *field, Field_Options opts);
       int field_opts_on(FIELD *field, Field_Options opts);
       int field_opts_off(FIELD *field, Field_Options opts);
       Field_Options field_opts(const FIELD *field);

DESCRIPTION
       The  function  set_field_opts  sets  all  the given field's option bits
       (field option bits may be logically-OR'ed together).

       The function field_opts_on turns on the given option bits,  and	leaves
       others alone.

       The function field_opts_off turns off the given option bits, and leaves
       others alone.

       The function field_opts returns the field's current option bits.

       The following options are defined (all are on by default):

       O_VISIBLE
	    The field is displayed.  If this option is	off,  display  of  the
	    field is suppressed.

       O_ACTIVE
	    The  field	is  visited during processing.	If this option is off,
	    the field will not be reachable by navigation keys. Please	notice
	    that an invisible field appears to be inactive also.

       O_PUBLIC
	    The field contents are displayed as data is entered.

       O_EDIT
	    The field can be edited.

       O_WRAP
	    Words  that  do  not  fit  on a line are wrapped to the next line.
	    Words are blank-separated.

       O_BLANK
	    The field is cleared whenever a character is entered at the  first
	    position.

       O_AUTOSKIP
	    Skip to the next field when this one fills.

       O_NULLOK
	    Allow a blank field.

       O_STATIC
	    Field  buffers  are  fixed	to  field's  original size.  Turn this
	    option off to create a dynamic field.

       O_PASSOK
	    Validate field only if modified by user.

RETURN VALUE
       Except for field_opts, each routine returns one of the following:

       E_OK The routine succeeded.

       E_BAD_ARGUMENT
	    Routine detected an incorrect or out-of-range argument.

       E_CURRENT
	    The field is the current field.

       E_SYSTEM_ERROR
	    System error occurred (see errno).

SEE ALSO
       curses(3X), form(3X).



	      NOTES  The  header  file	&ltform.h&gt  automatically  includes  the
	      header file &ltcurses.h&gt.

PORTABILITY
       These  routines emulate the System V forms library.  They were not sup-
       ported on Version 7 or BSD versions.
