NAME
       git-shortlog - Summarize 'git log' output

SYNOPSIS
       git log --pretty=short | git shortlog [-h] [-n] [-s] [-e] [-w]
       git shortlog [-n|--numbered] [-s|--summary] [-e|--email] [-w[<width>[,<indent1>[,<indent2>]]]] <commit>...


DESCRIPTION
       Summarizes git log output in a format suitable for inclusion in release
       announcements. Each commit will be grouped by author and the first line
       of the commit message will be shown.

       Additionally, "[PATCH]" will be stripped from the commit description.

       If no revisions are passed on the command line and either standard
       input is not a terminal or there is no current branch, git shortlog
       will output a summary of the log read from standard input, without
       reference to the current repository.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
	   Print a short usage message and exit.

       -n, --numbered
	   Sort output according to the number of commits per author instead
	   of author alphabetic order.

       -s, --summary
	   Suppress commit description and provide a commit count summary
	   only.

       -e, --email
	   Show the email address of each author.

       --format[=<format>]
	   Instead of the commit subject, use some other information to
	   describe each commit.  <format> can be any string accepted by the
	   --format option of git log, such as * [%h] %s. (See the "PRETTY
	   FORMATS" section of git-log(1).)

	       Each pretty-printed commit will be rewrapped before it is shown.

       -w[<width>[,<indent1>[,<indent2>]]]
	   Linewrap the output by wrapping each line at width. The first line
	   of each entry is indented by indent1 spaces, and the second and
	   subsequent lines are indented by indent2 spaces.  width, indent1,
	   and indent2 default to 76, 6 and 9 respectively.

MAPPING AUTHORS
       The .mailmap feature is used to coalesce together commits by the same
       person in the shortlog, where their name and/or email address was
       spelled differently.

       If the file .mailmap exists at the toplevel of the repository, or at
       the location pointed to by the mailmap.file configuration option, it is
       used to map author and committer names and email addresses to canonical
       real names and email addresses.

       In the simple form, each line in the file consists of the canonical
       real name of an author, whitespace, and an email address used in the
       commit (enclosed by < and >) to map to the name. For example:

	   Proper Name <commit@email.xx>

       The more complex forms are:

	   <proper@email.xx> <commit@email.xx>

       which allows mailmap to replace only the email part of a commit, and:

	   Proper Name <proper@email.xx> <commit@email.xx>

       which allows mailmap to replace both the name and the email of a commit
       matching the specified commit email address, and:

	   Proper Name <proper@email.xx> Commit Name <commit@email.xx>

       which allows mailmap to replace both the name and the email of a commit
       matching both the specified commit name and email address.

       Example 1: Your history contains commits by two authors, Jane and Joe,
       whose names appear in the repository under several forms:

	   Joe Developer <joe@example.com>
	   Joe R. Developer <joe@example.com>
	   Jane Doe <jane@example.com>
	   Jane Doe <jane@laptop.(none)>
	   Jane D. <jane@desktop.(none)>


       Now suppose that Joe wants his middle name initial used, and Jane
       prefers her family name fully spelled out. A proper .mailmap file would
       look like:

	   Jane Doe	    <jane@desktop.(none)>
	   Joe R. Developer <joe@example.com>


       Note how there is no need for an entry for <jane@laptop[1].(none)>,
       because the real name of that author is already correct.

       Example 2: Your repository contains commits from the following authors:

	   nick1 <bugs@company.xx>
	   nick2 <bugs@company.xx>
	   nick2 <nick2@company.xx>
	   santa <me@company.xx>
	   claus <me@company.xx>
	   CTO <cto@coompany.xx>


       Then you might want a .mailmap file that looks like:

	   <cto@company.xx>			  <cto@coompany.xx>
	   Some Dude <some@dude.xx>	    nick1 <bugs@company.xx>
	   Other Author <other@author.xx>   nick2 <bugs@company.xx>
	   Other Author <other@author.xx>	  <nick2@company.xx>
	   Santa Claus <santa.claus@northpole.xx> <me@company.xx>


       Use hash # for comments that are either on their own line, or after the
       email address.
