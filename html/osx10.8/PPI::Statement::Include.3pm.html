NAME
       PPI::Statement::Include - Statements that include other code

SYNOPSIS
	 # The following are all includes
	 use 5.006;
	 use strict;
	 use My::Module;
	 use constant FOO =&gt 'Foo';
	 require Foo::Bar;
	 require "Foo/Bar.pm";
	 require $foo if 1;
	 no strict 'refs';

INHERITANCE
	 PPI::Statement::Include
	 isa PPI::Statement
	     isa PPI::Node
		 isa PPI::Element

DESCRIPTION
       Despite its name, the "PPI::Statement::Include" class covers a number
       of different types of statement that cover all statements starting with
       "use", "no" and "require".

       But basically, they cover three situations.

       Firstly, a dependency on a particular version of perl (for which the
       "version" method returns true), a pragma (for which the "pragma" method
       returns true, or the loading (and unloading via no) of modules.

METHODS
       "PPI::Statement::Include" has a number of methods in addition to the
       standard PPI::Statement, PPI::Node and PPI::Element methods.

   type
       The "type" method returns the general type of statement ('use', 'no' or
       'require').

       Returns the type as a string, or "undef" if the type cannot be
       detected.

   module
       The "module" method returns the module name specified in any include
       statement. This "includes" pragma names, because pragma are implemented
       as modules. (And lets face it, the definition of a pragma can be fuzzy
       at the best of times in any case)

       This covers all of these...

	 use strict;
	 use My::Module;
	 no strict;
	 require My::Module;

       ...but does not cover any of these...

	 use 5.006;
	 require 5.005;
	 require "explicit/file/name.pl";

       Returns the module name as a string, or "undef" if the include does not
       specify a module name.

   module_version
       The "module_version" method returns the minimum version of the module
       required by the statement, if there is one.

   pragma
       The "pragma" method checks for an include statement's use as a pragma,
       and returns it if so.

       Or at least, it claims to. In practice it's a lot harder to say exactly
       what is or isn't a pragma, because the definition is fuzzy.

       The "intent" of a pragma is to modify the way in which the parser
       works.  This is done though the use of modules that do various types of
       internals magic.

       For now, PPI assumes that any "module name" that is only a set of
       lowercase letters (and perhaps numbers, like "use utf8;"). This
       behaviour is expected to change, most likely to something that knows
       the specific names of the various "pragmas".

       Returns the name of the pragma, or false ('') if the include is not a
       pragma.

   version
       The "version" method checks for an include statement that introduces a
       dependency on the version of "perl" the code is compatible with.

       This covers two specific statements.

	 use 5.006;
	 require 5.006;

       Currently the version is returned as a string, although in future the
       version may be returned as a version object.  If you want a numeric
       representation, use "version_literal()".  Returns false if the
       statement is not a version dependency.

   version_literal
       The "version_literal" method has the same behavior as "version()", but
       the version is returned as a numeric literal.  Returns false if the
       statement is not a version dependency.

       The "arguments" method gives you the rest of the statement after the
       the module/pragma and module version, i.e. the stuff that will be used
       to construct what gets passed to the module's "import()" subroutine.
       This does include the comma, etc. operators, but doesn't include non-
       significant direct children or any final semicolon.
