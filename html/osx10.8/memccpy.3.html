MEMCCPY(3)		 BSD Library Functions Manual		    MEMCCPY(3)

NAME
     memccpy -- copy string until character found

LIBRARY
     Standard C Library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
     #include &ltstring.h&gt

     void *
     memccpy(void *restrict s1, const void *restrict s2, int c, size_t n);

DESCRIPTION
     The memccpy() function copies bytes from string s2 to string s1.  If the
     character c (as converted to an unsigned char) occurs in the string s2,
     the copy stops and a pointer to the byte after the copy of c in the
     string s1 is returned.  Otherwise, n bytes are copied, and a NULL pointer
     is returned.

     The source and destination strings should not overlap, as the behavior is
     undefined.

SEE ALSO
     bcopy(3), memcpy(3), memmove(3), strcpy(3)

HISTORY
     The memccpy() function first appeared in 4.4BSD.
