NAME
       XML::LibXML::SAX - XML::LibXML direct SAX parser

DESCRIPTION
       XML::LibXML provides an interface to libxml2 direct SAX interface.
       Through this interface it is possible to generate SAX events directly
       while parsing a document. While using the SAX parser XML::LibXML will
       not create a DOM Document tree.

       Such an interface is useful if very large XML documents have to be
       processed and no DOM functions are required. By using this interface it
       is possible to read data stored within a XML document directly into the
       application data structures without loading the document into memory.

       The SAX interface of XML::LibXML is based on the famous XML::SAX
       interface. It uses the generic interface as provided by XML::SAX::Base.

       Additionally to the generic functions, which are only able to process
       entire documents, XML::LibXML::SAX provides parse_chunk(). This method
       generates SAX events from well balanced data such as is often provided
       by databases.

       NOTE: At the moment XML::LibXML provides only an incomplete interface
       to libxml2's native SAX implementation. The current implementation is
       not tested in production environment. It may causes significant memory
       problems or shows wrong behaviour. If you run into specific problems
       using this part of XML::LibXML, let me know.
