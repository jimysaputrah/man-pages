NAME
       IO::Poll - Object interface to system poll call

SYNOPSIS
	   use IO::Poll qw(POLLRDNORM POLLWRNORM POLLIN POLLHUP);

	   $poll = new IO::Poll;

	   $poll-&gtmask($input_handle =&gt POLLIN);
	   $poll-&gtmask($output_handle =&gt POLLOUT);

	   $poll-&gtpoll($timeout);

	   $ev = $poll-&gtevents($input);

DESCRIPTION
       "IO::Poll" is a simple interface to the system level poll routine.

METHODS
       mask ( IO [, EVENT_MASK ] )
	   If EVENT_MASK is given, then, if EVENT_MASK is non-zero, IO is
	   added to the list of file descriptors and the next call to poll
	   will check for any event specified in EVENT_MASK. If EVENT_MASK is
	   zero then IO will be removed from the list of file descriptors.

	   If EVENT_MASK is not given then the return value will be the
	   current event mask value for IO.

       poll ( [ TIMEOUT ] )
	   Call the system level poll routine. If TIMEOUT is not specified
	   then the call will block. Returns the number of handles which had
	   events happen, or -1 on error.

       events ( IO )
	   Returns the event mask which represents the events that happened on
	   IO during the last call to "poll".

       remove ( IO )
	   Remove IO from the list of file descriptors for the next poll.

       handles( [ EVENT_MASK ] )
	   Returns a list of handles. If EVENT_MASK is not given then a list
	   of all handles known will be returned. If EVENT_MASK is given then
	   a list of handles will be returned which had one of the events
	   specified by EVENT_MASK happen during the last call ti "poll"
