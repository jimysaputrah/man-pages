NAME
       Locale::Maketext::Lexicon::Auto - Auto fallback lexicon for Maketext

SYNOPSIS
	   package Hello::I18N;
	   use base 'Locale::Maketext';
	   use Locale::Maketext::Lexicon {
	       en =&gt ['Auto'],
	       # ... other languages
	   };

DESCRIPTION
       This module builds a simple Lexicon hash that contains nothing but "(
       '_AUTO' =&gt 1)", which tells "Locale::Maketext" that no localizing is
       needed -- just use the lookup key as the returned string.

       It is especially useful if you're starting to prototype a program, and
       do not want to deal with the localization files yet.

CAVEATS
       If the key to "-&gtmaketext" begins with a "_", "Locale::Maketext" will
       still throw an exception.  See "CONTROLLING LOOKUP FAILURE" in
       Locale::Maketext for how to prevent it.

       Locale::Maketext, Locale::Maketext::Lexicon
