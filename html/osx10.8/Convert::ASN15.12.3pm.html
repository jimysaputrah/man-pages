DESCRIPTION
       Convert::ASN1 encodes and decodes ASN.1 data structures using BER/DER
       rules.

METHODS
   new ( [OPTIONS] )
       Contructor, creates a new object.

       If given, OPTIONS are the same ones as for "configure ( OPTIONS )"
       below.

   error ()
       Returns the last error.

   configure ( OPTIONS )
       Configure options to control how Convert::ASN1 will perform various
       tasks.  Options are passed as name-value pairs.

       encode
	   Reference to a hash which contains various encode options.

       decode
	   Reference to a hash which contains various decode options.

       encoding
	   One of 'BER' or 'DER'. The default is 'BER'

       Encode options

       real
	   Which encoding to use for real's. One of 'binary', 'nr1', 'nr2',
	   'nr3'

       time
	   This controls how UTCTime and GeneralizedTime elements are encoded.
	   The default is "withzone".

	   utctime
	       The value passed will be encoded without a zone, ie a UTC
	       value.

	   withzone
	       The value will be encoded with a zone. By default it will be
	       encoded using the local time offset. The offset may be set
	       using the "timezone" configure option.

	   raw The value passed should already be in the correct format and
	       will be copied into the PDU as-is.

       timezone
	   By default UTCTime and GeneralizedTime will be encoded using the
	   local time offset from UTC. This will over-ride that. It is an
	   offset from UTC in seconds.	This option can be overriden by
	   passing a reference to a list of two values as the time value. The
	   list should contain the time value and the offset from UTC in
	   seconds.

       bigint
	   If during encoding an value greater than 32 bits is discovered and
	   is not already a big integer object, then the value will first be
	   converted into a big integer object. This option controls the big
	   integer class into which the objects will be blessed. The default
	   is to use Math::BigInt

       Decode options

       time
	   This controls how a UTCTime or a GeneralizedTime element will be
	   decoded. The default is "utctime".

	   utctime
	       The value returned will be a time value as returned by the
	       "time" function.

	   withzone
	       The value returned will be a reference to an array of two
	       values. The first is the same as with "utctime", the second is
	       the timezone offset, in seconds, that was used in the encoding.

	   raw The value returned will be the raw encoding as extracted from
	       the PDU.

       bigint
	   If during decoding any big integers are discovered (integers
	   greater than 32 bits), they will be decoded into big integer
	   objects. This option controls the big integer class into which the
	   objects will be blessed.  The default is to use Math::BigInt.

       null
	   The value to decode ASN.1 NULL types into.  If not set, it defaults
	   to 1.

   prepare ( ASN )
       Compile the given ASN.1 descripton which can be passed as a string or
       as a filehandle. The syntax used is very close to ASN.1, but has a few
       differences. If the ASN decribes only one macro then encode/decode can
       be called on this object. If ASN describes more than one ASN.1 macro
       then "find" must be called. The method returns undef on error.

   prepare_file ( ASNPATH )
       Compile the ASN.1 description to be read from the specified pathname.

   find ( MACRO )
       Find a macro from a prepared ASN.1 description. Returns an object which
       can be used for encode/decode.

   encode ( VARIABLES )
       Encode a PDU. Top-level variable are passed as name-value pairs, or as
       a reference to a hash containing them. Returns the encoded PDU, or
       undef on error.

   decode ( PDU )
       Decode the PDU, returns a reference to a hash containg the values for
       the PDU. Returns undef if there was an error.

   registeroid ( OID, HANDLER )
       Register a handler for all ASN.1 elements that are "DEFINED BY" the
       given OID.

       HANDLER must be a Convert::ASN1 object, e.g. as returned by "find (
       MACRO )".

   registertype ( NAME, OID, HANDLER )
       Register a handler for all ASN.1 elements named "NAME", that are
       "DEFINED BY" the given OID.

       HANDLER must be a Convert::ASN1 object, e.g. as returned by "find (
       MACRO )".

EXPORTS
       As well as providing an object interface for encoding/decoding PDUs
       Convert::ASN1 also provides the following functions.

   IO Functions
       asn_recv ( SOCK, BUFFER, FLAGS )
	   Will read a single element from the socket SOCK into BUFFER.  FLAGS
	   may be MSG_PEEK as exported by "Socket". Returns the address of the
	   sender, or undef if there was an error. Some systems do not support
	   the return of the peer address when the socket is a connected
	   socket, in these cases the empty string will be returned. This is
	   the same behaviour as the "recv" function in perl itself.

	   It is recommended that if the socket is of type SOCK_DGRAM then
	   "recv" be called directly instead of calling "asn_recv".

       asn_read ( FH, BUFFER, OFFSET )
       asn_read ( FH, BUFFER )
	   Will read a single element from the filehandle FH into BUFFER.
	   Returns the number of bytes read if a complete element was read, -1
	   if an incomplete element was read or undef if there was an error.
	   If OFFSET is specified then it is assumed that BUFFER already
	   contains an incomplete element and new data will be appended
	   starting at OFFSET.

	   If FH is a socket the asn_recv is used to read the element, so the
	   same restiction applies if FH is a socket of type SOCK_DGRAM.

       asn_send ( SOCK, BUFFER, FLAGS, TO )
       asn_send ( SOCK, BUFFER, FLAGS )
	   Identical to calling "send", see perlfunc

       asn_write ( FH, BUFFER )
	   Identical to calling "syswrite" with 2 arguments, see perlfunc

       asn_get ( FH )
	   "asn_get" provides buffered IO. Because it needs a buffer FH must
	   be a GLOB or a reference to a GLOB. "asn_get" will use two entries
	   in the hash element of the GLOB to use as its buffer:

	     asn_buffer - input buffer
	     asn_need	- number of bytes needed for the next element, if known

	   Returns an element or undef if there was an error.

       asn_ready ( FH )
	   "asn_ready" works with "asn_get". It will return true if "asn_get"
	   has already read enough data into the buffer to return a complete
	   element.

   Encode/Decode Functions
       asn_tag ( CLASS, VALUE )
	   Given CLASS and a VALUE, calculate an integer which when encoded
	   will become the tag.

       asn_decode_tag ( TAG )
	   Decode the given ASN.1 encoded "TAG".

       asn_encode_tag ( TAG )
	   Encode TAG value for encoding.  We assume that the tag has been
	   correctly generated with "asn_tag ( CLASS, VALUE )".

       asn_decode_length ( LEN )
	   Decode the given ASN.1 decoded "LEN".

       asn_encode_length ( LEN )
	   Encode the given "LEN" to its ASN.1 encoding.

	   the given file handle, or "STDERR" if the handle is not given.

MAPPING ASN.1 TO PERL
       Every element in the ASN.1 definition has a name, in perl a hash is
       used with these names as an index and the element value as the hash
       value.

	 # ASN.1
	 int INTEGER,
	 str OCTET STRING

	 # Perl
	 { int => 5, str => "text" }

       In the case of a SEQUENCE, SET or CHOICE then the value in the
       namespace will be a hash reference which will be the namespce for the
       elements with that element.

	 # ASN.1
	 int INTEGER,
	 seq SEQUENCE {
	   str OCTET STRING,
	   bool BOOLEAN
	 }

	 # Perl
	 { int => 5, seq => { str => "text", bool => 1}}

       If the element is a SEQUENCE OF, or SET OF, then the value in the
       namespace will be an array reference. The elements in the array will be
       of the type expected by the type following the OF. For example with
       "SEQUENCE OF STRING" the array would contain strings. With "SEQUENCE OF
       SEQUENCE { ... }" the array will contain hash references which will be
       used as namespaces

	 # ASN.1
	 int INTEGER,
	 str SEQUENCE OF OCTET STRING

	 # Perl
	 { int => 5, str => [ "text1", "text2"]}

	 # ASN.1
	 int INTEGER,
	 str SEQUENCE OF SEQUENCE {
	   type OCTET STRING,
	   value INTEGER
	 }

	 # Perl
	 { int => 5, str => [
	   { type => "abc", value => 4 },
	   { type => "def", value => -1 },
	 ]}

   Exceptions
       There are some exceptions where Convert::ASN1 does not require an
       element to be named.  These are SEQUENCE {...}, SET {...} and CHOICE.
       In each case if the element is not given a name then the elements
       inside the {...} will share the same namespace as the elements outside
       of the {...}.

TODO
       o   XS implementation.

       o   More documentation.

       o   More tests.
