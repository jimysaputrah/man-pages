SHMAT(2)		    BSD System Calls Manual		      SHMAT(2)

NAME
     shmat, shmdt -- map/unmap shared memory

SYNOPSIS
     #include &ltsys/shm.h&gt

     void *
     shmat(int shmid, const void *shmaddr, int shmflg);

     int
     shmdt(const void *shmaddr);

DESCRIPTION
     shmat() maps the shared memory segment associated with the shared memory
     identifier shmid into the address space of the calling process. The
     address at which the segment is mapped is determined by the shmaddr
     parameter. If it is equal to 0, the system will pick an address itself.
     Otherwise, an attempt is made to map the shared memory segment at the
     address shmaddr specifies. If SHM_RND is set in shmflg, the system will
     round the address down to a multiple of SHMLBA bytes (SHMLBA is defined
     in &ltsys/shm.h&gt ).	A shared memory segment can be mapped read-only by
     specifying the SHM_RDONLY flag in shmflg.	shmdt() unmaps the shared mem-
     ory segment that is currently mapped at shmaddr from the calling process'
     address space.  shmaddr must be a value returned by a prior shmat() call.
     A shared memory segment will remain existant until it is removed by a
     call to shmctl(2) with the IPC_RMID command.

RETURN VALUES
     shmat() returns the address at which the shared memory segment has been
     mapped into the calling process' address space when successful, shmdt()
     returns 0 on successful completion. Otherwise, a value of -1 is returned,
     and the global variable errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
     The shmat() system call will fail if:

     [EACCES]		The calling process has no permission to access this
			shared memory segment.

     [EINVAL]		shmid is not a valid shared memory identifier.
			shmaddr specifies an illegal address.

     [EMFILE]		The number of shared memory segments has reached the
			system-wide limit.

     [ENOMEM]		There is not enough available data space for the call-
			ing process to map the shared memory segment.

     The shmdt() system call will fail if:

     [EINVAL]		shmaddr is not the start address of a mapped shared
			memory segment.

LEGACY SYNOPSIS
     #include &ltsys/types.h&gt
     #include &ltsys/ipc.h&gt
     #include &ltsys/shm.h&gt

     The include files &ltsys/types.h&gt and &ltsys/ipc.h&gt are necessary for both
     functions.
