NAME
       Inline::Wrapper - Convenient module wrapper/loader routines for
       Inline.pm

SYNOPSIS
       sample.pl:

	use Inline::Wrapper;

	my $inline = Inline::Wrapper-&gtnew(
	   language    =&gt 'C',
	   base_dir    =&gt '.',
	);

	my @symbols = $inline-&gtload( 'answer' );

	my @retvals = $inline-&gtrun( 'answer', 'the_answer', 3, 56 );

	print "The answer is: ", $retvals[0], "\n";

	exit(0);

       answer.c:

	int the_answer( int arg1, int arg2 ) {
	    return ( arg1 * arg2 ) &gt&gt 2;
	}

DESCRIPTION
       Inline::Wrapper provides wrapper routines around Inline to make
       embedding functions from another language into a Perl application much
       more convenient.

       Instead of having to include the external code in a Perl source file
       after the __END__ directive, Inline::Wrapper allows you to have
       separate, individually-configurable module repositories to more easily
       manage all of your external application code.

FEATURES
       Inline::Wrapper provides the following features:

       o   Support for all languages supported by Inline.

       o   A single, unified interface for loading and running module
	   functions.

       o   Loading of files containing pure source code, only in their
	   respective languages, so you can isolate maintenance and management
	   of these modules.

       o   Individually-configurable module directories.

       o   Automatic, run-time module reloading upon file modification time
	   detection.

       o   No more namespace pollution.  All module symbols are loaded into
	   their own individual, private namespaces, so they won't collide
	   with your code or each other.

CONSTRUCTOR
   new()
	   my $wrapper = Inline::Wrapper-&gtnew(
		 language	 =&gt 'C',
		 base_dir	 =&gt 'src/code/C',
		 auto_reload	 =&gt 1,
	   );

       Create a new Inline::Wrapper object, with the appropriate attributes
       (if specified).

       ARGUMENTS:

       All arguments are of the hash form  Var =&gt Value.  "new()" will
       complain and croak if they do not follow this form.

       The arguments to "new()" become the defaults used by "load()".  You can
       individually configure loaded modules using "load()", as well.

       language 	  [ default: 'Lua' ]
	   Optional.  Set to the default language for which you wish to load
	   modules, if not explicitly specified via "load()".

	   NOTE: It defaults to Lua because that is what I wrote this module
	   for.  Just pass in the argument if you don't like that.

	   ALSO NOTE: Currently only a couple of "known" languages are hard-
	   coded into this module.  If you wish to use others, don't pass this
	   argument, and use the "add_language()" method after the object has
	   been instantiated.

       auto_reload	  [ default: FALSE ]
	   Optional.  Set to a TRUE value to default to automatically checking
	   if modules have been changed since the last "load()", and reload
	   them if necessary.

       base_dir 	  [ default: '.' ]
	   Optional.  Set to the default base directory from which you wish to
	   load all modules.

       RETURNS: blessed $object, or undef on failure.

METHODS
   initialize()
	   $obj-&gtinitialize();

       Initialize arguments.  If you are subclassing, overload this, not
       "new()".

       Generally only called from within "new()".

   load()
	   my @functions = $obj-&gtload( $modname, %arguments );

       The workhorse.  Loads the actual module referred to by $modname,
       imports its symbols into a private namespace, and makes them available
       to call via "run()".

       ARGUMENTS:

       $modname is REQUIRED.  It corresponds to the base filename, without
       extension, loaded from the base_dir.  See the "Details of steps taken
       by load()" section, Step 3, for clarification of how pathname
       resolution is done.  $modname is also how you will refer to this
       particular module from your program, so keep track of it.

       This method accepts all of the same arguments as "new()".  Thus, you
       can set the defaults via "new()", yet still individually configure
       module components differently from the defaults, if desired.

       Returns a list of @functions made available by loading $modname, or
       warns and returns an empty list if unsuccessful.

       Details of steps taken by load()

       Since this is the real guts of this module, here are the exact steps
       taken when loading the module, doing pathname resolution, etc.

       1. Checks to see if the specified module has already been loaded, and
       if so, returns the list of functions loaded and available in that
       module immediately.
       2. Creates a new Inline::Wrapper::Module container object with any
       supplied %arguments, or the defaults you specified with "new()".
       3. Constructs a path to the specified $modname, roughly as follows:
	       join( $PATH_SEP, $base_dir , $modname . $lang_ext );

	   $base_dir is taken either from the default created with "new()", or
	   the explicitly supplied base_dir argument to "load()".
	   $path_separator is just the appropriate path separator for your OS.
	   $modname is your supplied module name.  Note that this means that
	   you can supply your own subdirectories, as well; i.e. 'foo' is just
	   as valid as 'foo/bar/baz'.
	   $lang_ext is taken from a data structure that defaults to common
	   filename extensions on a per-language basis.  Any of these can be
	   overridden via the "add_language()" method.
       4. Attempts to open the file at the path constructed above, and if
       successful, slurps in the entire source file.
       5. Attempts to bind() (compile and set symbols) it with the
       Inline-&gtbind() method into a private namespace.
       6. If step 5 was successful, set the load time, and return the list of
       loaded, available functions provided by the module.
       7. If step 5 failed, warn and return an empty list.

   unload()
	   $obj-&gtunload( $modname );

       Completely unload the module identified by $modname, and render its
       functions uncallable.

       This will actually go destroy the Inline::Wrapper::Module object, as
       well as the code module's corresponding private namespace.

       Returns $modname (TRUE) upon success, carps and returns undef on
       failure.

   run()
	   my @retvals = $obj-&gtrun( $modname, $function, @arguments );

       Run the named $function that you loaded from $modname, with the
       specified @arguments (if any).

       NOTE: If the auto_reload option is TRUE, run() will also attempt to
       reload the source script from disk before running the function, if the
       ctime of the file has changed since the last run.

       Assuming a successful compilation (you are checking for errors,
       right?), this will execute the function provided by the loaded module.
       Call syntax and everything is up to the function provided.  This simply
       executes the sub that Inline loaded as-is, but in its own private
       namespace to keep your app clean.

       Returns @retvals, consisting of the actual return values provided by
       the module function itself.  Whatever the function returns, that's what
       you get.

   modules()
	   my @modules = $obj-&gtmodules();

       Returns a list of loaded module names, or the empty list if no modules
       have been (successfully) loaded.

   functions()
	   my @functions = $obj-&gtfunctions( $modname );

       Returns a list of loaded @functions, which were made available by
       loading $modname.

ACCESSORS
       Various accessors that allow you to inspect or change the default
       settings after creating the object.

   base_dir()
	   my $base_dir = $obj-&gtbase_dir();

       Returns the default base_dir attribute from the object.

   set_base_dir()
	   $obj-&gtset_base_dir( '/some/path' );

       Sets the default base_dir attribute of the object, and returns whatever
       it ended up being set to.

       NOTE: Only affects modules loaded after this setting was made.

   auto_reload()
	   my $bool = $obj-&gtauto_reload();

       Returns a $boolean as to whether or not the default auto_reload setting
       is enabled for new modules.

   set_auto_reload()
	   $obj-&gtset_auto_reload( 1 );

       Sets the default auto_reload attribute of the object, and returns
       whatever it ended up being set to.

       NOTE: Only affects modules loaded after this setting was made.

   language()
	   my $lang = $obj-&gtlanguage();

       Returns the default language attribute of the object.

   set_language()
	   $obj-&gtset_language( 'C' );

       Sets the default language attribute of the object, and returns whatever
       it ended up being set to.

       NOTE: Only affects modules loaded after this setting was made.

       ALSO NOTE: This checks for "valid" languages via a pretty naive method.
       Currently only a couple are hard-coded.	However, you can add your own
       languages via the "add_language()" method.

   add_language()
	   $obj-&gtadd_language( 'Lojban' =&gt '.xkcd' );

       Adds a language to the "known languages" table, allowing you to later
       use "set_language()".

       This can also be used to set a new file extension for an existing
       language.

       REQUIRES a $language name (e.g. 'Python') and a filename $extension
       (e.g. '.py'), which will be used in pathname resolution, as described
       under "load()".

       Returns TRUE if successful, carps and returns FALSE otherwise.
