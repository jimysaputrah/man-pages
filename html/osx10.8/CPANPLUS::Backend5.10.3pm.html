DESCRIPTION
       This module provides the programmer's interface to the "CPANPLUS"
       libraries.

ENVIRONMENT
       When "CPANPLUS::Backend" is loaded, which is necessary for just about
       every <CPANPLUS> operation, the environment variable
       "PERL5_CPANPLUS_IS_RUNNING" is set to the current process id.

       Additionally, the environment variable "PERL5_CPANPLUS_IS_VERSION" will
       be set to the version of "CPANPLUS::Backend".

       This information might be useful somehow to spawned processes.

METHODS
   $cb = CPANPLUS::Backend->new( [CONFIGURE_OBJ] )
       This method returns a new "CPANPLUS::Backend" object.  This also
       initialises the config corresponding to this object.  You have two
       choices in this:

       Provide a valid "CPANPLUS::Configure" object
	   This will be used verbatim.

       No arguments
	   Your default config will be loaded and used.

       New will return a "CPANPLUS::Backend" object on success and die on
       failure.

   $href = $cb->module_tree( [@modules_names_list] )
       Returns a reference to the CPANPLUS module tree.

       If you give it any arguments, they will be treated as module names and
       "module_tree" will try to look up these module names and return the
       corresponding module objects instead.

       See CPANPLUS::Module for the operations you can perform on a module
       object.

   $href = $cb->author_tree( [@author_names_list] )
       Returns a reference to the CPANPLUS author tree.

       If you give it any arguments, they will be treated as author names and
       "author_tree" will try to look up these author names and return the
       corresponding author objects instead.

       See CPANPLUS::Module::Author for the operations you can perform on an
       author object.

   $conf = $cb->configure_object;
       Returns a copy of the "CPANPLUS::Configure" object.

       See CPANPLUS::Configure for operations you can perform on a configure
       object.

   $su = $cb->selfupdate_object;
       Returns a copy of the "CPANPLUS::Selfupdate" object.

       See the CPANPLUS::Selfupdate manpage for the operations you can perform
       on the selfupdate object.

   @mods = $cb->search( type => TYPE, allow => AREF, [data => AREF, verbose =>
       BOOL] )
       "search" enables you to search for either module or author objects,
       based on their data. The "type" you can specify is any of the accessors
       specified in "CPANPLUS::Module::Author" or "CPANPLUS::Module". "search"
       will determine by the "type" you specified whether to search by author
       object or module object.

       You have to specify an array reference of regular expressions or
       strings to match against. The rules used for this array ref are the
       same as in "Params::Check", so read that manpage for details.

       The search is an "or" search, meaning that if "any" of the criteria
       match, the search is considered to be successful.

       You can specify the result of a previous search as "data" to limit the
       new search to these module or author objects, rather than the entire
       module or author tree.  This is how you do "and" searches.

       Returns a list of module or author objects on success and false on
       failure.

       See CPANPLUS::Module for the operations you can perform on a module
       object.	See CPANPLUS::Module::Author for the operations you can
       perform on an author object.

   $backend_rv = $cb->fetch( modules => \@mods )
       Fetches a list of modules. @mods can be a list of distribution names,
       module names or module objects--basically anything that parse_module
       can understand.

       See the equivalent method in "CPANPLUS::Module" for details on other
       options you can pass.

       Since this is a multi-module method call, the return value is
       implemented as a "CPANPLUS::Backend::RV" object. Please consult that
       module's documentation on how to interpret the return value.

   $backend_rv = $cb->extract( modules => \@mods )
       Extracts a list of modules. @mods can be a list of distribution names,
       module names or module objects--basically anything that parse_module
       can understand.

       See the equivalent method in "CPANPLUS::Module" for details on other
       options you can pass.

       implemented as a "CPANPLUS::Backend::RV" object. Please consult that
       module's documentation on how to interpret the return value.

   $backend_rv = $cb->install( modules => \@mods )
       Installs a list of modules. @mods can be a list of distribution names,
       module names or module objects--basically anything that parse_module
       can understand.

       See the equivalent method in "CPANPLUS::Module" for details on other
       options you can pass.

       implemented as a "CPANPLUS::Backend::RV" object. Please consult that
       module's documentation on how to interpret the return value.

   $backend_rv = $cb->readme( modules => \@mods )
       Fetches the readme for a list of modules. @mods can be a list of
       distribution names, module names or module objects--basically anything
       that parse_module can understand.

       See the equivalent method in "CPANPLUS::Module" for details on other
       options you can pass.

       Since this is a multi-module method call, the return value is
       implemented as a "CPANPLUS::Backend::RV" object. Please consult that
       module's documentation on how to interpret the return value.

   $backend_rv = $cb->files( modules => \@mods )
       Returns a list of files used by these modules if they are installed.
       @mods can be a list of distribution names, module names or module
       objects--basically anything that parse_module can understand.

       See the equivalent method in "CPANPLUS::Module" for details on other
       options you can pass.

       Since this is a multi-module method call, the return value is
       implemented as a "CPANPLUS::Backend::RV" object. Please consult that
       module's documentation on how to interpret the return value.

   $backend_rv = $cb->distributions( modules => \@mods )
       Returns a list of module objects representing all releases for this
       module on success.  @mods can be a list of distribution names, module
       names or module objects, basically anything that parse_module can
       understand.

       See the equivalent method in "CPANPLUS::Module" for details on other
       options you can pass.

       Since this is a multi-module method call, the return value is
       implemented as a "CPANPLUS::Backend::RV" object. Please consult that
       module's documentation on how to interpret the return value.

   $mod_obj = $cb->parse_module( module => $modname|$distname|$modobj|URI|PATH
       )
       "parse_module" tries to find a "CPANPLUS::Module" object that matches
       your query. Here's a list of examples you could give to "parse_module";

       Text::Bastardize
       Text-Bastardize
       Text-Bastardize-1.06
       AYRNIEU/Text-Bastardize
       AYRNIEU/Text-Bastardize-1.06
       AYRNIEU/Text-Bastardize-1.06.tar.gz
       http://example.com/Text-Bastardize-1.06.tar.gz
       file:///tmp/Text-Bastardize-1.06.tar.gz
       /tmp/Text-Bastardize-1.06
       ./Text-Bastardize-1.06
       .

       These items would all come up with a "CPANPLUS::Module" object for
       "Text::Bastardize". The ones marked explicitly as being version 1.06
       would give back a "CPANPLUS::Module" object of that version.  Even if
       the version on CPAN is currently higher.

       The last three are examples of PATH resolution. In the first, we supply
       an absolute path to the unwrapped distribution. In the second the
       distribution is relative to the current working directory.  In the
       third, we will use the current working directory.

       If "parse_module" is unable to actually find the module you are looking
       for in its module tree, but you supplied it with an author, module and
       version part in a distribution name or URI, it will create a fake
       "CPANPLUS::Module" object for you, that you can use just like the real
       thing.

       See CPANPLUS::Module for the operations you can perform on a module
       object.

       If even this fancy guessing doesn't enable "parse_module" to create a
       fake module object for you to use, it will warn about an error and
       return false.

   $bool = $cb->reload_indices( [update_source => BOOL, verbose => BOOL] );
       This method reloads the source files.

       If "update_source" is set to true, this will fetch new source files
       from your CPAN mirror. Otherwise, "reload_indices" will do its usual
       cache checking and only update them if they are out of date.

       By default, "update_source" will be false.

       The verbose setting defaults to what you have specified in your config
       file.

       Returns true on success and false on failure.

   $bool = $cb->flush(CACHE_NAME)
       This method allows flushing of caches.  There are several things which
       can be flushed:

       o   "methods"

	   The return status of methods which have been attempted, such as
	   different ways of fetching files.  It is recommended that automatic
	   flushing be used instead.

       o   "hosts"

	   The return status of URIs which have been attempted, such as
	   different hosts of fetching files.  It is recommended that
	   automatic flushing be used instead.

       o   "modules"

	   Information about modules such as prerequisites and whether
	   installation succeeded, failed, or was not attempted.

       o   "lib"

	   This resets PERL5LIB, which is changed to ensure that while
	   installing modules they are in our @INC.

       o   "load"

	   This resets the cache of modules we've attempted to load, but
	   failed.  This enables you to load them again after a failed load,
	   if they somehow have become available.

       o   "all"

	   Flush all of the aforementioned caches.

       Returns true on success and false on failure.

   @mods = $cb->installed()
       Returns a list of module objects of all your installed modules.	If an
       error occurs, it will return false.

       See CPANPLUS::Module for the operations you can perform on a module
       object.

   $bool = $cb->local_mirror([path => '/dir/to/save/to', index_files => BOOL,
       force => BOOL, verbose => BOOL] )
       Creates a local mirror of CPAN, of only the most recent sources in a
       location you specify. If you set this location equal to a custom host
       in your "CPANPLUS::Config" you can use your local mirror to install
       from.

       It takes the following arguments:

       path
	   The location where to create the local mirror.

       index_files
	   Enable/disable fetching of index files. You can disable fetching of
	   the index files if you don't plan to use the local mirror as your
	   primary site, or if you'd like up-to-date index files be fetched
	   from elsewhere.

	   Defaults to true.

       force
	   Forces refetching of packages, even if they are there already.

	   Defaults to whatever setting you have in your "CPANPLUS::Config".

       verbose
	   Prints more messages about what its doing.

	   Defaults to whatever setting you have in your "CPANPLUS::Config".

       Returns true on success and false on error.

   $file = $cb->autobundle([path => OUTPUT_PATH, force => BOOL, verbose =>
       BOOL])
       Writes out a snapshot of your current installation in "CPAN" bundle
       style. This can then be used to install the same modules for a
       different or on a different machine by issuing the following commands:

	   ### using the default shell:
	   CPAN Terminal> i file://path/to/Snapshot_XXYY.pm

	   ### using the API
	   $modobj = $cb->parse_module( module => 'file://path/to/Snapshot_XXYY.pm' );
	   $modobj->install;

       It will, by default, write to an 'autobundle' directory under your
       cpanplus homedirectory, but you can override that by supplying a "path"
       argument.

       It will return the location of the output file on success and false on
       failure.

   $bool = $cb->save_state
       Explicit command to save memory state to disk. This can be used to save
       information to disk about where a module was extracted, the result of
       "make test", etc. This will then be re-loaded into memory when a new
       session starts.

       The capability of saving state to disk depends on the source engine
       being used (See "CPANPLUS::Config" for the option to choose your source
       engine). The default storage engine supports this option.

       Most users will not need this command, but it can handy for automated
       systems like setting up CPAN smoke testers.

       The method will return true if it managed to save the state to disk, or
       false if it did not.

CUSTOM MODULE SOURCES
       Besides the sources as provided by the general "CPAN" mirrors, it's
       possible to add your own sources list to your "CPANPLUS" index.

       The methodology behind this works much like "Debian's apt-sources".

       The methods below show you how to make use of this functionality. Also
       note that most of these methods are available through the default shell
       plugin command "/cs", making them available as shortcuts through the
       shell and via the commandline.

   %files = $cb->list_custom_sources
       Returns a mapping of registered custom sources and their local indices
       as follows:

	   /full/path/to/local/index => http://remote/source

       Note that any file starting with an "#" is being ignored.

   $local_index = $cb->add_custom_source( uri => URI, [verbose => BOOL] );
       Adds an "URI" to your own sources list and mirrors its index. See the
       documentation on "$cb->update_custom_source" on how this is done.

       Returns the full path to the local index on success, or false on
       failure.

       Note that when adding a new "URI", the change to the in-memory tree is
       not saved until you rebuild or save the tree to disk again. You can do
       this using the "$cb->reload_indices" method.

   $local_index = $cb->remove_custom_source( uri => URI, [verbose => BOOL] );
       Removes an "URI" from your own sources list and removes its index.

       To find out what "URI"s you have as part of your own sources list, use
       the "$cb->list_custom_sources" method.

       Returns the full path to the deleted local index file on success, or
       false on failure.

   $bool = $cb->update_custom_source( [remote => URI] );
       Updates the indexes for all your custom sources. It does this by
       fetching a file called "packages.txt" in the root of the custom
       sources's "URI".  If you provide the "remote" argument, it will only
       update the index for that specific "URI".

       Here's an example of how custom sources would resolve into index files:

	 file:///path/to/sources       =>  file:///path/to/sources/packages.txt
	 http://example.com/sources    =>  http://example.com/sources/packages.txt
	 ftp://example.com/sources     =>  ftp://example.com/sources/packages.txt

       The file "packages.txt" simply holds a list of packages that can be
       found under the root of the "URI". This file can be automatically
       generated for you when the remote source is a "file:// URI". For
       "http://", "ftp://", and similar, the administrator of that repository
       should run the method "$cb->write_custom_source_index" on the
       repository to allow remote users to index it.

       For details, see the "$cb->write_custom_source_index" method below.

       All packages that are added via this mechanism will be attributed to
       the author with "CPANID" "LOCAL". You can use this id to search for all
       added packages.

   $file = $cb->write_custom_source_index( path => /path/to/package/root, [to
       => /path/to/index/file, verbose => BOOL] );
       Writes the index for a custom repository root. Most users will not have
       to worry about this, but administrators of a repository will need to
       make sure their indexes are up to date.

       The index will be written to a file called "packages.txt" in your
       repository root, which you can specify with the "path" argument. You
       can override this location by specifying the "to" argument, but in
       normal operation, that should not be required.

       Once the index file is written, users can then add the "URI" pointing
       to the repository to their custom list of sources and start using it
       right away. See the "$cb->add_custom_source" method for user details.
