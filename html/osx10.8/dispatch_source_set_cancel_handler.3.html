DESCRIPTION
     Dispatch event sources may be used to monitor a variety of system objects
     and events including file descriptors, mach ports, processes, virtual
     filesystem nodes, signal delivery and timers.

     When a state change occurs, the dispatch source will submit its event
     handler block to its target queue.

     The dispatch_source_create() function creates a new dispatch source
     object that may be retained and released with calls to dispatch_retain()
     and dispatch_release() respectively. The queue parameter specifies the
     target queue of the new source object, it will be retained by the source
     object. Pass the DISPATCH_TARGET_QUEUE_DEFAULT constant to use the
     default target queue (the default priority global concurrent queue).

     Newly created sources are created in a suspended state. After the source
     has been configured by setting an event handler, cancellation handler,
     registration handler, context, etc., the source must be activated by a
     call to dispatch_resume() before any events will be delivered.

     Dispatch sources may be one of the following types:
	   o   DISPATCH_SOURCE_TYPE_DATA_ADD
	   o   DISPATCH_SOURCE_TYPE_DATA_OR
	   o   DISPATCH_SOURCE_TYPE_MACH_SEND
	   o   DISPATCH_SOURCE_TYPE_MACH_RECV
	   o   DISPATCH_SOURCE_TYPE_PROC
	   o   DISPATCH_SOURCE_TYPE_READ
	   o   DISPATCH_SOURCE_TYPE_SIGNAL
	   o   DISPATCH_SOURCE_TYPE_TIMER
	   o   DISPATCH_SOURCE_TYPE_VNODE
	   o   DISPATCH_SOURCE_TYPE_WRITE

     The handle and mask arguments to dispatch_source_create() and the return
     values of the dispatch_source_get_handle(), dispatch_source_get_mask(),
     and dispatch_source_get_data() functions should be interpreted according
     to the type of the dispatch source.

     The dispatch_source_get_handle() function returns the underlying handle
     to the dispatch source (i.e. file descriptor, mach port, process identi-
     fer, etc.). The result of this function may be cast directly to the
     underlying type.

     The dispatch_source_get_mask() function returns the set of flags that
     were specified at source creation time via the mask argument.

     The dispatch_source_get_data() function returns the currently pending
     data for the dispatch source.  This function should only be called from
     within the source's event handler.  The result of calling this function
     from any other context is undefined.

     The dispatch_source_merge_data() function is intended for use with the
     DISPATCH_SOURCE_TYPE_DATA_ADD and DISPATCH_SOURCE_TYPE_DATA_OR source
     types. The result of using this function with any other source type is
     undefined. Calling this function will atomically add or logical OR the
     data into the source's data, and trigger the delivery of the source's
     event handler.

SOURCE EVENT HANDLERS
     In order to receive events from the dispatch source, an event handler
     should be specified via dispatch_source_set_event_handler().  The event
     handler block is submitted to the source's target queue when the state of
     the underlying system handle changes, or when an event occurs. If a
     source is resumed with no event handler block set, events will be quietly
     ignored.  If the event handler block is changed while the source is sus-
     pended, or from a block running on a serial queue that is the source's
     target queue, then the next event handler invocation will use the new
     block.

     Dispatch sources may be suspended or resumed independently of their tar-
     get queues using dispatch_suspend() and dispatch_resume() on the dispatch
     source directly. The data describing events which occur while a source is
     suspended are coalesced and delivered once the source is resumed.

     The handler block need not be reentrant safe, as it is not resubmitted to
     the target queue until any prior invocation for that dispatch source has
     completed.  When the handler is set, the dispatch source will perform a
     Block_copy() on the handler block.

     To unset the event handler, call dispatch_source_set_event_handler_f()
     and pass NULL as function.  This unsets the event handler regardless of
     whether the handler was a function pointer or a block. Registration and
     cancellation handlers (see below) may be unset in the same way, but as
     noted below, a cancellation handler may be required.

REGISTRATION
     When dispatch_resume() is called on a suspended or newly created source,
     there may be a brief delay before the source is ready to receive events
     from the underlying system handle.  During this delay, the event handler
     will not be invoked, and events will be missed.

     Once the dispatch source is registered with the underlying system and is
     ready to process all events its optional registration handler will be
     submitted to its target queue. This registration handler may be specified
     via dispatch_source_set_registration_handler().

     The event handler will not be called until the registration handler fin-
     ishes.  If the source is canceled (see below) before it is registered,
     its registration handler will not be called.

CANCELLATION
     The dispatch_source_cancel() function asynchronously cancels the dispatch
     source, preventing any further invocation of its event handler block.
     Cancellation does not interrupt a currently executing handler block (non-
     preemptive). If a source is canceled before the first time it is resumed,
     its event handler will never be called.  (In this case, note that the
     source must be resumed before it can be released.)

     The dispatch_source_testcancel() function may be used to determine
     whether the specified source has been canceled. A non-zero value will be
     returned if the source is canceled.

     When a dispatch source is canceled its optional cancellation handler will
     be submitted to its target queue. The cancellation handler may be speci-
     fied via dispatch_source_set_cancel_handler().  This cancellation handler
     is invoked only once, and only as a direct consequence of calling
     dispatch_source_cancel().

     Important: a cancellation handler is required for file descriptor and
     mach port based sources in order to safely close the descriptor or
     destroy the port. Closing the descriptor or port before the cancellation
     handler has run may result in a race condition: if a new descriptor is
     allocated with the same value as the recently closed descriptor while the
     source's event handler is still running, the event handler may read/write
     data to the wrong descriptor.

DISPATCH SOURCE TYPES
     The following section contains a summary of supported dispatch event
     types and the interpretation of their parameters and returned data.

     DISPATCH_SOURCE_TYPE_DATA_ADD, DISPATCH_SOURCE_TYPE_DATA_OR

     Sources of this type allow applications to manually trigger the source's
     event handler via a call to dispatch_source_merge_data().	The data will
     be merged with the source's pending data via an atomic add or logic OR
     (based on the source's type), and the event handler block will be submit-
     ted to the source's target queue. The data is application defined. These
     sources have no handle or mask and zero should be used.

     DISPATCH_SOURCE_TYPE_MACH_SEND

     Sources of this type monitor a mach port with a send right for state
     changes.  The handle is the mach port (mach_port_t) to monitor and the
     mask may be:
	   o DISPATCH_MACH_SEND_DEAD
				   The port's corresponding receive right has
				   been destroyed

     The data returned by dispatch_source_get_data() indicates which of the
     events in the mask were observed.

     DISPATCH_SOURCE_TYPE_MACH_RECV

     Sources of this type monitor a mach port with a receive right for state
     changes.  The handle is the mach port (mach_port_t) to monitor and the
     mask is unused and should be zero.  The event handler block will be sub-
     mitted to the target queue when a message on the mach port is waiting to
     be received.

     DISPATCH_SOURCE_TYPE_PROC

     Sources of this type monitor processes for state changes.	The handle is
     the process identifier (pid_t) of the process to monitor and the mask may
     be one or more of the following:
	   o DISPATCH_PROC_EXIT    The process has exited and is available to
				   wait(2).
	   o DISPATCH_PROC_FORK    The process has created one or more child
				   processes.
	   o DISPATCH_PROC_EXEC    The process has become another executable
				   image via a call to execve(2) or
				   posix_spawn(2).
	   o DISPATCH_PROC_REAP    The process status has been collected by
				   its parent process via wait(2).
	   o DISPATCH_PROC_SIGNAL  A signal was delivered to the process.

     The data returned by dispatch_source_get_data() indicates which of the
     events in the mask were observed.

     DISPATCH_SOURCE_TYPE_READ

     Sources of this type monitor file descriptors for pending data.  The
     handle is the file descriptor (int) to monitor and the mask is unused and
     should be zero.

     The data returned by dispatch_source_get_data() is an estimated number of
     bytes available to be read from the descriptor. This estimate should be
     treated as a suggested minimum read buffer size. There are no guarantees
     that a complete read of this size will be performed.

     Users of this source type are strongly encouraged to perform non-blocking
     I/O and handle any truncated reads or error conditions that may occur.
     See fcntl(2) for additional information about setting the O_NONBLOCK flag
     on a file descriptor.

     DISPATCH_SOURCE_TYPE_SIGNAL

     Sources of this type monitor signals delivered to the current process.
     The handle is the signal number to monitor (int) and the mask is unused
     and should be zero.

     The data returned by dispatch_source_get_data() is the number of signals
     received since the last invocation of the event handler block.

     Unlike signal handlers specified via sigaction(), the execution of the
     event handler block does not interrupt the current thread of execution;
     therefore the handler block is not limited to the use of signal safe
     interfaces defined in sigaction(2).  Furthermore, multiple observers of a
     given signal are supported; thus allowing applications and libraries to
     cooperate safely. However, a dispatch source does not install a signal
     handler or otherwise alter the behavior of signal delivery.  Therefore,
     applications must ignore or at least catch any signal that terminates a
     process by default. For example, near the top of main():

	  signal(SIGTERM, SIG_IGN);

     DISPATCH_SOURCE_TYPE_TIMER

     Sources of this type periodically submit the event handler block to the
     target queue on an interval specified by dispatch_source_set_timer().
     The handle and mask arguments are unused and should be zero.

     A best effort attempt is made to submit the event handler block to the
     target queue at the specified time; however, actual invocation may occur
     at a later time.

     The data returned by dispatch_source_get_data() is the number of times
     the timer has fired since the last invocation of the event handler block.

     The function dispatch_source_set_timer() takes as an argument the start
     time of the timer (initial fire time) represented as a dispatch_time_t.
     The timer dispatch source will use the same clock as the function used to
     create this value. (See dispatch_time(3) for more information.) The
     interval, in nanoseconds, specifies the period at which the timer should
     repeat. All timers will repeat indefinitely until
     dispatch_source_cancel() is called. The leeway, in nanoseconds, is a hint
     to the system that it may defer the timer in order to align with other
     system activity for improved system performance or reduced power consump-
     tion. (For example, an application might perform a periodic task every 5
     minutes with a leeway of up to 30 seconds.) Note that some latency is to
     be expected for all timers even when a value of zero is used.

     Note: Under the C language, untyped numbers default to the int type. This
     can lead to truncation bugs when arithmetic operations with other numbers
     are expected to generate a uint64_t sized result. When in doubt, use ull
     as a suffix. For example:

	   3ull * NSEC_PER_SEC

     DISPATCH_SOURCE_TYPE_VNODE

     Sources of this type monitor the virtual filesystem nodes for state
     changes.  The handle is a file descriptor (int) referencing the node to
     monitor, and the mask may be one or more of the following:
	   o DISPATCH_VNODE_DELETE  The referenced node was removed from the
				    filesystem namespace via unlink(2).
	   o DISPATCH_VNODE_WRITE   A write to the referenced file occurred
	   o DISPATCH_VNODE_EXTEND  The referenced file was extended
	   o DISPATCH_VNODE_ATTRIB  The metadata attributes of the referenced
				    node have changed
	   o DISPATCH_VNODE_LINK    The link count on the referenced node has
				    changed
	   o DISPATCH_VNODE_RENAME  The referenced node was renamed
	   o DISPATCH_VNODE_REVOKE  Access to the referenced node was revoked
				    via revoke(2) or the underlying fileystem
				    was unmounted.

     The data returned by dispatch_source_get_data() indicates which of the
     events in the mask were observed.

     DISPATCH_SOURCE_TYPE_WRITE

     Sources of this type monitor file descriptors for available write buffer
     space.  The handle is the file descriptor (int) to monitor and the mask
     is unused and should be zero.

     Users of this source type are strongly encouraged to perform non-blocking
     I/O and handle any truncated reads or error conditions that may occur.
     See fcntl(2) for additional information about setting the O_NONBLOCK flag
     on a file descriptor.
