NAME
       Crypt::OpenSSL::RSA - RSA encoding and decoding, using the openSSL
       libraries

       Crypt::OpenSSL::Random - Routines for accessing the OpenSSL
       pseudo-random number generator

SYNOPSIS
	 use Crypt::OpenSSL::Random;

	 Crypt::OpenSSL::Random::random_seed($good_random_data);
	 Crypt::OpenSSL::Random::random_egd("/tmp/entropy");
	 Crypt::OpenSSL::Random::random_status() or
	   die "Unable to sufficiently seed the random number generator".

	 my $ten_good_random_bytes = Crypt::OpenSSL::Random::random_bytes(10);
	 my $ten_ok_random_bytes = Crypt::OpenSSL::Random::random_pseudo_bytes(10);

DESCRIPTION
       Crypt::OpenSSL::Random provides the ability to seed and query the
       OpenSSL library's pseudo-random number generator

   EXPORT
       None by default.

Static Methods
       random_bytes
	   This function, returns a specified number of cryptographically
	   strong pseudo-random bytes from the PRNG.  If the PRNG has not been
	   seeded with enough randomness to ensure an unpredictable byte
	   sequence, then a false value is returned.

       random_pseudo_bytes
	   This function, is similar to c&ltrandom_bytes&gt, but the resulting
	   sequence of bytes are not necessarily unpredictable.  They can be
	   used for non-cryptographic purposes and for certain purposes in
	   cryptographic protocols, but usually not for key generation etc.

       random_seed
	   This function seeds the PRNG with a supplied string of bytes.  It
	   returns true if the PRNG has sufficient seeding.  Note: calling
	   this function with non-random bytes is of limited value at best!

       random_egd
	   This function seeds the PRNG with data from the specified entropy
	   gathering daemon.  Returns the number of bytes read from the daemon
	   on succes, or -1 if not enough bytes were read, or if the
	   connection to the daemon failed.

       random_status
	   This function returns true if the PRNG has sufficient seeding.

BUGS
       Because of the internal workings of OpenSSL's random library, the
       pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) accessed by
       Crypt::OpenSSL::Random will be different than the one accessed by any
       other perl module.  Hence, to use a module such as
       Crypt::OpenSSL::Random, you will need to seed the PRNG used there from
       one used here.  This class is still advantageous, however, as it
       centralizes other methods, such as random_egd, in one place.
