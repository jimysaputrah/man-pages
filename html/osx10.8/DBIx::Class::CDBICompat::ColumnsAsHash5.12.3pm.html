NAME
       DBIx::Class::CDBICompat::ColumnsAsHash - Emulates the behavior of
       Class::DBI where the object can be accessed as a hash of columns.

SYNOPSIS
       See DBIx::Class::CDBICompat for usage directions.

DESCRIPTION
       Emulates the undocumnted behavior of Class::DBI where the object can be
       accessed as a hash of columns.  This is often used as a performance
       hack.

	   my $column = $row->{column};

   Differences from Class::DBI
       If "DBIC_CDBICOMPAT_HASH_WARN" is true it will warn when a column is
       accessed as a hash key.
