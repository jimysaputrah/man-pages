NAME
       MIME::Decoder::Base64 - encode/decode a "base64" stream

SYNOPSIS
       A generic decoder object; see MIME::Decoder for usage.

DESCRIPTION
       A MIME::Decoder subclass for the "base64" encoding.  The name was
       chosen to jibe with the pre-existing MIME::Base64 utility package,
       which this class actually uses to translate each chunk.

       o   When decoding, the input is read one line at a time.  The input
	   accumulates in an internal buffer, which is decoded in
	   multiple-of-4-sized chunks (plus a possible "leftover" input chunk,
	   of course).

       o   When encoding, the input is read 45 bytes at a time: this ensures
	   that the output lines are not too long.   We chose 45 since it is a
	   multiple of 3 and produces lines under 76 characters, as RFC 2045
	   specifies:
	       The encoded output stream must be represented in lines of no
	   more
	       than 76 characters each.
