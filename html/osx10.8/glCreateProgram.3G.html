NAME
       glCreateProgram - Creates a program object

C SPECIFICATION
       GLuint glCreateProgram(void);

DESCRIPTION
       glCreateProgram creates an empty program object and returns a non-zero
       value by which it can be referenced. A program object is an object to
       which shader objects can be attached. This provides a mechanism to
       specify the shader objects that will be linked to create a program. It
       also provides a means for checking the compatibility of the shaders
       that will be used to create a program (for instance, checking the
       compatibility between a vertex shader and a fragment shader). When no
       longer needed as part of a program object, shader objects can be
       detached.

       One or more executables are created in a program object by successfully
       attaching shader objects to it with glAttachShader(), successfully
       compiling the shader objects with glCompileShader(), and successfully
       linking the program object with glLinkProgram(). These executables are
       made part of current state when glUseProgram() is called. Program
       objects can be deleted by calling glDeleteProgram(). The memory
       associated with the program object will be deleted when it is no longer
       part of current rendering state for any context.

NOTES
       Like buffer and texture objects, the name space for program objects may
       be shared across a set of contexts, as long as the server sides of the
       contexts share the same address space. If the name space is shared
       across contexts, any attached objects and the data associated with
       those attached objects are shared as well.

       Applications are responsible for providing the synchronization across
       API calls when objects are accessed from different execution threads.

ERRORS
       This function returns 0 if an error occurs creating the program object.
