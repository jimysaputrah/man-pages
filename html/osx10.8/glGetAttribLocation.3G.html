GLGETATTRIBLOCATION(3G) 	  OpenGL 3.3	       GLGETATTRIBLOCATION(3G)



NAME
       glGetAttribLocation - Returns the location of an attribute variable

C SPECIFICATION
       GLint glGetAttribLocation(GLuint program, const GLchar *name);

PARAMETERS
       program
	   Specifies the program object to be queried.

       name
	   Points to a null terminated string containing the name of the
	   attribute variable whose location is to be queried.

DESCRIPTION
       glGetAttribLocation queries the previously linked program object
       specified by program for the attribute variable specified by name and
       returns the index of the generic vertex attribute that is bound to that
       attribute variable. If name is a matrix attribute variable, the index
       of the first column of the matrix is returned. If the named attribute
       variable is not an active attribute in the specified program object or
       if name starts with the reserved prefix "gl_", a value of -1 is
       returned.

       The association between an attribute variable name and a generic
       attribute index can be specified at any time by calling
       glBindAttribLocation(). Attribute bindings do not go into effect until
       glLinkProgram() is called. After a program object has been linked
       successfully, the index values for attribute variables remain fixed
       until the next link command occurs. The attribute values can only be
       queried after a link if the link was successful.  glGetAttribLocation
       returns the binding that actually went into effect the last time
       glLinkProgram() was called for the specified program object. Attribute
       bindings that have been specified since the last link operation are not
       returned by glGetAttribLocation.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if program is not a value generated
       by OpenGL.

       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if program is not a program object.

       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if program has not been successfully
       linked.

ASSOCIATED GETS
       glGetActiveAttrib() with argument program and the index of an active
       attribute

       glIsProgram()
