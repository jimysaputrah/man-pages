NAME
       Moose::Object - The base object for Moose

VERSION
       version 2.0205

DESCRIPTION
       This class is the default base class for all Moose-using classes. When
       you "use Moose" in this class, your class will inherit from this class.

       It provides a default constructor and destructor, which run all of the
       "BUILD" and "DEMOLISH" methods in the inheritance hierarchy,
       respectively.

       You don't actually need to inherit from this in order to use Moose, but
       it makes it easier to take advantage of all of Moose's features.

METHODS
       Moose::Object-&gtnew(%params|$params)
	   This method calls "$class-&gtBUILDARGS(@_)", and then creates a new
	   instance of the appropriate class. Once the instance is created, it
	   calls "$instance-&gtBUILD($params)" for each "BUILD" method in the
	   inheritance hierarchy.

       Moose::Object-&gtBUILDARGS(%params|$params)
	   The default implementation of this method accepts a hash or hash
	   reference of named parameters. If it receives a single argument
	   that isn't a hash reference it throws an error.

	   You can override this method in your class to handle other types of
	   options passed to the constructor.

	   This method should always return a hash reference of named options.

       $object-&gtdoes($role_name)
	   This returns true if the object does the given role.

       $object-&gtDOES($class_or_role_name)
	   This is a a Moose role-aware implementation of "DOES" in UNIVERSAL.

	   This is effectively the same as writing:

	     $object-&gtdoes($name) || $object-&gtisa($name)

	   This method will work with Perl 5.8, which did not implement
	   "UNIVERSAL::DOES".

       $object-&gtdump($maxdepth)
	   This is a handy utility for "Data::Dumper"ing an object. By
	   default, the maximum depth is 1, to avoid making a mess.

       $object-&gtDESTROY
	   A default destructor is provided, which calls
	   "$instance-&gtDEMOLISH($in_global_destruction)" for each "DEMOLISH"
	   method in the inheritance hierarchy.

       See "BUGS" in Moose for details on reporting bugs.
