NAME
       glDeleteTextures - delete named textures


C SPECIFICATION
       void glDeleteTextures( GLsizei n,
			      const GLuint *textures )


PARAMETERS
       n	 Specifies the number of textures to be deleted.

       textures  Specifies an array of textures to be deleted.

DESCRIPTION
       glDeleteTextures  deletes n textures named by the elements of the array
       textures.  After a texture is deleted, it has no contents or dimension-
       ality,  and  its name is free for reuse (for example by glGenTextures).
       If a texture that is currently bound is deleted, the binding reverts to
       0 (the default texture).

       glDeleteTextures  silently ignores 0's and names that do not correspond
       to existing textures.

NOTES
       glDeleteTextures is available only if the GL version is 1.1 or greater.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if n is negative.

       GL_INVALID_OPERATION  is  generated  if	glDeleteTextures  is  executed
       between the execution of glBegin and  the  corresponding  execution  of
       glEnd.

ASSOCIATED GETS
