DESCRIPTION
       This module contains defaults and heuristics for configuration
       information for CPANPLUS. To change any of these values, please see the
       documentation in "CPANPLUS::Configure".

       Below you'll find a list of configuration types and keys, and their
       meaning.

CONFIGURATION
   Section 'conf'
       hosts
	   An array ref containing hosts entries to be queried for packages.

	   An example entry would like this:

	       {   'scheme' => 'ftp',
		   'path' => '/pub/CPAN/',
		   'host' => 'ftp.cpan.org'
	       },

       allow_build_interactivity
	   Boolean flag to indicate whether 'perl Makefile.PL' and similar are
	   run interactively or not. Defaults to 'true'.

       base
	   The directory CPANPLUS keeps all its build and state information
	   in.	Defaults to ~/.cpanplus.

       buildflags

	   Module::Build" for details. Defaults to an empty string.

       cpantest
	   Boolean flag to indicate whether or not to mail test results of
	   module installations to "http://testers.cpan.org". Defaults to
	   'false'.

       cpantest_mx
	   String holding an explicit mailserver to use when sending out
	   emails for "http://testers.cpan.org". An empty string will use your
	   system settings. Defaults to an empty string.

       debug
	   Boolean flag to enable or disable extensive debuggging information.
	   Defaults to 'false'.

       dist_type
	   Default distribution type to use when building packages. See
	   "cpan2dist" or "CPANPLUS::Dist" for details. An empty string will
	   not use any package building software. Defaults to an empty string.

       email
	   Email address to use for anonymous ftp access and as "from" address
	   when sending emails. Defaults to an "example.com" address.

       enable_custom_sources
	   Boolean flag indicating whether custom sources should be enabled or
	   not. See the "CUSTOM MODULE SOURCES" in "CPANPLUS::Backend" for
	   details on how to use them.

	   Defaults to "true"

       extractdir
	   String containing the directory where fetched archives should be
	   extracted. An empty string will use a directory under your "base"
	   directory. Defaults to an empty string.

       fetchdir
	   String containing the directory where fetched archives should be
	   stored. An empty string will use a directory under your "base"
	   directory. Defaults to an empty string.

       flush
	   Boolean indicating whether build failures, cache dirs etc should be
	   flushed after every operation or not. Defaults to 'true'.

       force
	   Boolean indicating whether files should be forcefully overwritten
	   if they exist, modules should be installed when they fail tests,
	   etc. Defaults to 'false'.

       lib An array ref holding directories to be added to @INC when CPANPLUS
	   starts up. Defaults to an empty array reference.

       makeflags
	   A string holding flags that will be passed to the "make" program
	   when invoked. Defaults to an empty string.

       makemakerflags
	   A string holding flags that will be passed to "perl Makefile.PL"
	   when invoked. Defaults to an empty string.

       md5 A boolean indicating whether or not md5 checks should be done when
	   an archive is fetched. Defaults to 'true' if you have "Digest::MD5"
	   installed, 'false' otherwise.

       no_update
	   A boolean indicating whether or not "CPANPLUS"' source files should
	   be updated or not. Defaults to 'false'.

       passive
	   A boolean indicating whether or not to use passive ftp connections.
	   Defaults to 'true'.

       prefer_bin
	   A boolean indicating whether or not to prefer command line programs
	   over perl modules. Defaults to 'false' unless you do not have
	   "Compress::Zlib" installed (as that would mean we could not extract
	   ".tar.gz" files)

       prefer_makefile
	   A boolean indicating whether or not prefer a "Makefile.PL" over a
	   "Build.PL" file if both are present. Defaults to 'true'.

       prereqs
	   A digit indicating what to do when a package you are installing has
	   a prerequisite. Options are:

	       0   Do not install
	       1   Install
	       2   Ask
	       3   Ignore  (dangerous, install will probably fail!)

	   The default is to ask.

       shell
	   A string holding the shell class you wish to start up when starting
	   "CPANPLUS" in interactive mode.

	   Defaults to "CPANPLUS::Shell::Default", the default CPANPLUS shell.

       show_startup_tip

	   "Crypt::OpenPGP" installed, 'false' otherwise.

       skiptest
	   A boolean indicating whether or not to skip tests when installing
	   modules.  Defaults to 'false'.

       storable
	   A boolean indicating whether or not to use "Storable" to write
	   compiled source file information to disk. This makes for faster
	   startup and look up times, but takes extra diskspace. Defaults to
	   'true' if you have "Storable" installed and 'false' if you don't.

       timeout
	   Digit indicating the time before a fetch request times out (in
	   seconds).  Defaults to 300.

       verbose
	   A boolean indicating whether or not "CPANPLUS" runs in verbose
	   mode.  Defaults to 'true' if you have the environment variable
	   "PERL5_CPANPLUS_VERBOSE" set to true, 'false' otherwise.

	   It is recommended you run with verbose enabled, but it is disabled
	   for historical reasons.

       write_install_log
	   A boolean indicating whether or not to write install logs after
	   installing a module using the interactive shell. Defaults to
	   'true'.

       source_engine
	   Class to use as the source engine, which is generally a subclass of
	   "CPANPLUS::Internals::Source". Default to
	   "CPANPLUS::Internals::Source::Memory".

       cpantest_reporter_args
	   A hashref of key => value pairs that are passed to the constructor
	   of "Test::Reporter". If you'd want to enable TLS for example, you'd
	   set it to:

	     { transport       => 'Net::SMTP::TLS',
	       transport_args  => [ User => 'Joe', Password => '123' ],
	     }

   Section 'program'
       editor
	   A string holding the path to your editor of choice. Defaults to
	   your $ENV{EDITOR}, $ENV{VISUAL}, 'vi' or 'pico' programs, in that
	   order.

       make
	   A string holding the path to your "make" binary. Looks for the
	   "make" program used to build perl or failing that, a "make" in your
	   path.

       pager
	   A string holding the path to your pager of choice. Defaults to your
	   $ENV{PAGER}, 'less' or 'more' programs, in that order.

       shell
	   A string holding the path to your login shell of choice. Defaults
	   to your $ENV{SHELL} setting, or $ENV{COMSPEC} on Windows.

       sudo
	   A string holding the path to your "sudo" binary if your install
	   path requires super user permissions. Looks for "sudo" in your
	   path, or remains empty if you do not require super user permissiosn
	   to install.

       perlwrapper
	   A string holding the path to the "cpanp-run-perl" utility bundled
	   with CPANPLUS, which is used to enable autoflushing in spawned
	   processes.
