NAME
       IO::Socket::UNIX - Object interface for AF_UNIX domain sockets

SYNOPSIS
	   use IO::Socket::UNIX;

DESCRIPTION
       "IO::Socket::UNIX" provides an object interface to creating and using
       sockets in the AF_UNIX domain. It is built upon the IO::Socket
       interface and inherits all the methods defined by IO::Socket.

CONSTRUCTOR
       new ( [ARGS] )
	   Creates an "IO::Socket::UNIX" object, which is a reference to a
	   newly created symbol (see the "Symbol" package). "new" optionally
	   takes arguments, these arguments are in key-value pairs.

	   In addition to the key-value pairs accepted by IO::Socket,
	   "IO::Socket::UNIX" provides.

	       Type	   Type of socket (eg SOCK_STREAM or SOCK_DGRAM)
	       Local	   Path to local fifo
	       Peer	   Path to peer fifo
	       Listen	   Create a listen socket

	   If the constructor is only passed a single argument, it is assumed
	   to be a "Peer" specification.

	    NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE

	   As of VERSION 1.18 all IO::Socket objects have autoflush turned on
	   by default. This was not the case with earlier releases.

	    NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE

METHODS
       hostpath()
	   Returns the pathname to the fifo at the local end

       peerpath()
	   Returns the pathanme to the fifo at the peer end
