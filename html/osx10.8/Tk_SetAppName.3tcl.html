DESCRIPTION
       Tk_SetAppName associates a name with a given  application  and  records
       that  association on the display containing with the application's main
       window.	After this procedure has been invoked, other  applications  on
       the  display  will be able to use the send command to invoke operations
       in the application.  If name is already in use by some  other  applica-
       tion  on  the display, then a new name will be generated by appending "
       #2" to name;  if this name is also in use, the number  will  be	incre-
       mented until an unused name is found.  The return value from the proce-
       dure is a pointer to the name actually used.

       If the application already has a name  when  Tk_SetAppName  is  called,
       then the new name replaces the old name.

       Tk_SetAppName  also  adds  a  send  command to the application's inter-
       preter, which can be used to send commands  from  this  application  to
       others on any of the displays where the application has windows.

       The  application's  name registration persists until the interpreter is
       deleted or the send command is deleted from interp, at which point  the
       name is automatically unregistered and the application becomes inacces-
       sible via send.	The application can be made accessible again by  call-
       ing Tk_SetAppName.

       Tk_SetAppName  is  called  automatically by Tk_Init, so applications do
       not normally need to call it explicitly.

       The command tk appname provides Tcl-level access to  the  functionality
       of Tk_SetAppName.
