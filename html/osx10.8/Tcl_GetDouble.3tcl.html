NAME
       Tcl_GetInt,  Tcl_GetDouble,  Tcl_GetBoolean  -  convert	from string to
       integer, double, or boolean

SYNOPSIS
       #include <tcl.h>

       int
       Tcl_GetInt(interp, src, intPtr)

       int
       Tcl_GetDouble(interp, src, doublePtr)

       int
       Tcl_GetBoolean(interp, src, boolPtr)

ARGUMENTS
       Tcl_Interp *interp (in)		   Interpreter	to   use   for	 error
					   reporting.

       const char *src (in)		   Textual value to be converted.

       int *intPtr (out)		   Points  to  place  to store integer
					   value converted from src.

       double *doublePtr (out)		   Points to place  to	store  double-
					   precision floating-point value con-
					   verted from src.

       int *boolPtr (out)		   Points to place  to	store  boolean
					   value  (0 or 1) converted from src.

DESCRIPTION
       These procedures convert from strings to integers  or  double-precision
       floating-point  values or booleans (represented as 0- or 1-valued inte-
       gers).  Each of the procedures takes a src argument, converts it to  an
       internal  form  of a particular type, and stores the converted value at
       the location indicated by the procedure's third argument.  If all  goes
       well,  each of the procedures returns TCL_OK.  If src does not have the
       proper syntax for the desired type then TCL_ERROR is returned, an error
       message	is  left in the interpreter's result, and nothing is stored at
       *intPtr or *doublePtr or *boolPtr.

       Tcl_GetInt expects src to consist of a collection  of  integer  digits,
       optionally signed and optionally preceded by white space.  If the first
       two characters of src after the optional white space and sign are  "0x"
       then  src  is  expected	to  be in hexadecimal form;  otherwise, if the
       first such character is "0" then src is expected to be in  octal  form;
       otherwise, src is expected to be in decimal form.

       Tcl_GetDouble  expects src to consist of a floating-point number, which
       is:  white space;  a sign; a sequence of digits;  a decimal  point;   a
       sequence  of  digits;   the letter "e"; a signed decimal exponent;  and
       more white space.  Any of the fields may be omitted,  except  that  the
       digits  either before or after the decimal point must be present and if
       the "e" is present then it must be followed by the exponent number.

       Tcl_GetBoolean expects src to specify a boolean value.  If src  is  any
       of  0,  false,  no,  or off, then Tcl_GetBoolean stores a zero value at
       *boolPtr.  If src is any of 1, true, yes, or on, then 1	is  stored  at
       *boolPtr.   Any	of  these  values  may	be abbreviated, and upper-case
       spellings are also acceptable.
