NAME
     mkdir -- make directories

SYNOPSIS
     mkdir [-pv] [-m mode] directory_name ...

DESCRIPTION
     The mkdir utility creates the directories named as operands, in the order
     specified, using mode rwxrwxrwx (0777) as modified by the current
     umask(2).

     The options are as follows:

     -m mode
	     Set the file permission bits of the final created directory to
	     the specified mode.  The mode argument can be in any of the for-
	     mats specified to the chmod(1) command.  If a symbolic mode is
	     specified, the operation characters ``+'' and ``-'' are inter-
	     preted relative to an initial mode of ``a=rwx''.

     -p      Create intermediate directories as required.  If this option is
	     not specified, the full path prefix of each operand must already
	     exist.  On the other hand, with this option specified, no error
	     will be reported if a directory given as an operand already
	     exists.  Intermediate directories are created with permission
	     bits of rwxrwxrwx (0777) as modified by the current umask, plus
	     write and search permission for the owner.

     -v      Be verbose when creating directories, listing them as they are
	     created.

     The user must have write permission in the parent directory.

DIAGNOSTICS
     The mkdir utility exits 0 on success, and &gt0 if an error occurs.

SEE ALSO
     rmdir(1)

COMPATIBILITY
     The -v option is non-standard and its use in scripts is not recommended.

STANDARDS
     The mkdir utility is expected to be IEEE Std 1003.2 (``POSIX.2'') compat-
     ible.

HISTORY
     A mkdir command appeared in Version 1 AT&T UNIX.
