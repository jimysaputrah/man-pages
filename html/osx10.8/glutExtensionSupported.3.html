NAME
       glutExtensionSupported  -  helps  to  easily  determine whether a given
       OpenGL extension is supported.

SYNTAX
       #include <GLUT/glut.h>

       int glutExtensionSupported(char *extension);

ARGUMENTS
       extension Name of OpenGL extension.

DESCRIPTION
       glutExtensionSupported helps to easily determine whether a given OpenGL
       extension is supported or not. The extension parameter names the exten-
       sion to query. The supported extensions can  also  be  determined  with
       glGetString(GL_EXTENSIONS), but glutExtensionSupported does the correct
       parsing of the returned string.

       glutExtensionSupported returns non-zero if the extension is  supported,
       zero if not supported.

       There must be a valid current window to call glutExtensionSupported.

       glutExtensionSupported only returns information about OpenGL extensions
       only. This means window system dependent extensions (for  example,  GLX
       extensions) are not reported by glutExtensionSupported.

EXAMPLE
       Here is an example of using glutExtensionSupported:

	 if (!glutExtensionSupported("GL_EXT_texture")) {
	   fprintf(stderr, "Missing the texture extension!\n");
	   exit(1);
	 }

       Notice  that  the  name	argument  includes  both the GL prefix and the
       extension family prefix (EXT).
