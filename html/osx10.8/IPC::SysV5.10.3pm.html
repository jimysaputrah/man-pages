NAME
       IPC::SysV - System V IPC constants and system calls

SYNOPSIS
	 use IPC::SysV qw(IPC_STAT IPC_PRIVATE);

DESCRIPTION
       "IPC::SysV" defines and conditionally exports all the constants defined
       in your system include files which are needed by the SysV IPC calls.
       Common ones include

	 IPC_CREATE IPC_EXCL IPC_NOWAIT IPC_PRIVATE IPC_RMID IPC_SET IPC_STAT
	 GETVAL SETVAL GETPID GETNCNT GETZCNT GETALL SETALL
	 SEM_A SEM_R SEM_UNDO
	 SHM_RDONLY SHM_RND SHMLBA

       and auxiliary ones

	 S_IRUSR S_IWUSR S_IRWXU
	 S_IRGRP S_IWGRP S_IRWXG
	 S_IROTH S_IWOTH S_IRWXO

       but your system might have more.

       ftok( PATH )
       ftok( PATH, ID )
	   Return a key based on PATH and ID, which can be used as a key for
	   "msgget", "semget" and "shmget". See ftok.

	   If ID is omitted, it defaults to 1. If a single character is given
	   for ID, the numeric value of that character is used.

       shmat( ID, ADDR, FLAG )
	   Attach the shared memory segment identified by ID to the address
	   space of the calling process. See shmat.

	   ADDR should be "undef" unless you really know what you're doing.

       shmdt( ADDR )
	   Detach the shared memory segment located at the address specified
	   by ADDR from the address space of the calling process. See shmdt.

       memread( ADDR, VAR, POS, SIZE )
	   Reads SIZE bytes from a memory segment at ADDR starting at position
	   POS.  VAR must be a variable that will hold the data read. Returns
	   true if successful, or false if there is an error. memread() taints
	   the variable.

       memwrite( ADDR, STRING, POS, SIZE )
	   Writes SIZE bytes from STRING to a memory segment at ADDR starting
	   at position POS. If STRING is too long, only SIZE bytes are used;
	   if STRING is too short, nulls are written to fill out SIZE bytes.
	   Returns true if successful, or false if there is an error.
