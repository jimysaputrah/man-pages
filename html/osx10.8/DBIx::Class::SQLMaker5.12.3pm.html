NAME
       DBIx::Class::SQLMaker - An SQL::Abstract-based SQL maker class

DESCRIPTION
       This module is a subclass of SQL::Abstract and includes a number of
       DBIC-specific workarounds, not yet suitable for inclusion into the
       SQL::Abstract core. It also provides all (and more than) the
       functionality of SQL::Abstract::Limit, see
       DBIx::Class::SQLMaker::LimitDialects for more info.

       Currently the enhancements to SQL::Abstract are:

       o   Support for "JOIN" statements (via extended "table/from" support)

       o   Support of functions in "SELECT" lists

       o   "GROUP BY"/"HAVING" support (via extensions to the order_by
	   parameter)

       o   Support of "...FOR UPDATE" type of select statement modifiers

       o   The "-ident" operator

       o   The "-value" operator

OPERATORS
   -ident
       Used to explicitly specify an SQL identifier. Takes a plain string as
       value which is then invariably treated as a column name (and is being
       properly quoted if quoting has been requested). Most useful for
       comparison of two columns:

	   my %where = (
	       priority =&gt { '&lt', 2 },
	       requestor =&gt { -ident =&gt 'submitter' }
	   );

       which results in:

	   $stmt = 'WHERE "priority" &lt ? AND "requestor" = "submitter"';
	   @bind = ('2');

   -value
       The -value operator signals that the argument to the right is a raw
       bind value.  It will be passed straight to DBI, without invoking any of
       the SQL::Abstract condition-parsing logic. This allows you to, for
       example, pass an array as a column value for databases that support
       array datatypes, e.g.:

	   my %where = (
	       array =&gt { -value =&gt [1, 2, 3] }
	   );

       which results in:

	   $stmt = 'WHERE array = ?';
	   @bind = ([1, 2, 3]);
