NAME
       Authen::SASL - SASL Authentication framework

SYNOPSIS
	use Authen::SASL;

	$sasl = Authen::SASL-&gtnew(
	  mechanism =&gt 'CRAM-MD5 PLAIN ANONYMOUS',
	  callback =&gt {
	    pass =&gt \&fetch_password,
	    user =&gt $user,
	  }
	);

DESCRIPTION
       SASL is a generic mechanism for authentication used by several network
       protocols. Authen::SASL provides an implementation framework that all
       protocols should be able to share.

       The framework allows different implementations of the connection class
       to be plugged in. At the time of writing there were two such plugins.

       Authen::SASL::Perl
	   This module implements several mechanisms and is implemented
	   entirely in Perl.

       Authen::SASL::XS
	   This module uses the Cyrus SASL C-library (both version 1 and 2 are
	   supported).

       Authen::SASL::Cyrus
	   This module is the predecessor to Authen::SASL::XS. It is
	   reccomended to use Authen::SASL::XS

       By default the order in which these plugins are selected is
       Authen::SASL::XS, Authen::SASL::Cyrus and then Authen::SASL::Perl.

       If you want to change it or want to specifically use one implementation
       only simply do

	use Authen::SASL qw(Perl);

       or if you have another plugin module that supports the Authen::SASL API

	use Authen::SASL qw(My::SASL::Plugin);

   CONTRUCTOR
       new ( OPTIONS )
	   The contructor may be called with or without arguments. Passing
	   arguments is just a short cut to calling the "mechanism" and
	   "callback" methods.

	   callback =&gt { NAME =&gt VALUE, NAME =&gt VALUE, ... }
	       Set the callbacks.  See the callback method for details.

	   mechanism =&gt NAMES
	   mech =&gt NAMES
	       Set the list of mechanisms to choose from.  See the mechanism
	       method for details.

	   debug =&gt VALUE
	       Set the debug level bit-value to "VALUE"

	       Debug output will be sent to "STDERR". The bits of this value
	       are:

		1   Show debug messages in the Perl modules for the mechanisms.
		    (Currently only used in GSSAPI)
		4   With security layers in place show information on packages read.
		8   With security layers in place show information on packages written.

	       The default value is 0.

   METHODS
       mechanism ( )
	   Returns the current list of mechanisms

       mechanism ( NAMES )
	   Set the list of mechanisms to choose from. "NAMES" should be a
	   space separated string of the names.

       callback ( NAME )
	   Returns the current callback associated with "NAME".

       callback ( NAME =&gt VALUE, NAME =&gt VALUE, ... )
	   Sets the given callbacks to the given values

       client_new ( SERVICE, HOST, SECURITY )
	   Creates and returns a new connection object for a client-side
	   connection.

       server_new ( SERVICE, HOST, OPTIONS )
	   Creates and returns a new connection object for a server-side
	   connection.

       error ( )
	   Returns any error from the last connection

The Connection Class
       server_start ( CHALLENGE )
	   server_start begins the authentication using the chosen mechanism.
	   If the mechanism is not supported by the installed SASL it fails.
	   Because for some mechanisms the client has to start the
	   negotiation, you can give the client challenge as a parameter.

       server_step ( CHALLENGE )
	   server_step performs the next step in the negotiation process. The
	   first parameter you give is the clients challenge/response.

       client_start ( )
	   The initial step to be performed. Returns the initial value to pass
	   to the server or an empty list on error.

       client_step ( CHALLENGE )
	   This method is called when a response from the server requires it.
	   CHALLENGE is the value from the server. Returns the next value to
	   pass to the server or an empty list on error.

       need_step ( )
	   Returns true if the selected mechanism requires another step before
	   completion (error or success).

       answer ( NAME )
	   The method will return the value returned from the last call to the
	   callback NAME

       property ( NAME )
	   Returns the property value associated with "NAME".

       property ( NAME =&gt VALUE, NAME =&gt VALUE, ... )
	   Sets the named properties to their associated values.

       service ( )
	   Returns the service argument that was passed to *_new-methods.

       host ( )
	   Returns the host argument that was passed to *_new-methods.

       mechanism ( )
	   Returns the name of the chosen mechanism.

       is_success ( )
	   Once need_step() returns false, then you can check if the
	   authentication succeeded by calling this method which returns a
	   boolean value.

   Callbacks
       There are three different ways in which a callback may be passed

       CODEREF
	   If the value passed is a code reference then, when needed, it will
	   be called and the connection object will be passed as the first
	   argument. In addition some callbacks may be passed additional
	   arguments.

       ARRAYREF
	   If the value passed is an array reference, the first element in the
	   array must be a code reference. When the callback is called the
	   code reference will be called with the connection object passed as
	   the first argument and all other values from the array passed
	   after.

       SCALAR
	   All other values passed will be used directly. ie it is the same as
	   passing an code reference that, when called, returns the value.
