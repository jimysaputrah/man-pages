NAME
       Moose::Manual::Support - Policies regarding support, releases, and
       compatibility.

RELEASE SCHEDULE
       Moose uses the release early, release often philosophy. Moose is not
       released on a schedule. Releases happen as new features and bug fixes
       are required.

       There have been to date, 98 releases of Moose over just under four
       years. This is an average of a release every two weeks.

DEPRECATION POLICY
       Moose has always prioritized correctness over performance and backwards
       compatibility.

       Major deprecations or API changes are first documented in the Changes
       file as well as in Moose::Manual::Delta

       Moose then attempts to warn for deprecated features and API changes for
       a reasonable number of releases before breaking any tested API.

       Moose will also warn during installation if the version being installed
       will break a known installed dependency. Unfortunately due to the
       nature of the Perl install process these warnings may be easy to miss.

BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY
       We try to ensure compatibility by having a extensive test suite (last
       count just over around 5123 tests), as well as testing a number of
       packages (currently just under 100 packages) that depend on Moose
       before any release.

       The current list of downstream dependencies that are tested is in
       "xt/author/test-my-dependents.t".

VERSION NUMBERS
       Moose's version numbers are monotonically incrementing two decimal
       values. The version numbers in Moose are not semantic. This means that
       version 1.00 will be the hundredth release, nothing more.

       Occasionally, we will release a test release with a version like
       0.90_03. These versions may be less stable than non-test releases, and
       exist so that developers can test potentially code-breaking changes. By
       default, the CPAN client will not install a distribution which has an
       underscore in its version.

       Moose was declared production ready at version 0.18 (via
       &lthttp://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=608144&gt).

CONTRIBUTING
       Moose has an open contribution policy. Anybody is welcome to submit a
       patch. Please see Moose::Manual::Contributing for more details.
