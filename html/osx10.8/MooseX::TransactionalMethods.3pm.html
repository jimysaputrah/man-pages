NAME
       MooseX::TransactionalMethods - Syntax sugar for transactional methods

SYNOPSIS
	 package Foo::Bar;
	 use MooseX::TransactionalMethods; # includes Moose

	 has schema =&gt (is =&gt 'ro');

	 transactional foo =&gt sub {
	    # this is going to happen inside a transaction
	 };

DESCRIPTION
       This method exports the "transactional" declarator that will enclose
       the method in a txn_do call.

DECLARATOR
       transactional $name =&gt $code
	   When you declare with only the name and the coderef, the wrapper
	   will call 'schema' on your class to fetch the schema object on
	   which it will call txn_do to enclose your coderef.

       transactional $name =&gt $schema, $code
	   When you declare sending the schema object, it will store it in the
	   method metaclass and use it directly without any calls to this
	   object.

	   NOTE THAT MIXING DECLARTIONS WITH SCHEMA AND WITHOUT SCHEMA WILL
	   LEAD TO PAINFULL CONFUSION SINCE THE WRAPPING IS SPECIFIC TO THAT
	   CLASS AND THE BEHAVIOR IS NOT MODIFIED WHEN YOU OVERRIDE THE
	   METHOD. PREFER USING THE DYNAMIC DECLARATOR WHEN POSSIBLE.
