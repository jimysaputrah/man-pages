NAME
       SSL_accept - wait for a TLS/SSL client to initiate a TLS/SSL handshake

SYNOPSIS
	#include &ltopenssl/ssl.h&gt

	int SSL_accept(SSL *ssl);

DESCRIPTION
       SSL_accept() waits for a TLS/SSL client to initiate the TLS/SSL
       handshake.  The communication channel must already have been set and
       assigned to the ssl by setting an underlying BIO.

NOTES
       The behaviour of SSL_accept() depends on the underlying BIO.

       If the underlying BIO is blocking, SSL_accept() will only return once
       the handshake has been finished or an error occurred, except for SGC
       (Server Gated Cryptography). For SGC, SSL_accept() may return with -1,
       but SSL_get_error() will yield SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ/WRITE and
       SSL_accept() should be called again.

       If the underlying BIO is non-blocking, SSL_accept() will also return
       when the underlying BIO could not satisfy the needs of SSL_accept() to
       continue the handshake, indicating the problem by the return value -1.
       In this case a call to SSL_get_error() with the return value of
       SSL_accept() will yield SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ or SSL_ERROR_WANT_WRITE.
       The calling process then must repeat the call after taking appropriate
       action to satisfy the needs of SSL_accept().  The action depends on the
       underlying BIO. When using a non-blocking socket, nothing is to be
       done, but select() can be used to check for the required condition.
       When using a buffering BIO, like a BIO pair, data must be written into
       or retrieved out of the BIO before being able to continue.

RETURN VALUES
       The following return values can occur:

       1.  The TLS/SSL handshake was successfully completed, a TLS/SSL
	   connection has been established.

       2.  The TLS/SSL handshake was not successful but was shut down
	   controlled and by the specifications of the TLS/SSL protocol. Call
	   SSL_get_error() with the return value ret to find out the reason.

       3.  &lt0

	   The TLS/SSL handshake was not successful because a fatal error
	   occurred either at the protocol level or a connection failure
	   occurred. The shutdown was not clean. It can also occur of action
	   is need to continue the operation for non-blocking BIOs. Call
	   SSL_get_error() with the return value ret to find out the reason.

POD ERRORS
       Hey! The above document had some coding errors, which are explained
       below:

       Around line 52:
	   You have '=item 0' instead of the expected '=item 2'

       Around line 58:
	   Expected '=item 3'
