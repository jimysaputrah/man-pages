FECLEAREXCEPT(3)	 BSD Library Functions Manual	      FECLEAREXCEPT(3)

NAME
     feclearexcept, fegetexceptflag, feraiseexcept, fesetexceptflag,
     fetestexcept -- functions providing access to the floating-point status
     flags.

SYNOPSIS
     #include <fenv.h>
     #pragma STDC FENV_ACCESS ON

     int
     feclearexcept(int excepts);

     int
     feraiseexcept(int excepts);

     int
     fetestexcept(int excepts);

     int
     fegetexceptflag(fexcept_t *flagp, int excepts);

     int
     fesetexceptflag(fexcept_t *flagp, int excepts);

DESCRIPTION
     These functions provide access to the floating-point status flags.  The
     int input argument excepts for the functions represents a subset of
     floating-point exceptions, and can be either zero or the bitwise OR of
     one or more floating-point exception macros defined in <fenv.h>, for
     example FE_OVERFLOW | FE_INEXACT.	For other argument values the behavior
     of these functions is undefined.

     The feclearexcept() function attempts to clear the supported floating-
     point flags corresponding to the exceptions specified by its argument.
     It returns zero if excepts is zero or if the flags corresponding to all
     specified exceptions were successfully cleared.  Otherwise, it returns a
     nonzero value.

     The feraiseexcept() function attempts to raise the supported floating-
     point exceptions specified by its argument.  Its effect is similar to
     that of arithmetic operations raising the same exceptions; if traps are
     enabled for the exceptions that are raised, they will be taken.  The
     order in which these exceptions are raised is unspecified.  On OS X and
     iOS, raising overflow or underflow using this function will additionally
     raise the inexact exception.

     The feraiseexcept() function returns zero if excepts is zero or if the
     specified exceptions were successfully raised.  Otherwise a nonzero value
     is returned.

     The fetestexcept() function determines if any of the floating-point flags
     corresponding to the exceptions specified by its argument are currently
     set.  It returns the bitwise OR of the floating-point exception macros
     corresponding to the currently set flags indicated by excepts.  For exam-
     ple, if the underflow and inexact flags are set in the floating-point
     environment, the result of fetestexcept(FE_INEXACT | FE_INVALID) will be
     FE_INEXACT.

     The fegetexceptflag() function attempts to store an implementation-
     defined representation of the states of the floating-point status flags
     corresponding to the exceptions specified by excepts in the object
     pointed to by the argument flagp.	It returns zero if the representation
     is successfully stored, and a nonzero value otherwise.

     The fesetexceptflag() function attempts to set the floating-point status
     flags corresponding to the exceptions specified by excepts to the states
     stored in the object pointed to by flagp.	This function does not raise
     floating-point exceptions--it only sets the state of the flags.  The
     value of *flagp shall have been set by a previous call to
     fegetexceptflag() whose second argument represented a superset of the
     exceptions represented by excepts.

     The fesetexceptflag() function returns zero if the excepts argument is
     zero or if all the specified flags were successfully set.	Otherwise it
     returns a nonzero value.
