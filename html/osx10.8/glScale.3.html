NAME
       glScaled,  glScalef  - multiply the current matrix by a general scaling
       matrix


C SPECIFICATION
       void glScaled( GLdouble x,
		      GLdouble y,
		      GLdouble z )
       void glScalef( GLfloat x,
		      GLfloat y,
		      GLfloat z )


PARAMETERS
       x, y, z
	      Specify scale factors along the x, y, and z axes,  respectively.

DESCRIPTION
       glScale	produces a nonuniform scaling along the x, y, and z axes.  The
       three parameters indicate the desired scale factor along  each  of  the
       three axes.

       The  current  matrix  (see  glMatrixMode)  is  multiplied by this scale
       matrix, and the product replaces the current matrix as if glScale  were
       called with the following matrix as its argument:



				       x 0 0 0
				       0 y 0 0
				       0 0 z 0
				       0 0 0 1


       If the matrix mode is either GL_MODELVIEW or GL_PROJECTION, all objects
       drawn after glScale is called are scaled.

       Use glPushMatrix and glPopMatrix to save and restore the unscaled coor-
       dinate system.

NOTES
       If  scale  factors other than 1 are applied to the modelview matrix and
       lighting is enabled, lighting  often  appears  wrong.   In  that  case,
       enable  automatic normalization of normals by calling glEnable with the
       argument GL_NORMALIZE.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if glScale is	executed  between  the
       execution of glBegin and the corresponding execution of glEnd.
