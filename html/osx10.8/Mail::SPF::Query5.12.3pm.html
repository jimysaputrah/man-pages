NAME
       Mail::SPF::Query - query Sender Policy Framework for an IP,email,helo

VERSION
       1.999.1

SYNOPSIS
	   my $query = new Mail::SPF::Query (ip => "127.0.0.1", sender=>'foo@example.com', helo=>"somehost.example.com", trusted=>0, guess=>0);
	   my ($result, 	  # pass | fail | softfail | neutral | none | error | unknown [mechanism]
	       $smtp_comment,	  # "please see http://www.openspf.org/why.html?..."  when rejecting, return this string to the SMTP client
	       $header_comment,   # prepend_header("Received-SPF" => "$result ($header_comment)")
	       $spf_record,	  # "v=spf1 ..." original SPF record for the domain
	      ) = $query->result();

	   if	 ($result eq "pass") { "Domain is not forged. Apply RHSBL and content filters." }
	   elsif ($result eq "fail") { "Domain is forged. Reject or save to spambox." }

ABSTRACT
       The SPF protocol relies on sender domains to describe their designated
       outbound mailers in DNS.  Given an email address, Mail::SPF::Query
       determines the legitimacy of an SMTP client IP address.

DESCRIPTION
       There are two ways to use Mail::SPF::Query.  Your choice depends on
       whether the domains your server is an MX for have secondary MXes which
       your server doesn't know about.

       The first and more common style, calling ->result(), is suitable when
       all mail is received directly from the originator's MTA.  If the
       domains you receive do not have secondary MX entries, this is
       appropriate.  This style of use is outlined in the SYNOPSIS above.
       This is the common case.

       The second style is more complex, but works when your server receives
       mail from secondary MXes.  This performs checks as each recipient is
       handled.  If the message is coming from a valid MX secondary for a
       recipient, then the SPF check is not performed, and a "pass" response
       is returned right away.	To do this, call "result2()" and
       "message_result2()" instead of "result()".

       If you do not know what a secondary MX is, you probably don't have one.
       Use the first style.

       You can try out Mail::SPF::Query on the command line with the following
       command:

	   perl -MMail::SPF::Query -le 'print for Mail::SPF::Query->new(
	       helo => shift, ipv4 => shift, sender => shift)->result' \
	       helohost.example.com 1.2.3.4 user@example.com

BUGS
       Mail::SPF::Query tries to implement the SPF specification (see "SEE
       ALSO") as close as reasonably possible given that M:S:Q has been the
       very first SPF implementation and has changed with the SPF
       specification over time.  As a result, M:S:Q has various known
       deficiencies that cannot be corrected with reasonably little effort:

       o   Unable to query HELO and MAIL FROM separately.  M:S:Q is not
	   designed to support the separate querying of the HELO and MAIL FROM
	   identities.	Passing the HELO identity as the "sender" argument for
	   a stand-alone HELO check might generally work but could yield
	   unexpected results.

       o   No IPv6 support.  IPv6 is not supported.  "ip6" mechanisms in SPF
	   records and everywhere else are simply ignored.

       o   Result explanation may be inappropriate for local policy results.
	   If a query result was caused by anything other than a real SPF
	   record (i.e. local policy, overrides, fallbacks, etc.), and no
	   custom "default_explanation" was specified, the domain's
	   explanation or M:S:Q's hard-coded default explanation will still be
	   returned.  Be aware that in this case the explanation may not
	   correctly explain the reason for such an artificial result.

NON-STANDARD FEATURES
       Also due to its long history, M:S:Q does have some legacy features that
       are not parts of the official SPF specification, most notably best
       guess processing and trusted forwarder accreditation checking.  Please
       be careful when using these non-standard features or when reproducing
       them in your own SPF implementation, as they may cause unexpected
       results.

METHODS
   "Mail::SPF::Query->new()"
	   my $query = eval { new Mail::SPF::Query (
	       ip	   => '127.0.0.1',
	       sender	   => 'foo@example.com',
	       helo	   => 'host.example.com',

	       # Optional parameters:
	       debug	   => 1, debuglog => sub { print STDERR "@_\n" },
	       local	   => 'extra mechanisms',
	       trusted	   => 1,		   # do trusted forwarder processing
	       guess	   => 1,		   # do best guess if no SPF record
	       default_explanation => 'Please see http://spf.my.isp/spferror.html for details',
	       max_lookup_count    => 10,	   # total number of SPF includes/redirects
	       sanitize    => 0,		   # do not sanitize all returned strings
	       myhostname  => 'foo.example.com',   # prepended to header_comment
	       override    => {   'example.net' => 'v=spf1 a mx -all',
				'*.example.net' => 'v=spf1 a mx -all' },
	       fallback    => {   'example.org' => 'v=spf1 a mx -all',
				'*.example.org' => 'v=spf1 a mx -all' }
	   ) };

	   if ($@) { warn "bad input to Mail::SPF::Query: $@" }

       Set "trusted=>1" to turned on "trusted-forwarder.org" accreditation
       checking.  The mechanism "include:spf.trusted-forwarder.org" is used
       just before a "-all" or "?all".	The precise circumstances are somewhat
       more complicated, but it does get the case of "v=spf1 -all" right --
       i.e.  "trusted-forwarder.org" is not checked.  This is a non-standard
       feature.

       Set "guess=>1" to turned on automatic best guess processing.  This will
       use the best_guess SPF record when one cannot be found in the DNS.
       Note that this can only return "pass" or "neutral".  The "trusted" and
       "local" flags also operate when the best_guess is being used.  This is
       a non-standard feature.

       Set "local=>'include:local.domain'" to include some extra processing
       just before a "-all" or "?all".	The local processing happens just
       before the trusted forwarder processing.  This is a non-standard
       feature.

       Set "default_explanation" to a string to be used if the SPF record does
       not provide a specific explanation. The default value will direct the
       user to a page at www.openspf.org with the following message:

	   Please see http://www.openspf.org/why.html?sender=%{S}&ip=%{I}&receiver=%{R}

       Note that the string has macro substitution performed.

       Set "sanitize" to 0 to get all the returned strings unsanitized.
       Alternatively, pass a function reference and this function will be used
       to sanitize the returned values.  The function must take a single
       string argument and return a single string which contains the sanitized
       result.

       Set "debug=>1" to watch the queries happen.

       Set "override" to define SPF records for domains that do publish but
       which you want to override anyway.  Wildcards are supported.  This is a
       non-standard feature.

       Set "fallback" to define "pretend" SPF records for domains that don't
       publish them yet.  Wildcards are supported.  This is a non-standard
       feature.

       Note: domain name arguments to override and fallback need to be in all
       lowercase.

   "$query->result()"
	   my ($result, $smtp_comment, $header_comment, $spf_record, $detail) = $query->result();

       $result will be one of "pass", "fail", "softfail", "neutral", "none",
       "error" or "unknown [...]":

       "pass"
	   The client IP address is an authorized mailer for the sender.  The
	   mail should be accepted subject to local policy regarding the
	   sender.

       "fail"
	   The client IP address is not an authorized mailer, and the sender
	   wants you to reject the transaction for fear of forgery.

       "softfail"
	   The client IP address is not an authorized mailer, but the sender
	   prefers that you accept the transaction because it isn't absolutely
	   sure all its users are mailing through approved servers.  The
	   "softfail" status is often used during initial deployment of SPF
	   records by a domain.

       "neutral"
	   The sender makes no assertion about the status of the client IP.

       "none"
	   There is no SPF record for this domain.

       "error"
	   The DNS lookup encountered a temporary error during processing.

       "unknown [...]"
	   The domain has a configuration error in the published data or
	   defines a mechanism that this library does not understand.  If the
	   data contained an unrecognized mechanism, it will be presented
	   following "unknown".  You should test for unknown using a regexp
	   "/^unknown/" rather than "eq "unknown"".

       Results are cached internally for a default of 120 seconds.  You can
       call "->result()" repeatedly; subsequent lookups won't hit your DNS.

       "smtp_comment" should be displayed to the SMTP client.

       "header_comment" goes into a "Received-SPF" header, like so:

	   Received-SPF: $result ($header_comment)

       "spf_record" shows the original SPF record fetched for the query.  If
       there is no SPF record, it is blank.  Otherwise, it will start with
       "v=spf1" and contain the SPF mechanisms and such that describe the
       domain.

       Note that the strings returned by this method (and most of the other
       methods) are (at least partially) under the control of the sender's
       domain.	This means that, if the sender is an attacker, the contents
       can be assumed to be hostile.  The various methods that return these
       strings make sure that (by default) the strings returned contain only
       characters in the range 32 - 126.  This behavior can be changed by
       setting "sanitize" to 0 to turn off sanitization entirely.  You can
       also set "sanitize" to a function reference to perform custom
       sanitization.  In particular, assume that "smtp_comment" might contain
       a newline character.

       "detail" is a hash of all the foregoing result elements, plus extra
       data returned by the SPF result.

       Why the weird duplication?  In the beginning, "result()" returned only
       one value, the $result.	Then $smtp_comment and $header_comment came
       along.  Then $spf_record.  Past a certain number of positional results,
       it makes more sense to have a hash.  But we didn't want to break
       backwards compatibility, so we just declared that the fifth result
       would be a hash and future return value would go in there.

       The keys of the hash are:

	   result
	   smtp_comment
	   header_comment
	   header_pairs
	   spf_record
	   modifiers

   "$query->result2()"
	   my ($result, $smtp_comment, $header_comment, $spf_record) = $query->result2('recipient@domain', 'recipient2@domain');

       "result2()" does everything that "result()" does, but it first checks
       to see if the sending system is a recognized MX secondary for the
       recipient(s).  If so, then it returns "pass" and does not perform the
       SPF query.  Note that the sending system may be a MX secondary for some
       (but not all) of the recipients for a multi-recipient message, which is
       why result2 takes an argument list.  See also "message_result2()".

       This is a non-standard feature.	This feature is also deprecated,
       because exemption of trusted relays, such as secondary MXes, should
       really be performed by the software that uses this library before doing
       an SPF check.

       $result will be one of "pass", "fail", "neutral [...]", or "unknown".
       See "result()" above for meanings.

       If you have secondary MXes and if you are unable to explicitly white-
       list them before SPF tests occur, you can use this method in place of
       "result()", calling it as many times as there are recipients, or just
       providing all the recipients at one time.

       "smtp_comment" can be displayed to the SMTP client.

       For example:

	   my $query = new Mail::SPF::Query (ip => "127.0.0.1",
					     sender=>'foo@example.com',
					     helo=>"somehost.example.com");

	   ...

	   my ($result, $smtp_comment, $header_comment);

	   ($result, $smtp_comment, $header_comment) = $query->result2('recip1@example.com');
	   # return suitable error code based on $result eq 'fail' or not

	   ($result, $smtp_comment, $header_comment) = $query->result2('recip2@example.org');
	   # return suitable error code based on $result eq 'fail' or not

	   ($result, $smtp_comment, $header_comment) = $query->message_result2();
	   # return suitable error if $result eq 'fail'
	   # prefix message with "Received-SPF: $result ($header_comment)"

   "$query->message_result2()"
	   my ($result, $smtp_comment, $header_comment, $spf_record) = $query->message_result2();

       "message_result2()" returns an overall status for the message after
       zero or more calls to "result2()".  It will always be the last status
       returned by "result2()", or the status returned by "result()" if
       "result2()" was never called.

       $result will be one of "pass", "fail", "neutral [...]", or "error".
       See "result()" above for meanings.

   "$query->best_guess()"
	   my ($result, $smtp_comment, $header_comment) = $query->best_guess();

       When a domain does not publish an SPF record, this library can produce
       an educated guess anyway.

       It pretends the domain defined A, MX, and PTR mechanisms, plus a few
       others.	The default set of directives is

	   a/24 mx/24 ptr

       That default set will return either "pass" or "neutral".

       If you want to experiment with a different default, you can pass it as
       an argument: "$query->best_guess("a mx ptr")"

       This is a non-standard feature.	This method is also deprecated.  You
       should set "guess=>1" on the "new()" method instead.

   "$query->trusted_forwarder()"
	   my ($result, $smtp_comment, $header_comment) = $query->best_guess();

       It is possible that the message is coming through a known-good relay
       like "acm.org" or "pobox.com".  During the transitional period, many
       legitimate services may appear to forge a sender address: for example,
       a news website may have a "send me this article in email" link.

       The "trusted-forwarder.org" domain is a white-list of known-good hosts
       that either forward mail or perform benign envelope sender forgery:

	   include:spf.trusted-forwarder.org

       This will return either "pass" or "neutral".

       This is a non-standard feature.	This method is also deprecated.  You
       should set "trusted=>1" on the "new()" method instead.

   "$query->sanitize('string')"
       This applies the sanitization rules for the particular query object.
       These rules are controlled by the "sanitize" parameter to the c<new()>
       method.

   "strict_sanitize('string')"
       This ensures that all the characters in the returned string are
       printable.  All whitespace is converted into spaces, and all other non-
       printable characters are converted into question marks.	This is
       probably over-aggressive for many applications.

       This function is used by default when the "sanitize" option is passed
       to the "new()" method.

       This function is not a class method.

   "$query->debuglog()"
       Subclasses may override this with their own debug logger.
       "Log::Dispatch" is recommended.

       Alternatively, pass the "new()" constructor a "debuglog => sub { ... }"
       callback, and we'll pass debugging lines to that.

WARNINGS
       Mail::Query::SPF should only be used at the point where messages are
       received from the Internet.  The underlying assumption is that the
       sender of the e-mail is sending the message directly to you or one of
       your secondary MXes.  If your MTA does not have an exhaustive list of
       secondary MXes, then the "result2()" and "message_result2()" methods
       can be used.  These methods take care to permit mail from secondary
       MXes.
