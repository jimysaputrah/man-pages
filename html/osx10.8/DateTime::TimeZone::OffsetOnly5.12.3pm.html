DateTime::TimeZone::OfUserOContributed Perl DDateTime::TimeZone::OffsetOnly(3)



NAME
       DateTime::TimeZone::OffsetOnly - A DateTime::TimeZone object that just
       contains an offset

VERSION
       version 1.41

SYNOPSIS
	 my $offset_tz = DateTime::TimeZone-&gtnew( name =&gt '-0300' );

DESCRIPTION
       This class is used to provide the DateTime::TimeZone API needed by
       DateTime.pm, but with a fixed offset.  An object in this class always
       returns the same offset as was given in its constructor, regardless of
       the date.

USAGE
       This class has the same methods as a real time zone object, but the
       "category()" method returns undef.

   DateTime::TimeZone::OffsetOnly-&gtnew ( offset =&gt $offset )
       The value given to the offset parameter must be a string such as
       "+0300".  Strings will be converted into numbers by the
       "DateTime::TimeZone::offset_as_seconds()" function.

   $tz-&gtoffset_for_datetime( $datetime )
       No matter what date is given, the offset provided to the constructor is
       always used.

   $tz-&gtname()
   $tz-&gtshort_name_for_datetime()
       Both of these methods return the offset in string form.
