NAME
       File::CheckTree - run many filetest checks on a tree

SYNOPSIS
	   use File::CheckTree;

	   $num_warnings = validate( q{
	       /vmunix		       -e || die
	       /boot		       -e || die
	       /bin		       cd
		   csh		       -ex
		   csh		       !-ug
		   sh		       -ex
		   sh		       !-ug
	       /usr		       -d || warn "What happened to $file?\n"
	   });

DESCRIPTION
       The validate() routine takes a single multiline string consisting of
       directives, each containing a filename plus a file test to try on it.
       (The file test may also be a "cd", causing subsequent relative
       filenames to be interpreted relative to that directory.)  After the
       file test you may put "|| die" to make it a fatal error if the file
       test fails.  The default is "|| warn".  The file test may optionally
       have a "!' prepended to test for the opposite condition.  If you do a
       cd and then list some relative filenames, you may want to indent them
       slightly for readability.  If you supply your own die() or warn()
       message, you can use $file to interpolate the filename.

       Filetests may be bunched:  "-rwx" tests for all of "-r", "-w", and
       "-x".  Only the first failed test of the bunch will produce a warning.

       The routine returns the number of warnings issued.

AUTHOR
       File::CheckTree was derived from lib/validate.pl which was written by
       Larry Wall.  Revised by Paul Grassie &ltgrassie@perl.com&gt in 2002.

HISTORY
       File::CheckTree used to not display fatal error messages.  It used to
       count only those warnings produced by a generic "|| warn" (and not
       those in which the user supplied the message).  In addition, the
       validate() routine would leave the user program in whatever directory
       was last entered through the use of "cd" directives.  These bugs were
       fixed during the development of perl 5.8.  The first fixed version of
       File::CheckTree was 4.2.
