NAME
       IO::Lines - IO:: interface for reading/writing an array of lines

SYNOPSIS
	   use IO::Lines;

	   ### See IO::ScalarArray for details

DESCRIPTION
       This class implements objects which behave just like FileHandle (or
       IO::Handle) objects, except that you may use them to write to (or read
       from) an array of lines.  They can be tiehandle'd as well.

       This is a subclass of IO::ScalarArray in which the underlying array has
       its data stored in a line-oriented-format: that is, every element ends
       in a "\n", with the possible exception of the final element.  This
       makes "getline()" much more efficient; if you plan to do line-oriented
       reading/printing, you want this class.

       The "print()" method will enforce this rule, so you can print arbitrary
       data to the line-array: it will break the data at newlines
       appropriately.

       See IO::ScalarArray for full usage and warnings.
