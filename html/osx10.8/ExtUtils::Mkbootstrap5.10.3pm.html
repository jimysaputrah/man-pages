NAME
       ExtUtils::Mkbootstrap - make a bootstrap file for use by DynaLoader

SYNOPSIS
       "Mkbootstrap"

DESCRIPTION
       Mkbootstrap typically gets called from an extension Makefile.

       There is no "*.bs" file supplied with the extension. Instead, there may
       be a *_BS file which has code for the special cases, like posix for
       berkeley db on the NeXT.

       This file will get parsed, and produce a maybe empty
       @DynaLoader::dl_resolve_using array for the current architecture.  That
       will be extended by $BSLOADLIBS, which was computed by
       ExtUtils::Liblist::ext(). If this array still is empty, we do nothing,
       else we write a .bs file with an @DynaLoader::dl_resolve_using array.

       The *_BS file can put some code into the generated "*.bs" file by
       placing it in $bscode. This is a handy 'escape' mechanism that may
       prove useful in complex situations.

       If @DynaLoader::dl_resolve_using contains "-L*" or "-l*" entries then
       Mkbootstrap will automatically add a dl_findfile() call to the
       generated "*.bs" file.
