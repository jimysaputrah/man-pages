SPI_FREETUPTABLE(3)	PostgreSQL 9.1.4 Documentation	   SPI_FREETUPTABLE(3)



NAME
       SPI_freetuptable - free a row set created by SPI_execute or a similar
       function

SYNOPSIS
       void SPI_freetuptable(SPITupleTable * tuptable)

DESCRIPTION
       SPI_freetuptable frees a row set created by a prior SPI command
       execution function, such as SPI_execute. Therefore, this function is
       usually called with the global variable SPI_tupletable as argument.

       This function is useful if a SPI procedure needs to execute multiple
       commands and does not want to keep the results of earlier commands
       around until it ends. Note that any unfreed row sets will be freed
       anyway at SPI_finish.

ARGUMENTS
       SPITupleTable * tuptable
	   pointer to row set to free
