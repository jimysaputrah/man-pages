NAME
       glCopyTexImage1D - copy pixels into a 1D texture image


C SPECIFICATION
       void glCopyTexImage1D( GLenum target,
			      GLint level,
			      GLenum internalformat,
			      GLint x,
			      GLint y,
			      GLsizei width,
			      GLint border )


PARAMETERS
       target	       Specifies the target texture.  Must be GL_TEXTURE_1D.

       level	       Specifies  the  level-of-detail number.	Level 0 is the
		       base image level.  Level n is the nth mipmap  reduction
		       image.

       internalformat  Specifies the internal  of the texture.	Must be one of
		       the following symbolic constants: GL_ALPHA,  GL_ALPHA4,
		       GL_ALPHA8,    GL_ALPHA12,   GL_ALPHA16,	 GL_LUMINANCE,
		       GL_LUMINANCE4,	   GL_LUMINANCE8,      GL_LUMINANCE12,
		       GL_LUMINANCE16,			   GL_LUMINANCE_ALPHA,
		       GL_LUMINANCE4_ALPHA4,		 GL_LUMINANCE6_ALPHA2,
		       GL_LUMINANCE8_ALPHA8,		GL_LUMINANCE12_ALPHA4,
		       GL_LUMINANCE12_ALPHA12,	       GL_LUMINANCE16_ALPHA16,
		       GL_INTENSITY,	   GL_INTENSITY4,	GL_INTENSITY8,
		       GL_INTENSITY12,	GL_INTENSITY16,  GL_RGB,  GL_R3_G3_B2,
		       GL_RGB4,    GL_RGB5,   GL_RGB8,	 GL_RGB10,   GL_RGB12,
		       GL_RGB16,  GL_RGBA,  GL_RGBA2,  GL_RGBA4,   GL_RGB5_A1,
		       GL_RGBA8, GL_RGB10_A2, GL_RGBA12, or GL_RGBA16.

       x, y	       Specify	the  window  coordinates of the left corner of
		       the row of pixels to be copied.

       width	       Specifies the width of the texture image.  Must be 0 or
		       (2^n) + 2*border for some integer n.  The height of the
		       texture image is 1.

       border	       Specifies the width of the border.  Must be either 0 or
		       1.

DESCRIPTION
       glCopyTexImage1D  defines  a  one-dimensional texture image with pixels
       from the current GL_READ_BUFFER.

       The screen-aligned pixel row with left corner at  (x,  y)  and  with  a
       length  of width+2*border defines the texture array at the mipmap level
       specified by level.  internalformat specifies the internal  of the tex-
       ture array.

       The pixels in the row are processed exactly as if glCopyPixels had been
       called, but the process stops just before final	conversion.   At  this
       point  all  pixel  component values are clamped to the range [0, 1] and
       then converted to the texture's internal   for  storage	in  the  texel
       array.

       Pixel  ordering	is  such that lower x screen coordinates correspond to
       lower texture coordinates.

       If  any	of  the  pixels  within  the  specified  row  of  the  current
       GL_READ_BUFFER  are outside the window associated with the current ren-
       dering context, then the values obtained for  those  pixels  are  unde-
       fined.

NOTES
       glCopyTexImage1D is available only if the GL version is 1.1 or greater.

       Texturing has no effect in color index mode.

       1, 2, 3, and 4 are not accepted values for internalformat.

       An image with 0 width indicates a NULL texture.

       When the GL_ARB_imaging extension is  supported,  the  RGBA  components
       copied  from  the framebuffer may be processed by the imaging pipeline.
       See glTexImage1D for specific details.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if target is not one of the allowable val-
       ues.

       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if level is less than 0.

       GL_INVALID_VALUE  may  be generated if level is greater than log2(max),
       where max is the returned value of GL_MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE.

       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if	internalformat	is  not  an  allowable
       value.

       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if width is less than 0 or greater than 2
       + GL_MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE, or if it cannot be represented as (2^n) + 2*bor-
       der for some integer value of n.

       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if border is not 0 or 1.

       GL_INVALID_OPERATION  is  generated  if	glCopyTexImage1D  is  executed
       between the execution of glBegin and  the  corresponding  execution  of
       glEnd.
