NAME
       MIME::Decoder::QuotedPrint - encode/decode a "quoted-printable" stream

SYNOPSIS
       A generic decoder object; see MIME::Decoder for usage.

DESCRIPTION
       A MIME::Decoder subclass for the "quoted-printable" encoding.  The name
       was chosen to jibe with the pre-existing MIME::QuotedPrint utility
       package, which this class actually uses to translate each line.

       o   The decoder does a line-by-line translation from input to output.

       o   The encoder does a line-by-line translation, breaking lines so that
	   they fall under the standard 76-character limit for this encoding.

       Note: just like MIME::QuotedPrint, we currently use the native "\n" for
       line breaks, and not "CRLF".  This may need to change in future
       versions.
