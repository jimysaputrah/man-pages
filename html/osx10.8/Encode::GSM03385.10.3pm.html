NAME
       Encode::GSM0338 -- ESTI GSM 03.38 Encoding

SYNOPSIS
	 use Encode qw/encode decode/;
	 $gsm0338 = encode("gsm0338", $utf8);	 # loads Encode::GSM0338 implicitly
	 $utf8	  = decode("gsm0338", $gsm0338); # ditto

DESCRIPTION
       GSM0338 is for GSM handsets. Though it shares alphanumerals with ASCII,
       control character ranges and other parts are mapped very differently,
       mainly to store Greek characters.  There are also escape sequences
       (starting with 0x1B) to cover e.g. the Euro sign.

       This was once handled by Encode::Bytes but because of all those unusual
       specifications, Encode 2.20 has relocated the support to this module.

NOTES
       Unlike most other encodings,  the following aways croaks on error for
       any $chk that evaluates to true.

	 $gsm0338 = encode("gsm0338", $utf8	 $chk);
	 $utf8	  = decode("gsm0338", $gsm0338,  $chk);

       So if you want to check the validity of the encoding, surround the
       expression with "eval {}" block as follows;

	 eval {
	   $utf8    = decode("gsm0338", $gsm0338,  $chk);
	 };
	 if ($@){
	   # handle exception here
	 }

BUGS
       ESTI GSM 03.38 Encoding itself.

       Mapping \x00 to '@' causes too much pain everywhere.

       Its use of \x1b (escape) is also very questionable.

       Because of those two, the code paging approach used use in ucm-based
       Encoding SOMETIMES fails so this module was written.
