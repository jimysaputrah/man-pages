NAME
       gluPickMatrix - define a picking region


C SPECIFICATION
       void gluPickMatrix( GLdouble x,
			   GLdouble y,
			   GLdouble delX,
			   GLdouble delY,
			   GLint *viewport )


PARAMETERS
       x, y Specify the center of a picking region in window coordinates.

       delX, delY
	    Specify  the width and height, respectively, of the picking region
	    in window coordinates.

       viewport
	    Specifies the current viewport (as from a glGetIntegerv call).

DESCRIPTION
       gluPickMatrix creates a projection matrix that can be used to  restrict
       drawing to a small region of the viewport.  This is typically useful to
       determine  what	objects  are  being  drawn  near  the	cursor.    Use
       gluPickMatrix  to restrict drawing to a small region around the cursor.
       Then, enter selection mode (with glRenderMode) and rerender the	scene.
       All  primitives	that would have been drawn near the cursor are identi-
       fied and stored in the selection buffer.

       The matrix created by gluPickMatrix is multiplied by the current matrix
       just as if glMultMatrix is called with the generated matrix.  To effec-
       tively use the generated pick matrix for picking, first	call  glLoadI-
       dentity	to  load an identity matrix onto the perspective matrix stack.
       Then  call  gluPickMatrix,  and	finally,  call	a  command  (such   as
       gluPerspective)	to multiply the perspective matrix by the pick matrix.

       When using gluPickMatrix to pick NURBS, be  careful  to	turn  off  the
       NURBS  property	GLU_AUTO_LOAD_MATRIX.	If GLU_AUTO_LOAD_MATRIX is not
       turned off, then any NURBS surface rendered is  subdivided  differently
       with  the  pick	matrix than the way it was subdivided without the pick
       matrix.

EXAMPLE
       When rendering a scene as follows:

	glMatrixMode(GL_PROJECTION);
	glLoadIdentity();
	gluPerspective(...);
	glMatrixMode(GL_MODELVIEW);
	/* Draw the scene */

       a portion of the viewport can be selected as a pick region like this:

	glMatrixMode(GL_PROJECTION);
	glLoadIdentity();
	gluPickMatrix(x, y, width, height, viewport);
	gluPerspective(...);
	glMatrixMode(GL_MODELVIEW);
	/* Draw the scene */
