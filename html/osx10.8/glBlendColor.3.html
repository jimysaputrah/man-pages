NAME
       glBlendColor - set the blend color


C SPECIFICATION
       void glBlendColor( GLclampf red,
			  GLclampf green,
			  GLclampf blue,
			  GLclampf alpha )


PARAMETERS
       red, green, blue, alpha
			     specify the components of GL_BLEND_COLOR

DESCRIPTION
       The  GL_BLEND_COLOR may be used to calculate the source and destination
       blending factors. The color components are clamped to the range	[0, 1]
       before  being stored. See glBlendFunc for a complete description of the
       blending operations.  Initially the GL_BLEND_COLOR is set to (0, 0,  0,
       0).

NOTES
       glBlendColor  is  part  of  the	GL_ARB_imaging subset. glBlendColor is
       present only if GL_ARB_imaging is returned when glGetString  is	called
       with GL_EXTENSIONS as its argument.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_OPERATION  is  generated if glBlendColor is executed between
       the execution of glBegin and the corresponding execution of glEnd.


ASSOCIATED GETS
       glGet with an argument of GL_BLEND_COLOR
