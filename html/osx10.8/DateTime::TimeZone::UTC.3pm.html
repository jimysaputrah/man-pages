NAME
       DateTime::TimeZone::UTC - The UTC time zone

VERSION
       version 1.41

SYNOPSIS
	 my $utc_tz = DateTime::TimeZone::UTC-&gtnew;

DESCRIPTION
       This class is used to provide the DateTime::TimeZone API needed by
       DateTime.pm for the UTC time zone, which is not explicitly included in
       the Olson time zone database.

       The offset for this object will always be zero.

USAGE
       This class has the same methods as a real time zone object, but the
       "category()" method returns undef and "is_utc()" returns true.
