NAME
       TAP::Parser::Result::Plan - Plan result token.

VERSION
       Version 3.17

DESCRIPTION
       This is a subclass of TAP::Parser::Result.  A token of this class will
       be returned if a plan line is encountered.

	1..1
	ok 1 - woo hooo!

       1..1 is the plan.  Gotta have a plan.

OVERRIDDEN METHODS
       Mainly listed here to shut up the pitiful screams of the pod coverage
       tests.  They keep me awake at night.

       o   "as_string"

       o   "raw"

   Instance Methods
       "plan"

	 if ( $result->is_plan ) {
	    print $result->plan;
	 }

       This is merely a synonym for "as_string".

       "tests_planned"

	 my $planned = $result->tests_planned;

       Returns the number of tests planned.  For example, a plan of 1..17 will
       cause this method to return '17'.

       "directive"

	my $directive = $plan->directive;

       If a SKIP directive is included with the plan, this method will return
       it.

	1..0 # SKIP: why bother?

       "has_skip"

	 if ( $result->has_skip ) { ... }

       Returns a boolean value indicating whether or not this test has a SKIP
       directive.

       "explanation"

	my $explanation = $plan->explanation;

       If a SKIP directive was included with the plan, this method will return
       the explanation, if any.

       "todo_list"

	 my $todo = $result->todo_list;
	 for ( @$todo ) {
	     ...
	 }
