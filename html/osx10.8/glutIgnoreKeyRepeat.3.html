NAME
       glutIgnoreKeyRepeat - determines if auto repeat keystrokes are reported
       to the current window

SYNTAX
       #include <GLUT/glut.h>

       void glutIgnoreKeyRepeat(int ignore);

ARGUMENTS
       ignore	 Non-zero indicates  auto  repeat  keystrokes  should  not  be
		 reported  by  the  keyboard and special callbacks; zero indi-
		 cates that auto repeat keystrokes will be reported.

DESCRIPTION
       glutIgnoreKeyRepeat determines if auto repeat keystrokes  are  reported
       to the current window.  The ignore auto repeat state of a window can be
       queried with glutDeviceGet(GLUT_DEVICE_IGNORE_KEY_REPEAT).

       Ignoring auto repeated keystrokes is generally done in conjunction with
       using  the glutKeyboardUpFunc and glutSpecialUpFunc callbacks to repeat
       key releases.  If you do not ignore auto repeated keystrokes, your GLUT
       application  will  experience  repeated release/press callbacks.  Games
       using the keyboard will typically want to ignore key repeat.

GLUT IMPLEMENTATION NOTES FOR X11
       X11 sends KeyPress events repeatedly when the  window  system's	global
       auto  repeat  is  enabled.   glutIgnoreKeyRepeat can prevent these auto
       repeated keystrokes from being reported as keyboard  or	special  call-
       backs, but there is still some minimal overhead by the X server to con-
       tinually stream KeyPress events to the  GLUT  application.   The  glut-
       SetKeyRepeat routine can be used to actually disable the global sending
       of auto repeated KeyPress events.  Note that  glutSetKeyRepeat  affects
       the  global  window system auto repeat state so other applications will
       not auto repeat if you  disable	auto  repeat  globally	through  glut-
       SetKeyRepeat.
