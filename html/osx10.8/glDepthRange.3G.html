NAME
       glDepthRange - specify mapping of depth values from normalized device
       coordinates to window coordinates

C SPECIFICATION
       void glDepthRange(GLclampd nearVal, GLclampd farVal);

PARAMETERS
       nearVal
	   Specifies the mapping of the near clipping plane to window
	   coordinates. The initial value is 0.

       farVal
	   Specifies the mapping of the far clipping plane to window
	   coordinates. The initial value is 1.

DESCRIPTION
       After clipping and division by w, depth coordinates range from -1 to 1,
       corresponding to the near and far clipping planes.  glDepthRange
       specifies a linear mapping of the normalized depth coordinates in this
       range to window depth coordinates. Regardless of the actual depth
       buffer implementation, window coordinate depth values are treated as
       though they range from 0 through 1 (like color components). Thus, the
       values accepted by glDepthRange are both clamped to this range before
       they are accepted.

       The setting of (0,1) maps the near plane to 0 and the far plane to 1.
       With this mapping, the depth buffer range is fully utilized.

NOTES
       It is not necessary that nearVal be less than farVal. Reverse mappings
       such as nearVal = 1, and farVal = 0 are acceptable.
