NAME
     pam_mount -- Home Folder Mounting PAM module

SYNOPSIS
     [service-name] function-class control-flag pam_mount [options]

DESCRIPTION
     The Home Folder Mounting PAM module supports the authentication and ses-
     sion management function classes.	In terms of the function-class parame-
     ter, these are ``auth'' and ``session'' respectively.

   The Home Folder Mounting Authentication Module
     The Home Folder Mounting authentication module reads the mount authenti-
     cator from the PAM authentication context and caches it in the PAM envi-
     ronment.  The Home Folder Mounting Session Management Module must be used
     in conjunction with this module to remove the authenticator from the PAM
     environment.

   The Home Folder Mounting Session Management Module
     The Home Folder Mounting session management module copies the mount
     authenticator from the PAM environment, removes it from the PAM environ-
     ment, and uses its copy to mount the user's home folder if the user's
     OpenDirectory record indicates that an AFP, SMB, NFS or FileVault home
     folder is to be used.

     When the session is closed, the Home Folder Mounting session management
     module unmounts the user's home folder if it was mounted by this module
     when the session was opened.
