NAME
       Net::CIDR::Lite - Perl extension for merging IPv4 or IPv6 CIDR
       addresses

SYNOPSIS
	 use Net::CIDR::Lite;

	 my $cidr = Net::CIDR::Lite-&gtnew;
	 $cidr-&gtadd($cidr_address);
	 @cidr_list = $cidr-&gtlist;
	 @ip_ranges = $cidr-&gtlist_range;

DESCRIPTION
       Faster alternative to Net::CIDR when merging a large number of CIDR
       address ranges. Works for IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.

METHODS
       new()
	    $cidr = Net::CIDR::Lite-&gtnew
	    $cidr = Net::CIDR::Lite-&gtnew(@args)

	   Creates an object to represent a list of CIDR address ranges.  No
	   particular format is set yet; once an add method is called with a
	   IPv4 or IPv6 format, only that format may be added for this cidr
	   object. Any arguments supplied are passed to add_any() (see below).

       add()
	    $cidr-&gtadd($cidr_address)

	   Adds a CIDR address range to the list.

       add_range()
	    $cidr-&gtadd_range($ip_range)

	   Adds a hyphenated IP address range to the list.

       add_cidr()
	    $cidr1-&gtadd_cidr($cidr2)

	   Adds address ranges from one object to another object.

       add_ip()
	    $cidr-&gtadd_ip($ip_address)

	   Adds a single IP address to the list.

       add_any()
	    $cidr-&gtadd_any($cidr_or_range_or_address);

	   Determines format of range or single ip address and calls add(),
	   add_range(), add_cidr(), or add_ip() as appropriate.

       $cidr-&gtclean()
	    $cidr-&gtclean;

	   If you are going to call the list method more than once on the same
	   data, then for optimal performance, you can call this to purge null
	   nodes in overlapping ranges from the list. Boundary nodes in
	   contiguous ranges are automatically purged during add().  Only
	   useful when ranges overlap or when contiguous ranges are added out
	   of order.

       $cidr-&gtlist()
	    @cidr_list = $cidr-&gtlist;
	    $list_ref  = $cidr-&gtlist;

	   Returns a list of the merged CIDR addresses. Returns an array if
	   called in list context, an array reference if not.

       $cidr-&gtlist_range()
	    @cidr_list = $cidr-&gtlist_range;
	    $list_ref  = $cidr-&gtlist_range;

	   Returns a list of the merged addresses, but in hyphenated range
	   format. Returns an array if called in list context, an array
	   reference if not.

       $cidr-&gtlist_short_range()
	    @cidr_list = $cidr-&gtlist_short_range;
	    $list_ref  = $cidr-&gtlist_short_range;

	   Returns a list of the C subnet merged addresses, in short
	   hyphenated range format. Returns an array if called in list
	   context, an array reference if not.

	   Example:

		   1.1.1.1-2
		   1.1.1.5-7
		   1.1.1.254-255
		   1.1.2.0-2
		   1.1.3.5
		   1.1.3.7

       $cidr-&gtfind()
	    $found = $cidr-&gtfind($ip);

	   Returns true if the ip address is found in the CIDR range. False if
	   not.  Not extremely efficient, is O(n*log(n)) to sort the ranges in
	   the cidr object O(n) to search through the ranges in the cidr
	   object.  The sort is cached on the first call and used in
	   subsequent calls, but if more addresses are added to the cidr
	   object, prep_find() must be called on the cidr object.

       $cidr-&gtbin_find()
	   Same as find(), but forces a binary search. See also prep_find.

       $cidr-&gtprep_find()
	    $cidr-&gtprep_find($num);

	   Caches the result of sorting the ip addresses. Implicitly called on
	   the first find call, but must be explicitly called if more
	   addresses are added to the cidr object. find() will do a binary
	   search if the number of ranges is greater than or equal to $num
	   (default 20);

       $cidr-&gtspanner()
	    $spanner = $cidr1-&gtspanner($label1, $cidr2, $label2, ...);

	   Creates a spanner object to find out if multiple ip addresses are
	   within multiple labeled address ranges. May also be called as (with
	   or without any arguments):

	    Net::CIDR::Lite::Span-&gtnew($cidr1, $label1, $cidr2, $label2, ...);

       $spanner-&gtadd()
	    $spanner-&gtadd($cidr1, $label1, $cidr2, $label2,...);

	   Adds labeled address ranges to the spanner object. The 'address
	   range' may be a Net::CIDR::Lite object, a single CIDR address
	   range, a single hyphenated IP address range, or a single IP
	   address.

       $spanner-&gtfind()
	    $href = $spanner-&gtfind(@ip_addresses);

	   Look up which range(s) ip addresses are in, and return a lookup
	   table of the results, with the keys being the ip addresses, and the
	   value a hash reference of which address ranges the ip address is
	   in.

       $spanner-&gtbin_find()
	   Same as find(), but forces a binary search. See also prep_find.

       $spanner-&gtprep_find()
	    $spanner-&gtprep_find($num);

	   Called implicitly the first time $spanner-&gtfind(..) is called, must
	   be called again if more cidr objects are added to the spanner
	   object. Will do a binary search if ratio of the number of ip
	   addresses to the number of ranges is less than $num percent
	   (default 4).

       $spanner-&gtclean()
	    $clean_address = $spanner-&gtclean($ip_address);

	   Validates and returns a cleaned up version of an ip address (which
	   is what you will find as the key in the result from the
	   $spanner-&gtfind(..), not necessarily what the original argument
	   looked like). E.g. removes unnecessary leading zeros, removes null
	   blocks from IPv6 addresses, etc.

CAVEATS
       Garbage in/garbage out. This module does do validation, but maybe not
       enough to suit your needs.
