NAME
       MooseX::Storage::Traits::DisableCycleDetection - A custom trait to
       bypass cycle detection

SYNOPSIS
	   package Double;
	   use Moose;
	   use MooseX::Storage;
	   with Storage( traits => ['DisableCycleDetection'] );

	   has 'x' => ( is => 'rw', isa => 'HashRef' );
	   has 'y' => ( is => 'rw', isa => 'HashRef' );

	   my $ref = {};

	   my $double = Double->new( 'x' => $ref, 'y' => $ref );

	   $double->pack;

DESCRIPTION
       "MooseX::Storage" implements a primitive check for circular references.
       This check also triggers on simple cases as shown in the Synopsis.
       Providing the "DisableCycleDetection" traits disables checks for any
       cyclical references, so if you know what you are doing, you can bypass
       this check.

       This trait is applied to all objects that inherit from it. To use this
       on a per-case basis, see "disable_cycle_check" in
       MooseX::Storage::Basic.

       See the SYNOPSIS for a nice example that can be easily cargo-culted.
