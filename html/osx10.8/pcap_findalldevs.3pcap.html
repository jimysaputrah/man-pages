NAME
       pcap_findalldevs - get a list of capture devices

SYNOPSIS
       #include &ltpcap/pcap.h&gt

       char errbuf[PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE];

       int pcap_findalldevs(pcap_if_t **alldevsp, char *errbuf);

DESCRIPTION
       pcap_findalldevs()  constructs  a  list	of network devices that can be
       opened with pcap_create() and pcap_activate() or with pcap_open_live().
       (Note  that  there  may be network devices that cannot be opened by the
       process calling pcap_findalldevs(), because, for example, that  process
       might not have sufficient privileges to open them for capturing; if so,
       those devices will not appear on the list.)  alldevsp is set  to  point
       to  the	first element of the list; each element of the list is of type
       pcap_if_t, and has the following members:

	      next   if not NULL, a pointer to the next element in  the  list;
		     NULL for the last element of the list

	      name   a	pointer  to  a	string giving a name for the device to
		     pass to pcap_open_live()

	      description
		     if not NULL, a pointer to a string giving	a  human-read-
		     able description of the device

	      addresses
		     a pointer to the first element of a list of addresses for
		     the interface

	      flags  interface flags:

		     PCAP_IF_LOOPBACK
			    set if the interface is a loopback interface

       Each element of the list of addresses is of type pcap_addr_t,  and  has
       the following members:

	      next   if  not  NULL, a pointer to the next element in the list;
		     NULL for the last element of the list

	      addr   a pointer to a struct sockaddr containing an address

	      netmask
		     if not NULL, a pointer to a struct sockaddr that contains
		     the  netmask  corresponding  to the address pointed to by
		     addr

	      broadaddr
		     if not NULL, a pointer to a struct sockaddr that contains
		     the   broadcast  address  corresponding  to  the  address
		     pointed to by addr; may be null if the interface  doesn't
		     support broadcasts

	      dstaddr
		     if not NULL, a pointer to a struct sockaddr that contains
		     the destination  address  corresponding  to  the  address
		     pointed  to by addr; may be null if the interface isn't a
		     point-to-point interface

       Note that not all the addresses in the list of addresses are  necessar-
       ily IPv4 or IPv6 addresses - you must check the sa_family member of the
       struct sockaddr before interpreting the contents of the address.

       The list of devices must be freed with pcap_freealldevs().

RETURN VALUE
       pcap_findalldevs() returns 0 on success and -1 on failure.   If	-1  is
       returned,  errbuf  is  filled  in  with	an  appropriate error message.
       errbuf is assumed to be able to hold at least PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE chars.
