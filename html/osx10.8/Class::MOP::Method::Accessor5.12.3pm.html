NAME
       Class::MOP::Method::Accessor - Method Meta Object for accessors

VERSION
       version 2.0205

SYNOPSIS
	   use Class::MOP::Method::Accessor;

	   my $reader = Class::MOP::Method::Accessor-&gtnew(
	       attribute     =&gt $attribute,
	       is_inline     =&gt 1,
	       accessor_type =&gt 'reader',
	   );

	   $reader-&gtbody-&gtexecute($instance); # call the reader method

DESCRIPTION
       This is a subclass of "Class::MOP::Method" which is used by
       "Class::MOP::Attribute" to generate accessor code. It handles
       generation of readers, writers, predicates and clearers. For each type
       of method, it can either create a subroutine reference, or actually
       inline code by generating a string and "eval"'ing it.

METHODS
       Class::MOP::Method::Accessor-&gtnew(%options)
	   This returns a new "Class::MOP::Method::Accessor" based on the
	   %options provided.

	   o   attribute

	       This is the "Class::MOP::Attribute" for which accessors are
	       being generated. This option is required.

	   o   accessor_type

	       This is a string which should be one of "reader", "writer",
	       "accessor", "predicate", or "clearer". This is the type of
	       method being generated. This option is required.

	   o   is_inline

	       This indicates whether or not the accessor should be inlined.
	       This defaults to false.

	   o   name

	       The method name (without a package name). This is required.

	   o   package_name

	       The package name for the method. This is required.

       $metamethod-&gtaccessor_type
	   Returns the accessor type which was passed to "new".

       $metamethod-&gtis_inline
	   Returns a boolean indicating whether or not the accessor is
	   inlined.

       $metamethod-&gtassociated_attribute
	   This returns the Class::MOP::Attribute object which was passed to
	   "new".

       $metamethod-&gtbody
	   The method itself is generated when the accessor object is
	   constructed.
