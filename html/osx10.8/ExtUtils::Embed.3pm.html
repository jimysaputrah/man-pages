NAME
       ExtUtils::Embed - Utilities for embedding Perl in C/C++ applications

SYNOPSIS
	perl -MExtUtils::Embed -e xsinit
	perl -MExtUtils::Embed -e ccopts
	perl -MExtUtils::Embed -e ldopts

DESCRIPTION
       ExtUtils::Embed provides utility functions for embedding a Perl
       interpreter and extensions in your C/C++ applications.  Typically, an
       application Makefile will invoke ExtUtils::Embed functions while
       building your application.

@EXPORT
       ExtUtils::Embed exports the following functions:

       xsinit(), ldopts(), ccopts(), perl_inc(), ccflags(), ccdlflags(),
       xsi_header(), xsi_protos(), xsi_body()

FUNCTIONS
       xsinit()
	   Generate C/C++ code for the XS initializer function.

	   When invoked as "`perl -MExtUtils::Embed -e xsinit --`" the
	   following options are recognized:

	   -o <output filename> (Defaults to perlxsi.c)

	   -o STDOUT will print to STDOUT.

	   -std (Write code for extensions that are linked with the current
	   Perl.)

	   Any additional arguments are expected to be names of modules to
	   generate code for.

	   When invoked with parameters the following are accepted and
	   optional:

	   "xsinit($filename,$std,[@modules])"

	   Where,

	   $filename is equivalent to the -o option.

	   $std is boolean, equivalent to the -std option.

	   [@modules] is an array ref, same as additional arguments mentioned
	   above.

       Examples
	    perl -MExtUtils::Embed -e xsinit -- -o xsinit.c Socket

	   This will generate code with an xs_init function that glues the
	   perl Socket::bootstrap function to the C boot_Socket function and
	   writes it to a file named xsinit.c.

	   Note that DynaLoader is a special case where it must call
	   boot_DynaLoader directly.

	    perl -MExtUtils::Embed -e xsinit

	   This will generate code for linking with DynaLoader and each static
	   extension found in $Config{static_ext}.  The code is written to the
	   default file name perlxsi.c.

	    perl -MExtUtils::Embed -e xsinit -- -o xsinit.c -std DBI DBD::Oracle

	   Here, code is written for all the currently linked extensions along
	   with code for DBI and DBD::Oracle.

	   If you have a working DynaLoader then there is rarely any need to
	   statically link in any other extensions.

       ldopts()
	   Output arguments for linking the Perl library and extensions to
	   your application.

	   When invoked as "`perl -MExtUtils::Embed -e ldopts --`" the
	   following options are recognized:

	   -std

	   Output arguments for linking the Perl library and any extensions
	   linked with the current Perl.

	   -I <path1:path2>

	   Search path for ModuleName.a archives.  Default path is @INC.
	   Library archives are expected to be found as
	   /some/path/auto/ModuleName/ModuleName.a For example, when looking
	   for Socket.a relative to a search path, we should find
	   auto/Socket/Socket.a

	   When looking for DBD::Oracle relative to a search path, we should
	   find auto/DBD/Oracle/Oracle.a

	   Keep in mind that you can always supply /my/own/path/ModuleName.a
	   as an additional linker argument.

	   --  <list of linker args>

	   Additional linker arguments to be considered.

	   Any additional arguments found before the -- token are expected to
	   be names of modules to generate code for.

	   When invoked with parameters the following are accepted and
	   optional:

	   "ldopts($std,[@modules],[@link_args],$path)"

	   Where:

	   $std is boolean, equivalent to the -std option.

	   [@modules] is equivalent to additional arguments found before the
	   -- token.

	   [@link_args] is equivalent to arguments found after the -- token.

	   $path is equivalent to the -I option.

	   In addition, when ldopts is called with parameters, it will return
	   the argument string rather than print it to STDOUT.

       Examples
	    perl -MExtUtils::Embed -e ldopts

	   This will print arguments for linking with libperl and extensions
	   found in $Config{static_ext}.  This includes libraries found in
	   $Config{libs} and the first ModuleName.a library for each extension
	   that is found by searching @INC or the path specified by the -I
	   option.  In addition, when ModuleName.a is found, additional linker
	   arguments are picked up from the extralibs.ld file in the same
	   directory.

	    perl -MExtUtils::Embed -e ldopts -- -std Socket

	   This will do the same as the above example, along with printing
	   additional arguments for linking with the Socket extension.

	    perl -MExtUtils::Embed -e ldopts -- -std Msql -- -L/usr/msql/lib -lmsql

	   Any arguments after the second '--' token are additional linker
	   arguments that will be examined for potential conflict.  If there
	   is no conflict, the additional arguments will be part of the
	   output.

       perl_inc()
	   For including perl header files this function simply prints:

	    -I$Config{archlibexp}/CORE

	   So, rather than having to say:

	    perl -MConfig -e 'print "-I$Config{archlibexp}/CORE"'

	   Just say:

	    perl -MExtUtils::Embed -e perl_inc

       ccflags(), ccdlflags()
	   These functions simply print $Config{ccflags} and
	   $Config{ccdlflags}

       ccopts()
	   This function combines perl_inc(), ccflags() and ccdlflags() into
	   one.

       xsi_header()
	   This function simply returns a string defining the same EXTERN_C
	   macro as perlmain.c along with #including perl.h and EXTERN.h.

       xsi_protos(@modules)
	   This function returns a string of boot_$ModuleName prototypes for
	   each @modules.

       xsi_body(@modules)
	   This function returns a string of calls to newXS() that glue the
	   module bootstrap function to boot_ModuleName for each @modules.

	   xsinit() uses the xsi_* functions to generate most of its code.
