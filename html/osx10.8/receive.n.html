DESCRIPTION
       This package provides the most primitive commands for receiving charac-
       ters to a terminal. They are in essence convenient wrappers around  the
       builtin commands read and fileevent.

       ::term::receive::getch ?chan?
	      This command reads a single character from the channel with han-
	      dle chan and returns it as the result of the command.

	      If not specified chan defaults to stdin.

	      It is the responsibility of the caller to  make  sure  that  the
	      channel can provide single characters. On unix this can be done,
	      for   example,	by    using    the    command	 of    package
	      term::ansi::ctrl::unix.

       ::term::receive::listen cmd ?chan?
	      This  command  sets  up a filevent listener for the channel with
	      handle chan and invokes the command prefix cmd whenever  charac-
	      ters have been received, or EOF was reached.

	      If not specified chan defaults to stdin.

	      The signature of the command prefix is

	      cmd process string
		     This method is invoked when characters were received, and
		     string holds them for processing.

	      cmd eof
		     This method is invoked when EOF was reached on the  chan-
		     nel  we  listen  on.   It	will  be  the  last call to be
		     received by the callback.

       ::term::receive::unlisten ?chan?
	      This command disables the filevent listener for the channel with
	      handle chan.

	      If not specified chan defaults to stdin.
