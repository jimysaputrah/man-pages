NAME
       glArrayElement  - render a vertex using the specified vertex array ele-
       ment


C SPECIFICATION
       void glArrayElement( GLint i )


PARAMETERS
       i  Specifies an index into the enabled vertex data arrays.

DESCRIPTION
       glArrayElement commands are used within glBegin/glEnd pairs to  specify
       vertex  and  attribute data for point, line, and polygon primitives. If
       GL_VERTEX_ARRAY is enabled when glArrayElement is called, a single ver-
       tex  is drawn, using vertex and attribute data taken from location i of
       the enabled arrays. If  GL_VERTEX_ARRAY	is  not  enabled,  no  drawing
       occurs but the attributes corresponding to the enabled arrays are modi-
       fied.

       Use glArrayElement to construct primitives  by  indexing  vertex  data,
       rather than by streaming through arrays of data in first-to-last order.
       Because each call specifies only a single vertex,  it  is  possible  to
       explicitly specify per-primitive attributes such as a single normal per
       individual triangle.

       Changes made to array data between the execution  of  glBegin  and  the
       corresponding  execution  of  glEnd  may affect calls to glArrayElement
       that are made within the same glBegin/glEnd  period  in	non-sequential
       ways.  That is, a call to
       glArrayElement  that  precedes  a  change  to array data may access the
       changed data, and a call that follows a change to array data may access
       original data.

NOTES
       glArrayElement is available only if the GL version is 1.1 or greater.

       glArrayElement  is  included  in  display  lists.  If glArrayElement is
       entered into a display list, the necessary array  data  (determined  by
       the  array pointers and enables) is also entered into the display list.
       Because the array pointers and enables  are  client-side  state,  their
       values  affect  display	lists when the lists are created, not when the
       lists are executed.
