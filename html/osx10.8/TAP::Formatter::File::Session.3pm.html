NAME
       TAP::Formatter::File::Session - Harness output delegate for file output

VERSION
       Version 3.17

DESCRIPTION
       This provides file orientated output formatting for TAP::Harness.  It
       is particularly important when running with parallel tests, as it
       ensures that test results are not interleaved, even when run verbosely.

METHODS
   result
       Stores results for later output, all together.

   close_test
       When the test file finishes, outputs the summary, together.
