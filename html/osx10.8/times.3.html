TIMES(3)		 BSD Library Functions Manual		      TIMES(3)

NAME
     times -- process times

LIBRARY
     Standard C Library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/times.h>

     clock_t
     times(struct tms *buffer);

DESCRIPTION
     This interface is obsoleted by getrusage(2) and gettimeofday(2).

     The times() function returns the value of time in CLK_TCK's of a second
     since 0 hours, 0 minutes, 0 seconds, January 1, 1970, Coordinated Univer-
     sal Time.

     It also fills in the structure pointed to by buffer with time-accounting
     information.

     The tms structure is defined as follows:

	   struct tms {
		   clock_t tms_utime;
		   clock_t tms_stime;
		   clock_t tms_cutime;
		   clock_t tms_cstime;
	   };

     The elements of this structure are defined as follows:

     tms_utime	 The CPU time charged for the execution of user instructions.

     tms_stime	 The CPU time charged for execution by the system on behalf of
		 the process.

     tms_cutime  The sum of the tms_utimes and tms_cutimes of the child pro-
		 cesses.

     tms_cstime  The sum of the tms_stimes and tms_cstimes of the child pro-
		 cesses.

     All times are in CLK_TCK's of a second.

     The times of a terminated child process are included in the tms_cutime
     and tms_cstime elements of the parent when one of the wait(2) functions
     returns the process ID of the terminated child to the parent.  If an
     error occurs, times() returns the value ((clock_t)-1), and sets errno to
     indicate the error.

ERRORS
     The times() function may fail and set the global variable errno for any
     of the errors specified for the library routines getrusage(2) and
     gettimeofday(2).

SEE ALSO
     time(1), getrusage(2), gettimeofday(2), wait(2), clocks(7)

STANDARDS
     The times() function conforms to IEEE Std 1003.1-1988 (``POSIX.1'').
