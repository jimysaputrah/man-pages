NAME
       MooseX::Meta::Method::Authorized - Authorization in method calls

DESCRIPTION
       This trait provides support for verifying authorization before calling
       a method.

ATTRIBUTES
       requires
	   This attribute is an array reference with the values that are going
	   to be used by the verifier when checking this invocation.

       verifier
	   This is the object/class on which the "authorized_do" method is
	   going to be invoked. This is the object responsible for doing the
	   actual verification. It is invoked as:

	     $verifier->authorized_do($meth_obj, $code, @_)

	   It is expected that this method should die if the authorization is
	   not stablished.

	   The default value for this attribute is
	   MooseX::Meta::Method::Authorized::CheckRoles, which will get the
	   current user by calling the "user" method and list the roles given
	   to that user by invoking the "roles" method.

METHOD
       wrap
	   This role overrides wrap so that the actual method is only invoked
	   after the authorization being checked.
