NAME
       glColorPointer - define an array of colors


C SPECIFICATION
       void glColorPointer( GLint size,
			    GLenum type,
			    GLsizei stride,
			    const GLvoid *pointer )


PARAMETERS
       size	Specifies  the number of components per color. Must be 3 or 4.
		The initial value is 4.

       type	Specifies the data type of each color component in the	array.
		Symbolic   constants   GL_BYTE,   GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE,  GL_SHORT,
		GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT,  GL_INT,  GL_UNSIGNED_INT,  GL_FLOAT,   and
		GL_DOUBLE are accepted.  The initial value is GL_FLOAT.

       stride	Specifies  the	byte  offset  between  consecutive colors.  If
		stride is 0 (the initial value), the colors are understood  to
		be tightly packed in the array. The initial value is 0.

       pointer	Specifies  a pointer to the first component of the first color
		element in the array.

DESCRIPTION
       glColorPointer specifies the location and data  of an  array  of  color
       components  to use when rendering.  size specifies the number of compo-
       nents per color, and must be 3 or 4.  type specifies the data  type  of
       each  color  component,	and  stride specifies the byte stride from one
       color to the next allowing vertices and attributes to be packed into  a
       single  array  or stored in separate arrays.  (Single-array storage may
       be more efficient on some implementations; see glInterleavedArrays.)

       When a color array is specified, size, type, stride,  and  pointer  are
       saved as client-side state.

       To enable and disable the color array, call glEnableClientState and
       glDisableClientState  with the argument GL_COLOR_ARRAY. If enabled, the
       color   array	is    used    when    glDrawArrays,    glDrawElements,
       glDrawRangeElements, or glArrayElement is called.

NOTES
       glColorPointer is available only if the GL version is 1.1 or greater.

       The   color  array  is  initially  disabled  and  isn't	accessed  when
       glArrayElement, glDrawArrays, glDrawRangeElements, or glDrawElements is
       called.

       Execution  of  glColorPointer  is  not allowed between the execution of
       glBegin and the corresponding execution of glEnd, but an error  may  or
       may  not be generated. If no error is generated, the operation is unde-
       fined.

       glColorPointer is typically implemented on the client side.

       Color array parameters are client-side  state  and  are	therefore  not
       saved	or    restored	 by   glPushAttrib   and   glPopAttrib.    Use
       glPushClientAttrib and glPopClientAttrib instead.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if size is not 3 or 4.

       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if type is not an accepted value.

       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if stride is negative.

ASSOCIATED GETS
       glIsEnabled with argument GL_COLOR_ARRAY
       glGet with argument GL_COLOR_ARRAY_SIZE
       glGet with argument GL_COLOR_ARRAY_TYPE
       glGet with argument GL_COLOR_ARRAY_STRIDE
       glGetPointerv with argument GL_COLOR_ARRAY_POINTER
