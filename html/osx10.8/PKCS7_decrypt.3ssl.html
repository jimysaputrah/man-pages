NAME
       PKCS7_decrypt - decrypt content from a PKCS#7 envelopedData structure

SYNOPSIS
	#include &ltopenssl/pkcs7.h&gt

	int PKCS7_decrypt(PKCS7 *p7, EVP_PKEY *pkey, X509 *cert, BIO *data, int flags);

DESCRIPTION
       PKCS7_decrypt() extracts and decrypts the content from a PKCS#7
       envelopedData structure. pkey is the private key of the recipient, cert
       is the recipients certificate, data is a BIO to write the content to
       and flags is an optional set of flags.

NOTES
       OpenSSL_add_all_algorithms() (or equivalent) should be called before
       using this function or errors about unknown algorithms will occur.

       Although the recipients certificate is not needed to decrypt the data
       it is needed to locate the appropriate (of possible several) recipients
       in the PKCS#7 structure.

       The following flags can be passed in the flags parameter.

       If the PKCS7_TEXT flag is set MIME headers for type text/plain are
       deleted from the content. If the content is not of type text/plain then
       an error is returned.

RETURN VALUES
       PKCS7_decrypt() returns either 1 for success or 0 for failure.  The
       error can be obtained from ERR_get_error(3)

BUGS
       PKCS7_decrypt() must be passed the correct recipient key and
       certificate. It would be better if it could look up the correct key and
       certificate from a database.

       The lack of single pass processing and need to hold all data in memory
       as mentioned in PKCS7_sign() also applies to PKCS7_verify().

HISTORY
       PKCS7_decrypt() was added to OpenSSL 0.9.5
