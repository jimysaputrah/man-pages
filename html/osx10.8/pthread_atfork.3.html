PTHREAD_ATFORK(3)	 BSD Library Functions Manual	     PTHREAD_ATFORK(3)

NAME
     pthread_atfork -- register handlers to be called before and after fork()

SYNOPSIS
     #include <pthread.h>

     int
     pthread_atfork(void (*prepare)(void), void (*parent)(void),
	 void (*child)(void));

DESCRIPTION
     The pthread_atfork() function is used to register functions to be called
     before and after fork() The prepare handler is called before fork(),
     while the parent and child handlers are called after fork() in the parent
     and child process, respectively.  prepare handlers are called in reverse
     order of their registration, while parent and child handlers are called
     in the order in which they were registered. Any of the handlers may be
     NULL.

     Remember: only async-cancel-safe functions are allowed on the child side
     of fork()

RETURN VALUES
     If successful, the pthread_atfork() function will return zero; otherwise
     an error number will be returned to indicate the error.

ERRORS
     pthread_atfork() will fail if:

     [ENOMEM]		The system lacked the necessary resources to add
			another handler to the list.

SEE ALSO
     fork(2)

STANDARDS
     pthread_atfork() conforms to ISO/IEC 9945-1:1996 (``POSIX.1'').
