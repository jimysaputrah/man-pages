   "CLASS-&gtsafe_quote ITEM"
       Quotes an item to become safe against spaces in shell interpolation. An
       item is enclosed in double quotes if:

	 - the item contains spaces in the middle
	 - the item does not start with a quote

       This happens to avoid shell interpolation problems when whitespace is
       present in directory names.

       This method uses "commands_quote" to determine the correct quote. If
       "commands_quote" is a space, no quoting will take place.

       if it starts and ends with the same quote character: leave it as it is

       if it contains no whitespace: leave it as it is

       if it contains whitespace, then

       if it contains quotes: better leave it as it is

       else: quote it with the correct quote type for the box we're on
