NAME
       Math::Round - Perl extension for rounding numbers

SYNOPSIS
	 use Math::Round qw(...those desired... or :all);

	 $rounded = round($scalar);
	 @rounded = round(LIST...);
	 $rounded = nearest($target, $scalar);
	 @rounded = nearest($target, LIST...);

	 # and other functions as described below

DESCRIPTION
       Math::Round supplies functions that will round numbers in different
       ways.  The functions round and nearest are exported by default; others
       are available as described below.  "use ... qw(:all)" exports all
       functions.

FUNCTIONS
       round LIST
	 Rounds the number(s) to the nearest integer.  In scalar context,
	 returns a single value; in list context, returns a list of values.
	 Numbers that are halfway between two integers are rounded "to
	 infinity"; i.e., positive values are rounded up (e.g., 2.5 becomes 3)
	 and negative values down (e.g., -2.5 becomes -3).

       round_even LIST
	 Rounds the number(s) to the nearest integer.  In scalar context,
	 returns a single value; in list context, returns a list of values.
	 Numbers that are halfway between two integers are rounded to the
	 nearest even number; e.g., 2.5 becomes 2, 3.5 becomes 4, and -2.5
	 becomes -2.

       round_odd LIST
	 Rounds the number(s) to the nearest integer.  In scalar context,
	 returns a single value; in list context, returns a list of values.
	 Numbers that are halfway between two integers are rounded to the
	 nearest odd number; e.g., 3.5 becomes 3, 4.5 becomes 5, and -3.5
	 becomes -3.

       round_rand LIST
	 Rounds the number(s) to the nearest integer.  In scalar context,
	 returns a single value; in list context, returns a list of values.
	 Numbers that are halfway between two integers are rounded up or down
	 in a random fashion.  For example, in a large number of trials, 2.5
	 will become 2 half the time and 3 half the time.

       nearest TARGET, LIST
	 Rounds the number(s) to the nearest multiple of the target value.
	 TARGET must be positive.  In scalar context, returns a single value;
	 in list context, returns a list of values.  Numbers that are halfway
	 between two multiples of the target will be rounded to infinity.  For
	 example:

	   nearest(10, 44)    yields  40
	   nearest(10, 46)	      50
	   nearest(10, 45)	      50
	   nearest(25, 328)	     325
	   nearest(.1, 4.567)	       4.6
	   nearest(10, -45)	     -50

       nearest_ceil TARGET, LIST
	 Rounds the number(s) to the nearest multiple of the target value.
	 TARGET must be positive.  In scalar context, returns a single value;
	 in list context, returns a list of values.  Numbers that are halfway
	 between two multiples of the target will be rounded to the ceiling,
	 i.e. the next algebraically higher multiple.  For example:

	   nearest_ceil(10, 44)    yields  40
	   nearest_ceil(10, 45) 	   50
	   nearest_ceil(10, -45)	  -40

       nearest_floor TARGET, LIST
	 Rounds the number(s) to the nearest multiple of the target value.
	 TARGET must be positive.  In scalar context, returns a single value;
	 in list context, returns a list of values.  Numbers that are halfway
	 between two multiples of the target will be rounded to the floor,
	 i.e. the next algebraically lower multiple.  For example:

	   nearest_floor(10, 44)    yields  40
	   nearest_floor(10, 45)	    40
	   nearest_floor(10, -45)	   -50

       nearest_rand TARGET, LIST
	 Rounds the number(s) to the nearest multiple of the target value.
	 TARGET must be positive.  In scalar context, returns a single value;
	 in list context, returns a list of values.  Numbers that are halfway
	 between two multiples of the target will be rounded up or down in a
	 random fashion.  For example, in a large number of trials,
	 "nearest(10, 45)" will yield 40 half the time and 50 half the time.

       nlowmult TARGET, LIST
	 Returns the next lower multiple of the number(s) in LIST.  TARGET
	 must be positive.  In scalar context, returns a single value; in list
	 context, returns a list of values.  Numbers that are between two
	 multiples of the target will be adjusted to the nearest multiples of
	 LIST that are algebraically lower. For example:

	   nlowmult(10, 44)    yields  40
	   nlowmult(10, 46)	       40
	   nlowmult(25, 328)	      325
	   nlowmult(.1, 4.567)		4.5
	   nlowmult(10, -41)	      -50

       nhimult TARGET, LIST
	 Returns the next higher multiple of the number(s) in LIST.  TARGET
	 must be positive.  In scalar context, returns a single value; in list
	 context, returns a list of values.  Numbers that are between two
	 multiples of the target will be adjusted to the nearest multiples of
	 LIST that are algebraically higher. For example:

	   nhimult(10, 44)    yields  50
	   nhimult(10, 46)	      50
	   nhimult(25, 328)	     350
	   nhimult(.1, 4.512)	       4.6
	   nhimult(10, -49)	     -40

VARIABLE
       The variable $Math::Round::half is used by most routines in this
       module. Its value is very slightly larger than 0.5, for reasons
       explained below. If you find that your application does not deliver the
       expected results, you may reset this variable at will.

STANDARD FLOATING-POINT DISCLAIMER
       Floating-point numbers are, of course, a rational subset of the real
       numbers, so calculations with them are not always exact.  Numbers that
       are supposed to be halfway between two others may surprise you; for
       instance, 0.85 may not be exactly halfway between 0.8 and 0.9, and
       (0.75 - 0.7) may not be the same as (0.85 - 0.8).

       In order to give more predictable results, these routines use a value
       for one-half that is slightly larger than 0.5.  Nevertheless, if the
       numbers to be rounded are stored as floating-point, they will be
       subject, as usual, to the mercies of your hardware, your C compiler,
       etc.
