NAME
       deleteln,  wdeleteln, insdelln, winsdelln, insertln, winsertln - delete
       and insert lines in a curses window

SYNOPSIS
       #include &ltcurses.h&gt

       int deleteln(void);
       int wdeleteln(WINDOW *win);
       int insdelln(int n);
       int winsdelln(WINDOW *win, int n);
       int insertln(void);
       int winsertln(WINDOW *win);

DESCRIPTION
       The deleteln and wdeleteln routines delete the line under the cursor in
       the  window;  all  lines  below the current line are moved up one line.
       The bottom line of the window is cleared.  The cursor position does not
       change.

       The  insdelln  and  winsdelln  routines, for positive n, insert n lines
       into the specified window above the current line.  The n  bottom  lines
       are  lost.  For negative n, delete n lines (starting with the one under
       the cursor), and move the remaining lines up.  The bottom n  lines  are
       cleared.  The current cursor position remains the same.

       The  insertln and winsertln routines insert a blank line above the cur-
       rent line and the bottom line is lost.

RETURN VALUE
       All routines return the integer ERR upon failure and an OK (SVr4 speci-
       fies  only  "an	integer value other than ERR") upon successful comple-
       tion.

       X/Open defines no error conditions.  In	this  implementation,  if  the
       window parameter is null, an error is returned.

PORTABILITY
       These functions are described in the XSI Curses standard, Issue 4.  The
       standard specifies that they return ERR on failure,  but  specifies  no
       error conditions.

NOTES
       Note that all but winsdelln may be macros.

       These  routines do not require a hardware line delete or insert feature
       in  the	terminal.   In	fact,  they  will  not	 use   hardware   line
       delete/insert  unless idlok(..., TRUE) has been set on the current win-
       dow.
