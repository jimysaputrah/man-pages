NAME
     basename -- extract the base portion of a pathname

SYNOPSIS
     #include <libgen.h>

     char *
     basename(char *path);

DESCRIPTION
     The basename() function returns the last component from the pathname
     pointed to by path, deleting any trailing `/' characters.	If path con-
     sists entirely of `/' characters, a pointer to the string "/" is
     returned.	If path is a null pointer or the empty string, a pointer to
     the string "." is returned.

RETURN VALUES
     On successful completion, basename() returns a pointer to the last compo-
     nent of path.

     If basename() fails, a null pointer is returned and the global variable
     errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
     The following error codes may be set in errno:

     [ENAMETOOLONG]	The path component to be returned was larger than
			MAXPATHLEN.

WARNINGS
     The basename() function returns a pointer to internal static storage
     space that will be overwritten by subsequent calls.  The function may
     modify the string pointed to by path.

LEGACY SYNOPSIS
     #include <libgen.h>

     char *
     basename(const char *path);

     In legacy mode, path will not be changed.

SEE ALSO
     basename(1), dirname(1), dirname(3), compat(5)

STANDARDS
     The basename() function conforms to X/Open Portability Guide Issue 4,
     Version 2 (``XPG4.2'').

HISTORY
     The basename() function first appeared in OpenBSD 2.2 and FreeBSD 4.2.
