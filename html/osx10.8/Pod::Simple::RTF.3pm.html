NAME
       Pod::Simple::RTF -- format Pod as RTF

SYNOPSIS
	 perl -MPod::Simple::RTF -e \
	  "exit Pod::Simple::RTF->filter(shift)->any_errata_seen" \
	  thingy.pod > thingy.rtf

DESCRIPTION
       This class is a formatter that takes Pod and renders it as RTF, good
       for viewing/printing in MSWord, WordPad/write.exe, TextEdit, etc.

       This is a subclass of Pod::Simple and inherits all its methods.

FORMAT CONTROL ATTRIBUTES
       You can set these attributes on the parser object before you call
       "parse_file" (or a similar method) on it:

       $parser->head1_halfpoint_size( halfpoint_integer );
       $parser->head2_halfpoint_size( halfpoint_integer );
       $parser->head3_halfpoint_size( halfpoint_integer );
       $parser->head4_halfpoint_size( halfpoint_integer );
	   These methods set the size (in half-points, like 52 for 26-point)
	   that these heading levels will appear as.

       $parser->codeblock_halfpoint_size( halfpoint_integer );
	   This method sets the size (in half-points, like 21 for 10.5-point)
	   that codeblocks ("verbatim sections") will appear as.

       $parser->header_halfpoint_size( halfpoint_integer );
	   This method sets the size (in half-points, like 15 for 7.5-point)
	   that the header on each page will appear in.  The header is usually
	   just "modulename p. pagenumber".

       $parser->normal_halfpoint_size( halfpoint_integer );
	   This method sets the size (in half-points, like 26 for 13-point)
	   that normal paragraphic text will appear in.

       $parser->no_proofing_exemptions( true_or_false );
	   Set this value to true if you don't want the formatter to try
	   putting a hidden code on all Perl symbols (as best as it can notice
	   them) that labels them as being not in English, and so not worth
	   spellchecking.

       $parser->doc_lang( microsoft_decimal_language_code )
	   This sets the language code to tag this document as being in. By
	   default, it is currently the value of the environment variable
	   "RTFDEFLANG", or if that's not set, then the value 1033 (for US
	   English).

	   Setting this appropriately is useful if you want to use the RTF to
	   spellcheck, and/or if you want it to hyphenate right.

	   Here are some notable values:

	     1033  US English
	     2057  UK English
	     3081  Australia English
	     4105  Canada English
	     1034  Spain Spanish
	     2058  Mexico Spanish
	     1031  Germany German
	     1036  France French
	     3084  Canada French
	     1035  Finnish
	     1044  Norwegian (Bokmal)
	     2068  Norwegian (Nynorsk)

       If you are particularly interested in customizing this module's output
       even more, see the source and/or write to me.
