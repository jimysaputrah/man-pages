NAME
       Module::CoreList - what modules shipped with versions of perl

SYNOPSIS
	use Module::CoreList;

	print $Module::CoreList::version{5.00503}{CPAN}; # prints 1.48

	print Module::CoreList->first_release('File::Spec');	     # prints 5.00405
	print Module::CoreList->first_release_by_date('File::Spec'); # prints 5.005
	print Module::CoreList->first_release('File::Spec', 0.82);   # prints 5.006001

	print join ', ', Module::CoreList->find_modules(qr/Data/);
	   # prints 'Data::Dumper'
	print join ', ', Module::CoreList->find_modules(qr/test::h.*::.*s/i, 5.008008);
	   # prints 'Test::Harness::Assert, Test::Harness::Straps'

	print join ", ", @{ $Module::CoreList::families{5.005} };
	   # prints "5.005, 5.00503, 5.00504"

DESCRIPTION
       Module::CoreList provides information on which core and dual-life
       modules shipped with each version of perl.

       It provides a number of mechanisms for querying this information.

       There is a utility called corelist provided with this module which is a
       convenient way of querying from the command-line.

       There is a functional programming API available for programmers to
       query information.

       Programmers may also query the contained hash structures to find
       relevant information.

FUNCTIONS API
       These are the functions that are available, they may either be called
       as functions or class methods:

	 Module::CoreList::first_release('File::Spec'); # as a function

	 Module::CoreList->first_release('File::Spec'); # class method

       "first_release( MODULE )"
	   Behaviour since version 2.11

	   Requires a MODULE name as an argument, returns the perl version
	   when that module first appeared in core as ordered by perl version
	   number or undef ( in scalar context ) or an empty list ( in list
	   context ) if that module is not in core.

       "first_release_by_date( MODULE )"
	   Requires a MODULE name as an argument, returns the perl version
	   when that module first appeared in core as ordered by release date
	   or undef ( in scalar context ) or an empty list ( in list context )
	   if that module is not in core.

       "find_modules( REGEX, [ LIST OF PERLS ] )"
	   Takes a regex as an argument, returns a list of modules that match
	   the regex given.  If only a regex is provided applies to all
	   modules in all perl versions. Optionally you may provide a list of
	   perl versions to limit the regex search.

       "find_version( PERL_VERSION )"
	   Takes a perl version as an argument. Returns that perl version if
	   it exists or "undef" otherwise.

       "is_deprecated( MODULE, PERL_VERSION )"
	   Available in version 2.22 and above.

	   Returns true if MODULE is marked as deprecated in PERL_VERSION.  If
	   PERL_VERSION is omitted, it defaults to the current version of
	   Perl.

       "removed_from( MODULE )"
	   Available in version 2.32 and above

	   Takes a module name as an argument, returns the first perl version
	   where that module was removed from core. Returns undef if the given
	   module was never in core or remains in core.

       "removed_from_by_date( MODULE )"
	   Available in version 2.32 and above

	   Takes a module name as an argument, returns the first perl version
	   by release date where that module was removed from core. Returns
	   undef if the given module was never in core or remains in core.

DATA STRUCTURES
       These are the hash data structures that are available:

       %Module::CoreList::version
	   A hash of hashes that is keyed on perl version as indicated in $].
	   The second level hash is module => version pairs.

	   Note, it is possible for the version of a module to be unspecified,
	   whereby the value is "undef", so use "exists $version{$foo}{$bar}"
	   if that's what you're testing for.

	   Starting with 2.10, the special module name "Unicode" refers to the
	   version of the Unicode Character Database bundled with Perl.

       %Module::CoreList::released
	   Keyed on perl version this contains ISO formatted versions of the
	   release dates, as gleaned from perlhist.

       %Module::CoreList::families
	   New, in 1.96, a hash that clusters known perl releases by their
	   major versions.

       %Module::CoreList::deprecated
	   A hash of hashes keyed on perl version and on module name.  If a
	   module is defined it indicates that that module is deprecated in
	   that perl version and is scheduled for removal from core at some
	   future point.

       %Module::CoreList::upstream
	   A hash that contains information on where patches should be
	   directed for each core module.

	   UPSTREAM indicates where patches should go. "undef" implies that
	   this hasn't been discussed for the module at hand.  "blead"
	   indicates that the copy of the module in the blead sources is to be
	   considered canonical, "cpan" means that the module on CPAN is to be
	   patched first. "first-come" means that blead can be patched freely
	   if it is in sync with the latest release on CPAN.

       %Module::CoreList::bug_tracker
	   A hash that contains information on the appropriate bug tracker for
	   each core module.

	   BUGS is an email or url to post bug reports.  For modules with
	   UPSTREAM => 'blead', use perl5-porters@perl.org.  rt.cpan.org
	   appears to automatically provide a URL for CPAN modules; any value
	   given here overrides the default:
	   http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=$ModuleName
