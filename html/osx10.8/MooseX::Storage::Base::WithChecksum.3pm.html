NAME
       MooseX::Storage::Base::WithChecksum - A more secure serialization role

DESCRIPTION
       This is an early implementation of a more secure Storage role, which
       does integrity checks on the data. It is still being developed so I
       recommend using it with caution.

       Any thoughts, ideas or suggestions on improving our technique are very
       welcome.

METHODS
       pack (?$salt)
       unpack ($data, ?$salt)

   Introspection
       meta

BUGS
       All complex software has bugs lurking in it, and this module is no
       exception. If you find a bug please either email me, or add the bug to
       cpan-RT.
