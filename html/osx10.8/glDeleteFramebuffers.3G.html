NAME
       glDeleteFramebuffers - delete framebuffer objects

C SPECIFICATION
       void glDeleteFramebuffers(GLsizei n, GLuint *framebuffers);

PARAMETERS
       n
	   Specifies the number of framebuffer objects to be deleted.

       framebuffers
	   A pointer to an array containing n framebuffer objects to be
	   deleted.

DESCRIPTION
       glDeleteFramebuffers deletes the n framebuffer objects whose names are
       stored in the array addressed by framebuffers. The name zero is
       reserved by the GL and is silently ignored, should it occur in
       framebuffers, as are other unused names. Once a framebuffer object is
       deleted, its name is again unused and it has no attachments. If a
       framebuffer that is currently bound to one or more of the targets
       GL_DRAW_FRAMEBUFFER or GL_READ_FRAMEBUFFER is deleted, it is as though
       glBindFramebuffer() had been executed with the corresponding target and
       framebuffer zero.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if n is negative.
