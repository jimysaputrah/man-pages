PYTHON(1)		  BSD General Commands Manual		     PYTHON(1)

NAME
     python, pythonw -- an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented program-
     ming language

SYNOPSIS
     python ...
     pythonw ...

DESCRIPTION
     To support multiple versions, the programs named python and pythonw now
     just select the real version of Python to run, depending on various set-
     tings.  (As of Python 2.5, python and pythonw are interchangeable; both
     execute Python in the context of an application bundle, which means they
     have access to the Graphical User Interface; thus both can, when properly
     programmed, display windows, dialogs, etc.)  The current supported ver-
     sions are 2.6 and 2.7, with the default being 2.6.  Use

	   % man python2.6
	   % man python2.7
	   % man pythonw2.6
	   % man pythonw2.7

     to see the man page for a specific version.  Without a version specified,

	   % man pydoc

     and the like, will show the man page for the (unmodified) default version
     of Python (2.6).  To see the man page for a specific version, use, for
     example,

	   % man pydoc2.7

CHANGING THE DEFAULT PYTHON
     Using

	   % defaults write com.apple.versioner.python Version 2.7

     will make version 2.7 the user default when running the both the python
     and pythonw commands (versioner is the internal name of the version-
     selection software used).

     To set a system-wide default, replace `com.apple.versioner.python' with
     `/Library/Preferences/com.apple.versioner.python' (admin privileges will
     be required).

     The environment variable VERSIONER_PYTHON_VERSION can also be used to set
     the python and pythonw version:

	   % export VERSIONER_PYTHON_VERSION=2.7 # Bourne-like shells
		or
	   % setenv VERSIONER_PYTHON_VERSION 2.7 # C-like shells
	   % python ...

     This environment variable takes precedence over the preference file set-
     tings.

64-BIT SUPPORT
     Versions 2.6 and 2.7 support 64-bit execution (which is on by default).

     Like the version of Python, the python command can select between 32 and
     64-bit execution (when both are available).  Use:

	   % defaults write com.apple.versioner.python Prefer-32-Bit -bool yes

     to make 32-bit execution the user default (using
     `/Library/Preferences/com.apple.versioner.python' will set the system-
     wide default).  The environment variable VERSIONER_PYTHON_PREFER_32_BIT
     can also be used (has precedence over the preference file):

	   % export VERSIONER_PYTHON_PREFER_32_BIT=yes # Bourne-like shells
		or
	   % setenv VERSIONER_PYTHON_PREFER_32_BIT yes # C-like shells

     Again, the preference setting and environmental variable applies to both
     python and pythonw.

USING A SPECIFIC VERSION
     Rather than using the python command, one can use a specific version
     directly.	For example, running python2.7 from the command line will run
     the 2.7 version of Python, independent of what the default version of
     Python is.

     One can use a specific version of Python on the #! line of a script, but
     that may have portability and future compatibility issues.

     Note that the preference files and environment variable that apply to the
     python command, do not apply when running a specific version of Python.
     In particular, running python2.6 will always default to 64-bit execution
     (unless one uses the arch(1) command to specifically select a 32-bit
     architecture).
