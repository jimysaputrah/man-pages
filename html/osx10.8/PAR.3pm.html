NAME
       PAR - Perl Archive Toolkit

SYNOPSIS
       (If you want to make an executable that contains all module, scripts
       and data files, please consult the pp utility instead. pp used to be
       part of the PAR distribution but is now shipped as part of the
       PAR::Packer distribution instead.)

       Following examples assume a foo.par file in Zip format.

       To use Hello.pm from ./foo.par:

	   % perl -MPAR=./foo.par -MHello
	   % perl -MPAR=./foo -MHello	       # the .par part is optional

       Same thing, but search foo.par in the @INC;

	   % perl -MPAR -Ifoo.par -MHello
	   % perl -MPAR -Ifoo -MHello	       # ditto

       Following paths inside the PAR file are searched:

	   /lib/
	   /arch/
	   /i386-freebsd/	       # i.e. $Config{archname}
	   /5.8.0/		       # i.e. $Config{version}
	   /5.8.0/i386-freebsd/        # both of the above
	   /

       PAR files may also (recursively) contain other PAR files.  All files
       under following paths will be considered as PAR files and searched as
       well:

	   /par/i386-freebsd/	       # i.e. $Config{archname}
	   /par/5.8.0/		       # i.e. $Config{version}
	   /par/5.8.0/i386-freebsd/    # both of the above
	   /par/

       Run script/test.pl or test.pl from foo.par:

	   % perl -MPAR foo.par test.pl        # only when $0 ends in '.par'

       However, if the .par archive contains either script/main.pl or main.pl,
       then it is used instead:

	   % perl -MPAR foo.par test.pl        # runs main.pl; @ARGV is 'test.pl'

       Use in a program:

	   use PAR 'foo.par';
	   use Hello; # reads within foo.par

	   # PAR::read_file() returns a file inside any loaded PARs
	   my $conf = PAR::read_file('data/MyConfig.yaml');

	   # PAR::par_handle() returns an Archive::Zip handle
	   my $zip = PAR::par_handle('foo.par')
	   my $src = $zip->memberNamed('lib/Hello.pm')->contents;

       You can also use wildcard characters:

	   use PAR '/home/foo/*.par';  # loads all PAR files in that directory

       Since version 0.950, you can also use a different syntax for loading
       .par archives:

	   use PAR { file => 'foo.par' }, { file => 'otherfile.par' };

       Why? Because you can also do this:

	   use PAR { file => 'foo.par, fallback => 1 };
	   use Foo::Bar;

       Foo::Bar will be searched in the system libs first and loaded from
       foo.par if it wasn't found!

	   use PAR { file => 'foo.par', run => 'myscript' };

       This will load foo.par as usual and then execute the script/myscript
       file from the archive. Note that your program will not regain control.
       When script/myscript exits, so does your main program. To make this
       more useful, you can defer this to runtime: (otherwise equivalent)

	   require PAR;
	   PAR->import( { file => 'foo.par', run => 'myscript' } );

       If you have PAR::Repository::Client installed, you can do this:

	   use PAR { repository => 'http://foo/bar/' };
	   use Module; # not locally installed!

       And PAR will fetch any modules you don't have from the specified PAR
       repository. For details on how this works, have a look at the SEE ALSO
       section below. Instead of an URL or local path, you can construct an
       PAR::Repository::Client object manually and pass that to PAR.  If you
       specify the "install => 1" option in the "use PAR" line above, the
       distribution containing "Module" will be permanently installed on your
       system. ("use PAR { repository => 'http://foo/bar', install => 1 };")

       Furthermore, there is an "upgrade => 1" option that checks for upgrades
       in the repository in addition to installing. Please note that an
       upgraded version of a module is only loaded on the next run of your
       application.

       Adding the "dependencies => 1" option will enable
       PAR::Repository::Client's static dependency resolution
       (PAR::Repository::Client 0.23 and up).

       Finally, you can combine the "run" and "repository" options to run an
       application directly from a repository! (And you can add the "install"
       option, too.)

	 use PAR { repository => 'http://foo/bar/', run => 'my_app' };
	 # Will not reach this point as we executed my_app,

DESCRIPTION
       This module lets you use special zip files, called Perl Archives, as
       libraries from which Perl modules can be loaded.

       It supports loading XS modules by overriding DynaLoader bootstrapping
       methods; it writes shared object file to a temporary file at the time
       it is needed.

       A .par file is mostly a zip of the blib/ directory after the build
       process of a CPAN distribution. To generate a .par file yourself, all
       you have to do is compress the modules under arch/ and lib/, e.g.:

	   % perl Makefile.PL
	   % make
	   % cd blib
	   % zip -r mymodule.par arch/ lib/

       Afterward, you can just use mymodule.par anywhere in your @INC, use
       PAR, and it will Just Work. Support for generating .par files is going
       to be in the next (beyond 0.2805) release of Module::Build.

       For convenience, you can set the "PERL5OPT" environment variable to
       "-MPAR" to enable "PAR" processing globally (the overhead is small if
       not used); setting it to "-MPAR=/path/to/mylib.par" will load a
       specific PAR file.  Alternatively, consider using the par.pl utility
       bundled with the PAR::Packer distribution, or using the self-contained
       parl utility which is also distributed with PAR::Packer on machines
       without PAR.pm installed.

       Note that self-containing scripts and executables created with par.pl
       and pp may also be used as .par archives:

	   % pp -o packed.exe source.pl        # generate packed.exe (see PAR::Packer)
	   % perl -MPAR=packed.exe other.pl    # this also works
	   % perl -MPAR -Ipacked.exe other.pl  # ditto

       Please see "SYNOPSIS" for most typical use cases.

NOTES
       Settings in META.yml packed inside the PAR file may affect PAR's
       operation.  For example, pp provides the "-C" ("--clean") option to
       control the default behavior of temporary file creation.

       Currently, pp-generated PAR files may attach four PAR-specific
       attributes in META.yml:

	   par:
	     clean: 0	       # default value of PAR_CLEAN
	     signature: ''     # key ID of the SIGNATURE file
	     verbatim: 0       # was packed prerequisite's PODs preserved?
	     version: x.xx     # PAR.pm version that generated this PAR

       User-defined environment variables, like PAR_GLOBAL_CLEAN, always
       overrides the ones set in META.yml.  The algorithm for generating
       caching/temporary directory is as follows:

       o   If PAR_GLOBAL_TEMP is specified, use it as the cache directory for
	   extracted libraries, and do not clean it up after execution.

       o   If PAR_GLOBAL_TEMP is not set, but PAR_CLEAN is specified, set
	   PAR_GLOBAL_TEMP to "TEMP/par-USER/temp-PID/", cleaning it after
	   execution.

       o   If both are not set,  use "TEMP/par-USER/cache-HASH/" as the
	   PAR_GLOBAL_TEMP, reusing any existing files inside.

       Here is a description of the variables the previous paths.

       o   TEMP is a temporary directory, which can be set via
	   $ENV{PAR_GLOBAL_TMPDIR}, $ENV{TMPDIR}, $ENV{TEMPDIR}, $ENV{TEMP} or
	   $ENV{TMP}, in that order of priority.  If none of those are set,
	   C:\TEMP, /tmp are checked.  If neither of them exists, . is used.

       o   USER is the user name, or SYSTEM if none can be found.  On Win32,
	   this is $Win32::LoginName.  On Unix, this is $ENV{USERNAME} or
	   $ENV{USER}.

       o   PID is the process ID.  Forked children use the parent's PID.

       o   HASH is a crypto-hash of the entire par file or executable,
	   calculated at creation time.  This value can be overloaded with
	   "pp"'s --tempdir parameter.

       By default, PAR strips POD sections from bundled modules. In case that
       causes trouble, you can turn this off by setting the environment
       variable "PAR_VERBATIM" to 1.

   import options
       When you "use PAR {...}" or call PAR->import({...}), the following
       options are available.

	 PAR->import({ file => 'foo.par' });
	 # or
	 PAR->import({ repository => 'http://foo/bar/' });

       file
	   The par filename.

	   You must pass one option of either 'file' or 'repository'.

       repository
	   A par repository (exclusive of file)

       fallback
	   Search the system @INC before the par.

	   Off by default for loading .par files via "file =" ...>.  On by
	   default for PAR repositories.

	   To prefer loading modules from a repository over the locally
	   installed modules, you can load the repository as follows:

	     use PAR { repository => 'http://foo/bar/', fallback => 0 };

       run The name of a script to run in the par.  Exits when done.

       no_shlib_unpack
	   Skip unpacking bundled dynamic libraries from shlib/$archname.  The
	   client may have them installed, or you may wish to cache them
	   yourself.  In either case, they must end up in the standard install
	   location (such as /usr/local/lib/) or in $ENV{PAR_TEMP} before you
	   require the module which needs them.  If they are not accessible
	   before you require the dependent module, perl will die with a
	   message such as "cannot open shared object file..."

       PAR supports the prefork module. It declares various run-time
       dependencies so you can use the prefork module to get streamlined
       processes in a forking environment.
