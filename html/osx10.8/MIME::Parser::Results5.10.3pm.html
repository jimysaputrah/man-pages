NAME
       MIME::Parser::Results - results of the last entity parsed

SYNOPSIS
       Before reading further, you should see MIME::Parser to make sure that
       you understand where this module fits into the grand scheme of things.
       Go on, do it now.  I'll wait.

       Ready?  Ok...

	  ### Do parse, get results:
	  my $entity = eval { $parser->parse(\*STDIN); };
	  my $results  = $parser->results;

	  ### Get all messages logged:
	  @msgs = $results->msgs;

	  ### Get messages of specific types (also tests if there were problems):
	  $had_errors	= $results->errors;
	  $had_warnings = $results->warnings;

	  ### Get outermost header:
	  $top_head  = $results->top_head;

DESCRIPTION
       Results from the last MIME::Parser parse.

PUBLIC INTERFACE
       new Constructor.

       msgs
	   Instance method.  Return all messages that we logged, in order.
	   Every message is a string beginning with its type followed by ": ";
	   the current types are "debug", "warning", and "error".

       errors
	   Instance method.  Return all error messages that we logged, in
	   order.  A convenience front-end onto msgs().

       warnings
	   Instance method.  Return all warning messages that we logged, in
	   order.  A convenience front-end onto msgs().

       top_head
	   Instance method.  Return the topmost header, if we were able to
	   read it.  This may be useful if the parse fails.
