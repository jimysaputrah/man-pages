NAME
       DBIx::Class::Storage::TxnScopeGuard - Scope-based transaction handling

SYNOPSIS
	sub foo {
	  my ($self, $schema) = @_;

	  my $guard = $schema-&gttxn_scope_guard;

	  # Multiple database operations here

	  $guard-&gtcommit;
	}

DESCRIPTION
       An object that behaves much like Scope::Guard, but hardcoded to do the
       right thing with transactions in DBIx::Class.

METHODS
   new
       Creating an instance of this class will start a new transaction (by
       implicitly calling "txn_begin" in DBIx::Class::Storage. Expects a
       DBIx::Class::Storage object as its only argument.

   commit
       Commit the transaction, and stop guarding the scope. If this method is
       not called and this object goes out of scope (e.g. an exception is
       thrown) then the transaction is rolled back, via "txn_rollback" in
       DBIx::Class::Storage

SEE ALSO
       "txn_scope_guard" in DBIx::Class::Schema.
