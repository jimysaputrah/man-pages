NAME
       APR::Bucket - Perl API for manipulating APR Buckets

Synopsis
	 use APR::Bucket ();
	 my $ba = $c-&gtbucket_alloc;

	 $b1 = APR::Bucket-&gtnew($ba, "aaa");
	 $b2 = APR::Bucket::eos_create($ba);
	 $b3 = APR::Bucket::flush_create($ba);

	 $b2-&gtis_eos;
	 $b3-&gtis_flush;

	 $len = $b1-&gtlength;
	 $len = $b1-&gtread($data);
	 $type = $b1-&gttype;

	 $b1-&gtinsert_after($b2);
	 $b1-&gtinsert_before($b3);
	 $b1-&gtremove;
	 $b1-&gtdestroy;

	 $b2-&gtdelete; # remove+destroy

	 $b4 = APR::Bucket-&gtnew($ba, "to be setaside");
	 $b4-&gtsetaside($pool);

Description
       "APR::Bucket" allows you to create, manipulate and delete APR buckets.

       You will probably find the various insert methods confusing, the tip is
       to read the function right to left. The following code sample helps to
       visualize the operations:

	 my $bb = APR::Brigade-&gtnew($r-&gtpool, $ba);
	 my $d1 = APR::Bucket-&gtnew($ba, "d1");
	 my $d2 = APR::Bucket-&gtnew($ba, "d2");
	 my $f1 = APR::Bucket::flush_create($ba);
	 my $f2 = APR::Bucket::flush_create($ba);
	 my $e1 = APR::Bucket::eos_create($ba);
				  # head-&gttail
	 $bb-&gtinsert_head(  $d1); # head-&gtd1-&gttail
	 $d1-&gtinsert_after( $d2); # head-&gtd1-&gtd2-&gttail
	 $d2-&gtinsert_before($f1); # head-&gtd1-&gtf1-&gtd2-&gttail
	 $d2-&gtinsert_after( $f2); # head-&gtd1-&gtf1-&gtd2-&gtf2-&gttail
	 $bb-&gtinsert_tail(  $e1); # head-&gtd1-&gtf1-&gtd2-&gtf2-&gte1-&gttail

API
       "APR::Bucket" provides the following functions and/or methods:

   "delete"
       Tell the bucket to remove itself from the bucket brigade it belongs to,
       and destroy itself.

	 $bucket-&gtdelete();

       obj: $bucket ( "APR::Bucket object" )
       ret: no return value
       since: 2.0.00

       If the bucket is not attached to any bucket brigade then this operation
       just destroys the bucket.

       "delete" is a convenience wrapper, internally doing:

	 $b-&gtremove;
	 $b-&gtdestroy;

       Examples:

       Assuming that $bb already exists and filled with buckets, replace the
       existing data buckets with new buckets with upcased data;

	 for (my $b = $bb-&gtfirst; $b; $b = $bb-&gtnext($b)) {
	    if ($b-&gtread(my $data)) {
		 my $nb = APR::Bucket-&gtnew($bb-&gtbucket_alloc, uc $data);
		 $b-&gtinsert_before($nb);
		 $b-&gtdelete;
		 $b = $nb;
	     }
	 }

   "destroy"
       Free the resources used by a bucket. If multiple buckets refer to the
       same resource it is freed when the last one goes away.

	 $bucket-&gtdestroy();

       obj: $bucket ( "APR::Bucket object" )
       ret: no return value
       since: 2.0.00

       A bucket needs to be destroyed if it was removed from a bucket brigade,
       to avoid memory leak.

       If a bucket is linked to a bucket brigade, it needs to be removed from
       it, before it can be destroyed.

       Usually instead of calling:

	 $b-&gtremove;
	 $b-&gtdestroy;

       it's better to call "delete" which does exactly that.

   "eos_create"
       Create an EndOfStream bucket.

	 $b = APR::Bucket::eos_create($ba);

       arg1: $ba ( "APR::BucketAlloc object" )
	   The freelist from which this bucket should be allocated

       ret: $b ( "APR::Bucket object" )
	   The new bucket

       since: 2.0.00

       This bucket type indicates that there is no more data coming from down
       the filter stack.  All filters should flush any buffered data at this
       point.

       Example:

	 use APR::Bucket ();
	 use Apache2::Connection ();
	 my $ba = $c-&gtbucket_alloc;
	 my $eos_b = APR::Bucket::eos_create($ba);

   "flush_create"
       Create a flush bucket.

	 $b = APR::Bucket::flush_create($ba);

       arg1: $ba ( "APR::BucketAlloc object" )
	   The freelist from which this bucket should be allocated

       ret: $b ( "APR::Bucket object" )
	   The new bucket

       since: 2.0.00

       This bucket type indicates that filters should flush their data.  There
       is no guarantee that they will flush it, but this is the best we can
       do.

   "insert_after"
       Insert a list of buckets after a specified bucket

	 $after_bucket-&gtinsert_after($add_bucket);

       obj: $after_bucket ( "APR::Bucket object" )
	   The bucket to insert after

       arg1: $add_bucket ( "APR::Bucket object" )
	   The buckets to insert. It says buckets, since $add_bucket may have
	   more buckets attached after itself.

       ret: no return value
       since: 2.0.00

   "insert_before"
       Insert a list of buckets before a specified bucket

	 $before_bucket-&gtinsert_before($add_bucket);

       obj: $before_bucket ( "APR::Bucket object" )
	   The bucket to insert before

       arg1: $add_bucket ( "APR::Bucket object" )
	   The buckets to insert. It says buckets, since $add_bucket may have
	   more buckets attached after itself.

       ret: no return value
       since: 2.0.00

   "is_eos"
       Determine if a bucket is an EOS bucket

	 $ret = $bucket-&gtis_eos();

       obj: $bucket ( "APR::Bucket object" )
       ret: $ret ( boolean )
       since: 2.0.00

   "is_flush"
       Determine if a bucket is a FLUSH bucket

	 $ret = $bucket-&gtis_flush();

       obj: $bucket ( "APR::Bucket object" )
       ret: $ret ( boolean )
       since: 2.0.00

   "length"
       Get the length of the data in the bucket.

	 $len = $b-&gtlength;

       obj: $b ( "APR::Bucket object" )
       ret: $len ( integer )
	   If the length is unknown, $len value will be -1.

       since: 2.0.00

   "new"
       Create a new bucket and initialize it with data:

	 $nb = APR::Bucket-&gtnew($ba, $data);
	 $nb =		$b-&gtnew($ba, $data);
	 $nb = APR::Bucket-&gtnew($ba, $data, $offset);
	 $nb = APR::Bucket-&gtnew($ba, $data, $offset, $len);

       obj: $b ( "APR::Bucket object or class" )
       arg1: $ba ( "APR::BucketAlloc object" )
       arg2: $data ( string )
	   The data to initialize with.

	   Important: in order to avoid unnecessary data copying the variable
	   is stored in the bucket object. That means that if you modify $data
	   after passing it to "new()" you will modify the data in the bucket
	   as well. To avoid that pass to "new()" a copy which you won't
	   modify.

       opt arg3: $offset ( number )
	   Optional offset inside $data. Default: 0.

       opt arg4: $len ( number )
	   Optional partial length to read.

	   If $offset is specified, then:

	     length $buffer - $offset;

	   will be used. Otherwise the default is to use:

	     length $buffer;

       ret: $nb ( "APR::Bucket object" )
	   a newly created bucket object

       since: 2.0.00

       Examples:

       o   Create a new bucket using a whole string:

	     use APR::Bucket ();
	     my $data = "my data";
	     my $b = APR::Bucket-&gtnew($ba, $data);

	   now the bucket contains the string 'my data'.

       o   Create a new bucket using a sub-string:

	     use APR::Bucket ();
	     my $data	= "my data";
	     my $offset = 3;
	     my $b = APR::Bucket-&gtnew($ba, $data, $offset);

	   now the bucket contains the string 'data'.

       o   Create a new bucket not using the whole length and starting from an
	   offset:

	     use APR::Bucket ();
	     my $data	= "my data";
	     my $offset = 3;
	     my $len	= 3;
	     my $b = APR::Bucket-&gtnew($ba, $data, $offset, $len);

	   now the bucket contains the string 'dat'.

   "read"
       Read the data from the bucket.

	 $len = $b-&gtread($buffer);
	 $len = $b-&gtread($buffer, $block);

       obj: $b ( "APR::Bucket object" )
	   The bucket to read from

       arg1: $buffer ( SCALAR )
	   The buffer to fill. All previous data will be lost.

       opt arg2: $block ( "APR::Const :read_type constant" )
	   optional reading mode constant.

	   By default the read is blocking, via "APR::Const::BLOCK_READ
	   constant".

       ret: $len ( number )
	   How many bytes were actually read

	   $buffer gets populated with the string that is read. It will
	   contain an empty string if there was nothing to read.

       since: 2.0.00
       excpt: "APR::Error"

       It's important to know that certain bucket types (e.g. file bucket),
       may perform a split and insert extra buckets following the current one.
       Therefore never call "$b-&gtremove", before calling "$b-&gtread", or you
       may lose data.

       Examples:

       Blocking read:

	 my $len = $b-&gtread(my $buffer);

       Non-blocking read:

	 use APR::Const -compile 'NONBLOCK_READ';
	 my $len = $b-&gtread(my $buffer, APR::Const::NONBLOCK_READ);

   "remove"
       Tell the bucket to remove itself from the bucket brigade it belongs to.

	 $bucket-&gtremove();

       obj: $bucket ( "APR::Bucket object" )
       ret: no return value
       since: 2.0.00

       If the bucket is not attached to any bucket brigade then this operation
       doesn't do anything.

       When the bucket is removed, it's not not destroyed. Usually this is
       done in order to move the bucket to another bucket brigade. Or to copy
       the data way before destroying the bucket.  If the bucket wasn't moved
       to another bucket brigade it must be destroyed.

       Examples:

       Assuming that $bb1 already exists and filled with buckets, move every
       odd bucket number to $bb2 and every even to $bb3:

	 my $bb2 = APR::Brigade-&gtnew($c-&gtpool, $c-&gtbucket_alloc);
	 my $bb3 = APR::Brigade-&gtnew($c-&gtpool, $c-&gtbucket_alloc);
	 my $count = 0;
	 while (my $bucket = $bb-&gtfirst) {
	     $count++;
	     $bucket-&gtremove;
	     $count % 2
		 ? $bb2-&gtinsert_tail($bucket)
		 : $bb3-&gtinsert_tail($bucket);
	 }

   "setaside"
       Ensure the bucket's data lasts at least as long as the given pool:

	 my $status = $b-&gtsetaside($pool);

       obj: $b ( "APR::Bucket object" )
       arg1: $pool ( "APR::Pool object" )
       ret: ( "APR::Const status constant" )
	   On success, "APR::Const::SUCCESS" is returned. Otherwise a failure
	   code is returned.

       excpt: "APR::Error"
	   when your code deals only with mod_perl buckets, you don't have to
	   ask for the return value. If this method is called in the "VOID"
	   context, i.e.:

	     $b-&gtsetaside($pool);

	   mod_perl will do the error checking on your behalf, and if the
	   return code is not "APR::Const::SUCCESS", an "APR::Error exception"
	   will be thrown.

	   However if your code doesn't know which bucket types it may need to
	   setaside, you may want to check the return code and deal with any
	   errors. For example one of the possible error codes is
	   "APR::Const::ENOTIMPL". As of this writing the pipe and socket
	   buckets can't "setaside()", in which case you may want to look at
	   the "ap_save_brigade()" implementation.

       since: 2.0.00

       Usually setaside is called by certain output filters, in order to
       buffer socket writes of smaller buckets into a single write. This
       method works on all bucket types (not only the mod_perl bucket type),
       but as explained in the exceptions section, not all bucket types
       implement this method.

       When a mod_perl bucket is setaside, its data is detached from the
       original perl scalar and copied into a pool bucket. That allows
       downstream filters to deal with the data originally owned by a Perl
       interpreter, making it possible for that interpreter to go away and do
       other things, or be destroyed.

   "type"
       Get the type of the data in the bucket.

	 $type = $b-&gttype;

       obj: $b ( "APR::Bucket object" )
       ret: $type ( "APR::BucketType object" )
       since: 2.0.00

       You need to invoke "APR::BucketType" methods to access the data.

       Example:

       Create a flush bucket and read its type's name:

	 use APR::Bucket ();
	 use APR::BucketType ();
	 my $b = APR::Bucket::flush_create($ba);
	 my $type = $b-&gttype;
	 my $type_name =  $type-&gtname; # FLUSH

       The type name will be 'FLUSH' in this example.

Unsupported API
       "APR::Socket" also provides auto-generated Perl interface for a few
       other methods which aren't tested at the moment and therefore their API
       is a subject to change. These methods will be finalized later as a need
       arises. If you want to rely on any of the following methods please
       contact the the mod_perl development mailing list so we can help each
       other take the steps necessary to shift the method to an officially
       supported API.

   "data"
	 $data = $b-&gtdata;

       Gives a C pointer to the address of the data in the bucket. I can't see
       what use can be done of it in Perl.

       obj: $b ( "APR::Bucket object" )
       ret: $data ( C pointer )
       since: subject to change

   "start"
	 $start = $b-&gtstart;

       It gives the offset to when a new bucket is created with a non-zero
       offset value:

	 my $b = APR::Bucket-&gtnew($ba, $data, $offset, $len);

       So if the offset was 3. $start will be 3 too.

       I fail to see what it can be useful for to the end user (it's mainly
       used internally).

       obj: $b ( "APR::Bucket object" )
       ret: $start ( offset number )
       since: subject to change
