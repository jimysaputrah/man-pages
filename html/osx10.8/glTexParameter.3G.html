C SPECIFICATION
       void glTexParameterfv(GLenum target, GLenum pname,
			     const GLfloat * params);

       void glTexParameteriv(GLenum target, GLenum pname,
			     const GLint * params);

			      const GLint * params);

       void glTexParameterIuiv(GLenum target, GLenum pname,
			       const GLuint * params);

PARAMETERS
       target
	   Specifies the target texture, which must be either GL_TEXTURE_1D,
	   GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_3D, GL_TEXTURE_1D_ARRAY,
	   GL_TEXTURE_2D_ARRAY, GL_TEXTURE_RECTANGLE, or GL_TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP.

       pname
	   Specifies the symbolic name of a texture parameter.	pname can be
	   one of the following: GL_TEXTURE_BASE_LEVEL,
	   GL_TEXTURE_BORDER_COLOR, GL_TEXTURE_COMPARE_FUNC,
	   GL_TEXTURE_COMPARE_MODE, GL_TEXTURE_LOD_BIAS,

	   GL_TEXTURE_SWIZZLE_RGBA, GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_S, GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_T, or
	   GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_R.

       params
	   Specifies a pointer to an array where the value or values of pname
	   are stored.

DESCRIPTION
       glTexParameter assigns the value or values in params to the texture
       parameter specified as pname.  target defines the target texture,
       either GL_TEXTURE_1D, GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_1D_ARRAY,
       GL_TEXTURE_2D_ARRAY, GL_TEXTURE_RECTANGLE, or GL_TEXTURE_3D. The
       following symbols are accepted in pname:

       GL_TEXTURE_BASE_LEVEL
	   Specifies the index of the lowest defined mipmap level. This is an
	   integer value. The initial value is 0.


       GL_TEXTURE_BORDER_COLOR
	   The data in params specifies four values that define the border
	   values that should be used for border texels. If a texel is sampled
	   from the border of the texture, the values of
	   GL_TEXTURE_BORDER_COLOR are interpreted as an RGBA color to match
	   the texture's internal format and substituted for the non-existent
	   texel data. If the texture contains depth components, the first
	   component of GL_TEXTURE_BORDER_COLOR is interpreted as a depth
	   value. The initial value is 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0.

	   If the values for GL_TEXTURE_BORDER_COLOR are specified with
	   glTexParameterIiv or glTexParameterIuiv, the values are stored
	   unmodified with an internal data type of integer. If specified with
	   glTexParameteriv, they are converted to floating point with the
	   following equation: f = 2 c + 1 2 b - 1. If specified with
	   glTexParameterfv, they are stored unmodified as floating-point
	   values.

       GL_TEXTURE_COMPARE_FUNC
	   Specifies the comparison operator used when GL_TEXTURE_COMPARE_MODE
	   is set to GL_COMPARE_REF_TO_TEXTURE. Permissible values are:

	   where r is the current interpolated texture coordinate, and D t is
	   the depth texture value sampled from the currently bound depth
	   texture.  result is assigned to the the red channel.

       GL_TEXTURE_COMPARE_MODE
	   Specifies the texture comparison mode for currently bound depth
	   textures. That is, a texture whose internal format is
	   GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT_*; see glTexImage2D()) Permissible values are:

	   GL_COMPARE_REF_TO_TEXTURE
	       Specifies that the interpolated and clamped r texture
	       coordinate should be compared to the value in the currently
	       bound depth texture. See the discussion of
	       GL_TEXTURE_COMPARE_FUNC for details of how the comparison is
	       evaluated. The result of the comparison is assigned to the red
	       channel.

	   GL_NONE
	       Specifies that the red channel should be assigned the
	       appropriate value from the currently bound depth texture.


       GL_TEXTURE_LOD_BIAS

	   params specifies a fixed bias value that is to be added to the
	   level-of-detail parameter for the texture before texture sampling.
	   The specified value is added to the shader-supplied bias value (if
	   any) and subsequently clamped into the implementation-defined range
	   - bias max bias max, where bias max is the value of the
	   implementation defined constant GL_MAX_TEXTURE_LOD_BIAS. The
	   initial value is 0.0.

       GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER
	   The texture minifying function is used whenever the level-of-detail
	   function used when sampling from the texture determines that the
	   texture should be minified. There are six defined minifying
	   functions. Two of them use either the nearest texture elements or a
	   weighted average of multiple texture elements to compute the
	   texture value. The other four use mipmaps.

	   A mipmap is an ordered set of arrays representing the same image at
	   progressively lower resolutions. If the texture has dimensions 2 n
	   x 2 m, there are max ai n m + 1 mipmaps. The first mipmap is the
	   original texture, with dimensions 2 n x 2 m. Each subsequent mipmap
	   has dimensions 2 k - 1 x 2 l - 1, where 2 k x 2 l are the
	   dimensions of the previous mipmap, until either k = 0 or l = 0. At
	   that point, subsequent mipmaps have dimension 1 x 2 l - 1 or 2 k -
	   1 x 1 until the final mipmap, which has dimension 1 x 1. To define
	   the mipmaps, call glTexImage1D(), glTexImage2D(), glTexImage3D(),
	   glCopyTexImage1D(), or glCopyTexImage2D() with the level argument
	   indicating the order of the mipmaps. Level 0 is the original
	   texture; level max ai n m is the final 1 x 1 mipmap.


	   params supplies a function for minifying the texture as one of the
	   following:

	   GL_NEAREST
	       Returns the value of the texture element that is nearest (in
	       Manhattan distance) to the specified texture coordinates.

	   GL_LINEAR
	       Returns the weighted average of the four texture elements that
	       are closest to the specified texture coordinates. These can
	       include items wrapped or repeated from other parts of a
	       texture, depending on the values of GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_S and
	       GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_T, and on the exact mapping.

	   GL_NEAREST_MIPMAP_NEAREST
	       Chooses the mipmap that most closely matches the size of the
	       pixel being textured and uses the GL_NEAREST criterion (the
	       texture element closest to the specified texture coordinates)
	       to produce a texture value.

	   GL_LINEAR_MIPMAP_NEAREST
	       Chooses the mipmap that most closely matches the size of the
	       pixel being textured and uses the GL_LINEAR criterion (a
	       weighted average of the four texture elements that are closest
	       to the specified texture coordinates) to produce a texture
	       value.

	   GL_NEAREST_MIPMAP_LINEAR
	       Chooses the two mipmaps that most closely match the size of the
	       pixel being textured and uses the GL_NEAREST criterion (the
	       texture element closest to the specified texture coordinates )
	       to produce a texture value from each mipmap. The final texture
	       value is a weighted average of those two values.

	   GL_LINEAR_MIPMAP_LINEAR
	       Chooses the two mipmaps that most closely match the size of the
	       pixel being textured and uses the GL_LINEAR criterion (a
	       weighted average of the texture elements that are closest to
	       the specified texture coordinates) to produce a texture value
	       from each mipmap. The final texture value is a weighted average
	       of those two values.

	   As more texture elements are sampled in the minification process,
	   fewer aliasing artifacts will be apparent. While the GL_NEAREST and
	   GL_LINEAR minification functions can be faster than the other four,
	   they sample only one or multiple texture elements to determine the
	   texture value of the pixel being rendered and can produce moire
	   patterns or ragged transitions. The initial value of
	   GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER is GL_NEAREST_MIPMAP_LINEAR.


       GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER
	   The texture magnification function is used whenever the
	   level-of-detail function used when sampling from the texture
	   determines that the texture should be magified. It sets the texture
	   magnification function to either GL_NEAREST or GL_LINEAR (see
	   below).  GL_NEAREST is generally faster than GL_LINEAR, but it can
	   produce textured images with sharper edges because the transition
	   between texture elements is not as smooth. The initial value of
	   GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER is GL_LINEAR.

	   GL_NEAREST
	       Returns the value of the texture element that is nearest (in
	       Manhattan distance) to the specified texture coordinates.

	   GL_LINEAR
	       Returns the weighted average of the texture elements that are
	       closest to the specified texture coordinates. These can include
	       items wrapped or repeated from other parts of a texture,
	       depending on the values of GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_S and
	       GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_T, and on the exact mapping.




       GL_TEXTURE_MIN_LOD
	   Sets the minimum level-of-detail parameter. This floating-point
	   value limits the selection of highest resolution mipmap (lowest
	   mipmap level). The initial value is -1000.


       GL_TEXTURE_MAX_LOD
	   Sets the maximum level-of-detail parameter. This floating-point
	   value limits the selection of the lowest resolution mipmap (highest
	   mipmap level). The initial value is 1000.


       GL_TEXTURE_MAX_LEVEL
	   Sets the index of the highest defined mipmap level. This is an
	   integer value. The initial value is 1000.


       GL_TEXTURE_SWIZZLE_R
	   Sets the swizzle that will be applied to the r component of a texel
	   before it is returned to the shader. Valid values for param are
	   GL_RED, GL_GREEN, GL_BLUE, GL_ALPHA, GL_ZERO and GL_ONE. If
	   GL_TEXTURE_SWIZZLE_R is GL_RED, the value for r will be taken from
	   the first channel of the fetched texel. If GL_TEXTURE_SWIZZLE_R is
	   GL_GREEN, the value for r will be taken from the second channel of
	   the fetched texel. If GL_TEXTURE_SWIZZLE_R is GL_BLUE, the value
	   for r will be taken from the third channel of the fetched texel. If
	   GL_TEXTURE_SWIZZLE_R is GL_ALPHA, the value for r will be taken
	   from the fourth channel of the fetched texel. If
	   GL_TEXTURE_SWIZZLE_R is GL_ZERO, the value for r will be subtituted
	   with 0.0. If GL_TEXTURE_SWIZZLE_R is GL_ONE, the value for r will
	   be subtituted with 1.0. The initial value is GL_RED.


       GL_TEXTURE_SWIZZLE_G
	   Sets the swizzle that will be applied to the g component of a texel
	   before it is returned to the shader. Valid values for param and
	   their effects are similar to those of GL_TEXTURE_SWIZZLE_R. The
	   initial value is GL_GREEN.


       GL_TEXTURE_SWIZZLE_B
	   Sets the swizzle that will be applied to the b component of a texel
	   before it is returned to the shader. Valid values for param and
	   their effects are similar to those of GL_TEXTURE_SWIZZLE_R. The
	   initial value is GL_BLUE.


       GL_TEXTURE_SWIZZLE_A
	   Sets the swizzle that will be applied to the a component of a texel
	   before it is returned to the shader. Valid values for param and
	   their effects are similar to those of GL_TEXTURE_SWIZZLE_R. The
	   initial value is GL_ALPHA.


       GL_TEXTURE_SWIZZLE_RGBA
	   Sets the swizzles that will be applied to the r, g, b, and a
	   components of a texel before they are returned to the shader. Valid
	   values for params and their effects are similar to those of
	   GL_TEXTURE_SWIZZLE_R, except that all channels are specified
	   simultaneously. Setting the value of GL_TEXTURE_SWIZZLE_RGBA is
	   equivalent (assuming no errors are generated) to setting the
	   parameters of each of GL_TEXTURE_SWIZZLE_R, GL_TEXTURE_SWIZZLE_G,
	   GL_TEXTURE_SWIZZLE_B, and GL_TEXTURE_SWIZZLE_A successively.


       GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_S
	   Sets the wrap parameter for texture coordinate s to either
	   GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE, GL_CLAMP_TO_BORDER, GL_MIRRORED_REPEAT, or
	   GL_REPEAT.  GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE causes s coordinates to be clamped to
	   the range 1 2N 1 - 1 2N, where N is the size of the texture in the
	   direction of clamping.  GL_CLAMP_TO_BORDER evaluates s coordinates
	   in a similar manner to GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE. However, in cases where
	   clamping would have occurred in GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE mode, the fetched
	   texel data is substituted with the values specified by
	   GL_TEXTURE_BORDER_COLOR.  GL_REPEAT causes the integer part of the
	   s coordinate to be ignored; the GL uses only the fractional part,
	   thereby creating a repeating pattern.  GL_MIRRORED_REPEAT causes
	   the s coordinate to be set to the fractional part of the texture
	   coordinate if the integer part of s is even; if the integer part of
	   s is odd, then the s texture coordinate is set to 1 - frac ai s,
	   where frac ai s represents the fractional part of s. Initially,
	   GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_S is set to GL_REPEAT.


       GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_T
	   Sets the wrap parameter for texture coordinate t to either
	   GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE, GL_CLAMP_TO_BORDER, GL_MIRRORED_REPEAT, or
	   GL_REPEAT. See the discussion under GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_S. Initially,
	   GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_T is set to GL_REPEAT.


       GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_R
	   Sets the wrap parameter for texture coordinate r to either
	   GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE, GL_CLAMP_TO_BORDER, GL_MIRRORED_REPEAT, or
	   GL_REPEAT. See the discussion under GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_S. Initially,
	   GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_R is set to GL_REPEAT.

NOTES
       Suppose that a program attempts to sample from a texture and has set
       GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER to one of the functions that requires a mipmap.
       If either the dimensions of the texture images currently defined (with
       previous calls to glTexImage1D(), glTexImage2D(), glTexImage3D(),
       glCopyTexImage1D(), or glCopyTexImage2D()) do not follow the proper
       sequence for mipmaps (described above), or there are fewer texture
       images defined than are needed, or the set of texture images have
       differing numbers of texture components, then the texture is considered
       incomplete.

       Linear filtering accesses the four nearest texture elements only in 2D
       textures. In 1D textures, linear filtering accesses the two nearest
       texture elements. In 3D textures, linear filtering accesses the eight
       nearest texture elements.


       glTexParameter specifies the texture parameters for the active texture
       unit, specified by calling glActiveTexture().

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if target or pname is not one of the
       accepted defined values.


       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if params should have a defined constant
       value (based on the value of pname) and does not.
