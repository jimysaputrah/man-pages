NAME
       glBindBufferRange - bind a range within a buffer object to an indexed
       buffer target

C SPECIFICATION
       void glBindBufferRange(GLenumtarget, GLuintindex, GLuintbuffer,
			      GLintptroffset, GLsizeiptrsize);

PARAMETERS
       target
	   Specify the target of the bind operation.  target must be either
	   GL_TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_BUFFER or GL_UNIFORM_BUFFER.

       index
	   Specify the index of the binding point within the array specified
	   by target.

       buffer
	   The name of a buffer object to bind to the specified binding point.

       offset
	   The starting offset in basic machine units into the buffer object
	   buffer.

       size
	   The amount of data in machine units that can be read from the
	   buffet object while used as an indexed target.

DESCRIPTION
       glBindBufferRange binds a range the buffer object buffer represented by
       offset and size to the binding point at index index of the array of
       targets specified by target. Each target represents an indexed array of
       buffer binding points, as well as a single general binding point that
       can be used by other buffer manipulation functions such as
       glBindBuffer() or glMapBuffer(). In addition to binding a range of
       buffer to the indexed buffer binding target, glBindBufferBase also
       binds the range to the generic buffer binding point specified by
       target.


       offset specifies the offset in basic machine units into the buffer
       object buffer and size specifies the amount of data that can be read
       from the buffer object while used as an indexed target.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if target is not
       GL_TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_BUFFER or GL_UNIFORM_BUFFER.


       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if index is greater than or equal to the
       number of target-specific indexed binding points.


       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if size is less than or equal to zero, or
       if offset + size is greater than the value of GL_BUFFER_SIZE.

       Additional errors may be generated if offset violates any
       target-specific alignmemt restrictions.
