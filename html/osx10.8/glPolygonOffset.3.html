NAME
       glPolygonOffset	- set the scale and units used to calculate depth val-
       ues


C SPECIFICATION
       void glPolygonOffset( GLfloat factor,
			     GLfloat units )


PARAMETERS
       factor  Specifies a scale factor that is  used  to  create  a  variable
	       depth offset for each polygon. The initial value is 0.

       units   Is  multiplied  by an implementation-specific value to create a
	       constant depth offset. The initial value is 0.

DESCRIPTION
       When	 GL_POLYGON_OFFSET_FILL,      GL_POLYGON_OFFSET_LINE,	    or
       GL_POLYGON_OFFSET_POINT is enabled, each fragment's depth value will be
       offset after it is interpolated from the depth values of the  appropri-
       ate vertices.  The value of the offset is factor*DZ + r*units, where DZ
       is a measurement of the change in depth relative to the screen area  of
       the  polygon, and r is the smallest value that is guaranteed to produce
       a resolvable offset for a given implementation.	The  offset  is  added
       before the depth test is performed and before the value is written into
       the depth buffer.

       glPolygonOffset is useful for rendering hidden-line images, for	apply-
       ing  decals  to	surfaces,  and	for  rendering solids with highlighted
       edges.

NOTES
       glPolygonOffset is available only if the GL version is 1.1 or  greater.

       glPolygonOffset	has no effect on depth coordinates placed in the feed-
       back buffer.

       glPolygonOffset has no effect on selection.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_OPERATION  is  generated  if	glPolygonOffset  is   executed
       between	the  execution	of  glBegin and the corresponding execution of
       glEnd.

ASSOCIATED GETS
       glIsEnabled	  with	      argument	       GL_POLYGON_OFFSET_FILL,
       GL_POLYGON_OFFSET_LINE, or GL_POLYGON_OFFSET_POINT.

       glGet	   with       argument	     GL_POLYGON_OFFSET_FACTOR	    or
       GL_POLYGON_OFFSET_UNITS.
