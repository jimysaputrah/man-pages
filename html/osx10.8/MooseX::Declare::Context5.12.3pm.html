MooseX::Declare::ConteUser)Contributed Perl DocumenMooseX::Declare::Context(3)



NAME
       MooseX::Declare::Context - Per-keyword declaration context

DESCRIPTION
       This is not a subclass of Devel::Declare::Context::Simple, but it will
       delegate all default methods and extend it with some attributes and
       methods of its own.

       A context object will be instanciated for every keyword that is handled
       by MooseX::Declare. If handlers want to communicate with other handlers
       (for example handlers that will only be setup inside a namespace block)
       it must do this via the generated code.

       In addition to all the methods documented here, all methods from
       Devel::Declare::Context::Simple are available and will be delegated to
       an internally stored instance of it.

ATTRIBUTES
   caller_file
       A required "Str" containing the file the keyword was encountered in.

   preamble_code_parts
       An "ArrayRef" of "CodePart"s that will be used as preamble. A preamble
       in this context means the beginning of the generated code.

   scope_code_parts
       These parts will come before the actual body and after the
       "preamble_code_parts". It is an "ArrayRef" of "CodePart"s.

   cleanup_code_parts
       An "ArrayRef" of "CodePart"s that will not be directly inserted into
       the code, but instead be installed in a handler that will run at the
       end of the scope so you can do namespace cleanups and such.

   stack
       An "ArrayRef" that contains the stack of handlers. A keyword that was
       only setup inside a scoped block will have the blockhandler be put in
       the stack.

METHODS
   add_preamble_code_parts(CodePart @parts)
	 Object-&gtadd_preamble_code_parts (CodeRef @parts)

       See "add_cleanup_code_parts".

   add_scope_code_parts(CodePart @parts)
	 Object-&gtadd_scope_code_parts	 (CodeRef @parts)

       See "add_cleanup_code_parts".

   add_cleanup_code_parts(CodePart @parts)
	 Object-&gtadd_cleanup_code_parts  (CodeRef @parts)

       For these three methods please look at the corresponding *_code_parts
       attribute in the list above. These methods are merely convenience
       methods that allow adding entries to the code part containers.

   inject_code_parts_here
	 True Object-&gtinject_code_parts_here (CodePart @parts)

       Will inject the passed "CodePart"s at the current position in the code.

   peek_next_char
	 Str Object-&gtpeek_next_char ()

       Will return the next char without stripping it from the stream.

   inject_code_parts
	 Object-&gtinject_code_parts (
	     Bool    :$inject_cleanup_code_parts,
	     CodeRef :$missing_block_handler
	 )

       This will inject the code parts from the attributes above at the
       current position. The preamble and scope code parts will be inserted
       first. Then then call to the cleanup code will be injected, unless the
       options contain a key named "inject_cleanup_code_parts" with a false
       value.

       The "inject_if_block" method will be called if the next char is a "{"
       indicating a following block.

       If it is not a block, but a semi-colon is found and the options
       contained a "missing_block_handler" key was passed, it will be called
       as method on the context object with the code to inject and the options
       as arguments. All options that are not recognized are passed through to
       the "missing_block_handler". You are well advised to prefix option
       names in your extensions.

TYPES
   BlockCodePart
       An "ArrayRef" with at least one element that stringifies to either
       "BEGIN" or "END". The other parts will be stringified and used as the
       body for the generated block. An example would be this compiletime role
       composition:

	 ['BEGIN', 'with q{ MyRole }']

   CodePart
       A part of code represented by either a "Str" or a "BlockCodePart".
