NAME
       Tk_OwnSelection - make a window the owner of the primary selection

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lttk.h&gt

       Tk_OwnSelection(tkwin, selection, proc, clientData)

ARGUMENTS
       Tk_Window tkwin (in)		       Window  that  is  to become new
					       selection owner.

       Atom selection (in)		       The name of the selection to be
					       owned, such as XA_PRIMARY.

       Tk_LostSelProc *proc (in)	       Procedure  to invoke when tkwin
					       loses	selection    ownership

DESCRIPTION
       Tk_OwnSelection arranges for tkwin to  become  the  new	owner  of  the
       selection  specified by the atom selection.  After this call completes,
       future requests for the selection will be directed to handlers  created
       for  tkwin  using Tk_CreateSelHandler.  When tkwin eventually loses the
       selection ownership, proc will be invoked so that the window can  clean
       itself  up  (e.g.  by  unhighlighting the selection).  Proc should have
       arguments and result that match the type Tk_LostSelProc:
	      typedef void Tk_LostSelProc(ClientData clientData);
       The clientData parameter to proc is a copy of the  clientData  argument
       given  to Tk_OwnSelection, and is usually a pointer to a data structure
       containing application-specific information about tkwin.
