NAME
       glPolygonMode - select a polygon rasterization mode

C SPECIFICATION
       void glPolygonMode(GLenum face, GLenum mode);

PARAMETERS
       face
	   Specifies the polygons that mode applies to. Must be
	   GL_FRONT_AND_BACK for front- and back-facing polygons.

       mode
	   Specifies how polygons will be rasterized. Accepted values are
	   GL_POINT, GL_LINE, and GL_FILL. The initial value is GL_FILL for
	   both front- and back-facing polygons.

DESCRIPTION
       glPolygonMode controls the interpretation of polygons for
       rasterization.  face describes which polygons mode applies to: both
       front and back-facing polygons (GL_FRONT_AND_BACK). The polygon mode
       affects only the final rasterization of polygons. In particular, a
       polygon's vertices are lit and the polygon is clipped and possibly
       culled before these modes are applied.

       Three modes are defined and can be specified in mode:

       GL_POINT
	   Polygon vertices that are marked as the start of a boundary edge
	   are drawn as points. Point attributes such as GL_POINT_SIZE and
	   GL_POINT_SMOOTH control the rasterization of the points. Polygon
	   rasterization attributes other than GL_POLYGON_MODE have no effect.

       GL_LINE
	   Boundary edges of the polygon are drawn as line segments. Line
	   attributes such as GL_LINE_WIDTH and GL_LINE_SMOOTH control the
	   rasterization of the lines. Polygon rasterization attributes other
	   than GL_POLYGON_MODE have no effect.

       GL_FILL
	   The interior of the polygon is filled. Polygon attributes such as
	   GL_POLYGON_SMOOTH control the rasterization of the polygon.

EXAMPLES
       To draw a surface with outlined polygons, call

	   glPolygonMode(GL_FRONT_AND_BACK, GL_LINE);



NOTES
       Vertices are marked as boundary or nonboundary with an edge flag. Edge
       flags are generated internally by the GL when it decomposes triangle
       stips and fans.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if either face or mode is not an accepted
       value.

ASSOCIATED GETS
       glGet() with argument GL_POLYGON_MODE
