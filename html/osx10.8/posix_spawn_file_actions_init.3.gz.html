POSIX_SPAWN_FILE_ACTI... BSD Library Functions Manual POSIX_SPAWN_FILE_ACTI...

NAME
     posix_spawn_file_actions_init posix_spawn_file_actions_destroy -- ini-
     tialize or destroy spawn file actions objects

SYNOPSIS
     #include &ltspawn.h&gt

     int
     posix_spawn_file_actions_init(posix_spawn_file_actions_t *file_actions);

     int
     posix_spawn_file_actions_destroy(posix_spawn_file_actions_t *file_actions);

DESCRIPTION
     The posix_spawn_file_actions_init() function initializes the object ref-
     erenced by file_actions, to an empty set of file actions for subsequent
     use in a call to posix_spawn(2) or posix_spawnp(2).  A
     posix_spawn_file_actions_t object is an opaque type that is used to col-
     lect set of file actions specified by calls to
     posix_spawn_file_actions_addclose(3) and
     posix_spawn_file_actions_addopen(3) such that once the spawn operation is
     complete, the child process will have a different set of file descriptors
     than the parent, in the order that the operations were added to the
     posix_spawn_file_actions_t.

     Additionally, any descriptor in the parent not modified by a file action,
     and which has the FD_CLOEXEC flag set, will be closed in the child.

     The posix_spawn_file_actions_destroy() function destroys the object ref-
     erenced by file_actions which was previously intialized by
     posix_spawn_file_actions_init(), returning any resources obtained at the
     time of initialization to the system for subsequent reuse.  A
     posix_spawn_file_actions_t may be reinitialized after having been
     destroyed, but must not be reused after destruction, unless it has been
     reinitialized.

RETURN VALUES
     On success, these functions return 0; on failure they return an error
     number from &lterrno.h&gt.

ERRORS
     These functions will fail and return an error if:

     [ENOMEM]		Insufficient resources to initialize the
			posix_spawn_file_actions_t object.

     [EINVAL]		The posix_spawn_file_actions_t being destroyed is
			invalid.

STANDARDS
     Version 3 of the Single UNIX Specification (``SUSv3'') [SPN]

     The posix_spawn_file_actions_init() and
     posix_spawn_file_actions_destroy() function calls appeared in Version 3
