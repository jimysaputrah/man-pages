DESCRIPTION
       glPixelTransfer	sets pixel transfer modes that affect the operation of
       subsequent    glCopyPixels,     glCopyTexImage1D,     glCopyTexImage2D,
       glCopyTexSubImage1D,	 glCopyTexSubImage2D,	  glCopyTexSubImage3D,
       glDrawPixels, glReadPixels, glTexImage1D,  glTexImage2D,  glTexImage3D,
       glTexSubImage1D,  glTexSubImage2D, and glTexSubImage3D commands.  Addi-
       tionally, if the  GL_ARB_imaging  subset  is  supported,  the  routines
       glColorTable,	      glColorSubTable,		glConvolutionFilter1D,
       glConvolutionFilter2D, glHistogram, glMinmax,  and  glSeparableFilter2D
       are also affected.  The algorithms that are specified by pixel transfer
       modes operate on pixels after they are read from the  frame  buffer  (-
       glCopyPixels  glCopyTexImage1D,	glCopyTexImage2D, glCopyTexSubImage1D,
       glCopyTexSubImage2D,   glCopyTexSubImage3D,   and   glReadPixels),   or
       unpacked  from client memory (glDrawPixels, glTexImage1D, glTexImage2D,
       glTexImage3D, glTexSubImage1D, glTexSubImage2D,	and  glTexSubImage3D).
       Pixel  transfer	operations  happen  in the same order, and in the same
       manner, regardless of the command that resulted in the pixel operation.
       Pixel  storage modes (see glPixelStore) control the unpacking of pixels
       being read from client memory, and the packing of pixels being  written
       back into client memory.

       Pixel  transfer	operations handle four fundamental pixel types: color,
       color index, depth, and stencil.  Color pixels consist of  four	float-
       ing-point  values  with unspecified mantissa and exponent sizes, scaled
       such that 0 represents zero intensity and 1 represents full  intensity.
       Color  indices  comprise  a  single fixed-point value, with unspecified
       precision to the right of the binary point.  Depth  pixels  comprise  a
       single  floating-point  value,  with  unspecified mantissa and exponent
       sizes, scaled such that 0.0 represents the minimum depth buffer	value,
       and  1.0  represents  the maximum depth buffer value.  Finally, stencil
       pixels comprise a single fixed-point value, with unspecified  precision
       to the right of the binary point.

       The  pixel  transfer operations performed on the four basic pixel types
       are as follows:

       Color	   Each of the four color components is multiplied by a  scale
		   factor, then added to a bias factor.  That is, the red com-
		   ponent  is  multiplied  by  GL_RED_SCALE,  then  added   to
		   GL_RED_BIAS;   the	green	component   is	multiplied  by
		   GL_GREEN_SCALE, then added to GL_GREEN_BIAS; the blue  com-
		   ponent  is  multiplied  by  GL_BLUE_SCALE,  then  added  to
		   GL_BLUE_BIAS; and the  alpha  component  is	multiplied  by
		   GL_ALPHA_SCALE,  then  added  to  GL_ALPHA_BIAS.  After all
		   four color  components  are	scaled	and  biased,  each  is
		   clamped  to	the  range  [0,1].  All color, scale, and bias
		   values are specified with glPixelTransfer.

		   If GL_MAP_COLOR is true, each color component is scaled  by
		   the	size  of  the  corresponding  color-to-color map, then
		   replaced by the contents of that map indexed by the	scaled
		   component.	That  is,  the	red  component	is  scaled  by
		   GL_PIXEL_MAP_R_TO_R_SIZE, then replaced by the contents  of
		   GL_PIXEL_MAP_R_TO_R indexed by itself.  The green component
		   is scaled by GL_PIXEL_MAP_G_TO_G_SIZE, then replaced by the
		   contents  of  GL_PIXEL_MAP_G_TO_G  indexed  by itself.  The
		   blue component is scaled by GL_PIXEL_MAP_B_TO_B_SIZE,  then
		   replaced  by the contents of GL_PIXEL_MAP_B_TO_B indexed by
		   itself.    And   the   alpha   component   is   scaled   by
		   GL_PIXEL_MAP_A_TO_A_SIZE,  then replaced by the contents of
		   GL_PIXEL_MAP_A_TO_A	indexed  by  itself.   All  components
		   taken  from	the  maps are then clamped to the range [0,1].
		   GL_MAP_COLOR is specified with glPixelTransfer.   The  con-
		   tents of the various maps are specified with glPixelMap.

		   If  the  GL_ARB_imaging extension is supported, each of the
		   four color components may be scaled and biased after  tran-
		   formation  by the color matrix.  That is, the red component
		   is multiplied by GL_POST_COLOR_MATRIX_RED_SCALE, then added
		   to  GL_POST_COLOR_MATRIX_RED_BIAS;  the  green component is
		   multiplied by GL_POST_COLOR_MATRIX_GREEN_SCALE, then  added
		   to  GL_POST_COLOR_MATRIX_GREEN_BIAS;  the blue component is
		   multiplied by GL_POST_COLOR_MATRIX_BLUE_SCALE,  then  added
		   to  GL_POST_COLOR_MATRIX_BLUE_BIAS; and the alpha component
		   is  multiplied  by  GL_POST_COLOR_MATRIX_ALPHA_SCALE,  then
		   added  to  GL_POST_COLOR_MATRIX_ALPHA_BIAS.	After all four
		   color components are scaled and biased, each is clamped  to
		   the range [0,1].

		   Similiarly,	if  the GL_ARB_imaging extension is supported,
		   each of the four color components may be scaled and	biased
		   after  processing  by the enabled convolution filter.  That
		   is,	  the	 red	component     is     multiplied     by
		   GL_POST_CONVOLUTION_RED_SCALE,      then	 added	    to
		   GL_POST_CONVOLUTION_RED_BIAS; the green component is multi-
		   plied  by  GL_POST_CONVOLUTION_GREEN_SCALE,	then  added to
		   GL_POST_CONVOLUTION_GREEN_BIAS; the blue component is  mul-
		   tiplied  by	GL_POST_CONVOLUTION_BLUE_SCALE,  then added to
		   GL_POST_CONVOLUTION_BLUE_BIAS; and the alpha  component  is
		   multiplied  by  GL_POST_CONVOLUTION_ALPHA_SCALE, then added
		   to GL_POST_CONVOLUTION_ALPHA_BIAS.  After  all  four  color
		   components  are  scaled  and biased, each is clamped to the
		   range [0,1].

       Color index Each color index is shifted left  by  GL_INDEX_SHIFT  bits;
		   any	bits beyond the number of fraction bits carried by the
		   fixed-point index are filled with zeros.  If GL_INDEX_SHIFT
		   is  negative, the shift is to the right, again zero filled.
		   Then GL_INDEX_OFFSET is added to the index.	GL_INDEX_SHIFT
		   and GL_INDEX_OFFSET are specified with
		   glPixelTransfer.

		   From  this  point,  operation  diverges  depending  on  the
		   required  of the resulting pixels.  If the resulting pixels
		   are	to  be written to a color index buffer, or if they are
		   being read back to client memory in	GL_COLOR_INDEX	,  the
		   pixels  continue to be treated as indices.  If GL_MAP_COLOR
		   is true, each index	is  masked  by	(2^n)-1,  where  n  is
		   GL_PIXEL_MAP_I_TO_I_SIZE,  then replaced by the contents of
		   GL_PIXEL_MAP_I_TO_I	 indexed   by	the   masked	value.
		   GL_MAP_COLOR  is  specified with glPixelTransfer.  The con-
		   tents of the index map is specified with glPixelMap.

		   If the resulting pixels are to be written to an RGBA  color
		   buffer,  or	if  they  are  read back to client memory in a
		   other than GL_COLOR_INDEX, the pixels  are  converted  from
		   indices   to   colors   by	referencing   the   four  maps
		   GL_PIXEL_MAP_I_TO_R, 		  GL_PIXEL_MAP_I_TO_G,
		   GL_PIXEL_MAP_I_TO_B, and GL_PIXEL_MAP_I_TO_A.  Before being
		   dereferenced, the index is masked by (2^n)-1,  where  n  is
		   GL_PIXEL_MAP_I_TO_R_SIZE	 for	  the	  red	  map,
		   GL_PIXEL_MAP_I_TO_G_SIZE	for	the	green	  map,
		   GL_PIXEL_MAP_I_TO_B_SIZE    for    the    blue   map,   and
		   GL_PIXEL_MAP_I_TO_A_SIZE for the alpha map.	All components
		   taken  from	the  maps are then clamped to the range [0,1].
		   The contents of the four maps is specified with glPixelMap.

       Depth	   Each  depth value is multiplied by GL_DEPTH_SCALE, added to
		   GL_DEPTH_BIAS, then clamped to the range [0,1].

       Stencil	   Each index is shifted GL_INDEX_SHIFT bits just as  a  color
		   index is, then added to GL_INDEX_OFFSET.  If GL_MAP_STENCIL
		   is true, each index	is  masked  by	(2^n)-1,  where  n  is
		   GL_PIXEL_MAP_S_TO_S_SIZE,  then replaced by the contents of
		   GL_PIXEL_MAP_S_TO_S indexed by the masked value.

       glPixelTransferf can be used to set any pixel transfer  parameter.   If
       the  parameter  type  is  boolean,  0 implies false and any other value
       implies true.  If pname is an integer parameter, param  is  rounded  to
       the nearest integer.

       Likewise, glPixelTransferi can be used to set any of the pixel transfer
       parameters.  Boolean parameters are set to false if param is 0  and  to
       true  otherwise.   param  is  converted	to floating point before being
       assigned to real-valued parameters.

       list (see glNewList and glCallList), the pixel transfer	mode  settings
       in effect when the display list is executed are the ones that are used.
       They may be different from the settings when the command  was  compiled
       into the display list.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if pname is not an accepted value.

       GL_INVALID_OPERATION   is  generated  if  glPixelTransfer  is  executed
       between the execution of glBegin and  the  corresponding  execution  of
       glEnd.
