NAME
       glutSetWindowTitle,  glutSetIconTitle - change the window or icon title
       respectively of the current top-level window.

SYNTAX
       #include <GLUT/glut.h>

       void glutSetWindowTitle(char *name);
       void glutSetIconTitle(char *name);

ARGUMENTS
       name	 ASCII character string for the window or icon name to be  set
		 for the window.

DESCRIPTION
       These  routines should be called only when the current window is a top-
       level window. Upon creation of a top-level window, the window and  icon
       names  are  determined  by the name parameter to glutCreateWindow. Once
       created, glutSetWindowTitle and glutSetIconTitle can change the	window
       and  icon  names  respectively of top-level windows. Each call requests
       the window system change the  title  appropriately.  Requests  are  not
       buffered or coalesced. The policy by which the window and icon name are
       displayed is window system dependent.
