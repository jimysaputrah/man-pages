NAME
       Moose::Cookbook::Snack::Keywords - Restricted "keywords" in Moose

DESCRIPTION
       Moose exports a number of sugar functions in order to emulate Perl
       built-in keywords. These can cause clashes with other user-defined
       functions. This document provides a list of those keywords for easy
       reference.

   The 'meta' keyword
       While most collisions can be avoided, you cannot avoid importing a
       "meta" method when you "use Moose". If you try to override or change
       what "meta" does, you could end up breaking Moose internals.

   Moose Keywords
       If you are using Moose or Moose::Role its best to avoid these keywords:

       extends
       with
       has
       before
       after
       around
       super
       override
       inner
       augment
       confess
       blessed

   Moose::Util::TypeConstraints Keywords
       If you are using Moose::Util::TypeConstraints its best to avoid these
       keywords

       type
       subtype
       class_type
       role_type
       maybe_type
       as
       where
       message
       optimize_as
       coerce
       from
       via
       enum
       find_type_constraint
       register_type_constraint

   Avoiding collisions
       Turning off Moose

       To remove the sugar functions Moose exports just add "no Moose" at the
       bottom of your code:

	 package Thing;
	 use Moose;

	 # code here

	 no Moose;

       This will unexport the sugar functions that Moose originally exported.
       The same will also work for Moose::Role and
       Moose::Util::TypeConstraints.

       Sub::Exporter features

       Moose, Moose::Role and Moose::Util::TypeConstraints all use
       Sub::Exporter to handle all their exporting needs. This means that all
       the features that Sub::Exporter provides are also available to them.

       For instance, with Sub::Exporter you can rename keywords, like so:

	 package LOL::Cat;
	 use Moose 'has' => { -as => 'i_can_haz' };

	 i_can_haz 'cheeseburger' => (
	     is      => 'rw',
	     trigger => sub { print "NOM NOM" }
	 );

	 LOL::Cat->new->cheeseburger('KTHNXBYE');

       See the Sub::Exporter docs for more information.

       namespace::clean

       You can also use namespace::clean to clean up your namespace, but you
       must be careful not to remove "meta" when doing so:

	 package Foo;
	 use Moose;
	 use namespace::clean -except => 'meta';
	 # ...
