NAME
     avbdiagnose -- This line parsed for whatis database.

SYNOPSIS
     avbdiagnose

DESCRIPTION
     The avbdiagnose tool is used to capture a snapshot of the current AVB
     system state and help diagnose common issues with AVB.

     avbdiagnose looks for the system to determine that it actually has AVB
     capable interfaces and that at least one of these has been enabled.

     avbdiagnose will produce a number of warnings which may not be errors
     depending on the setup of the system.  Things such as missing local or
     remote attributes for MSRP will be flagged as a warning but is not an
     error if the Mac is not sourcing or sinking streams as appropriate for
     the warning.

     avbdiagnose will flag potential errors and warnings and suggest filing a
     radar report at http://bugreporter.apple.com.  Please attach the gener-
     ated file at /tmp/avbdiagnose-&ltdate&gt.bz2 to the bug report. An error or
     warning report may be the result of a network device. Please use your
     best judgement before filing the bug report.

FILES
     /tmp/avbdiagnose-&ltdate&gt.bz2		   output The information
						   gathered by avbdiagnose
						   including the command line
						   output, an ioreg dump and
						   the current system.log and
						   kernel.log files.
