NAME
       glGetActiveUniformName - query the name of an active uniform

C SPECIFICATION
       void glGetActiveUniformName(GLuint program, GLuint uniformIndex,
				   GLsizei bufSize, GLsizei *length,
				   GLchar *uniformName);

PARAMETERS
       program
	   Specifies the program containing the active uniform index
	   uniformIndex.

       uniformIndex
	   Specifies the index of the active uniform whose name to query.

       bufSize
	   Specifies the size of the buffer, in units of GLchar, of the buffer
	   whose address is specified in uniformName.

       length
	   Specifies the address of a variable that will receive the number of
	   characters that were or would have been written to the buffer
	   addressed by uniformName.

       uniformName
	   Specifies the address of a buffer into which the GL will place the
	   name of the active uniform at uniformIndex within program.

DESCRIPTION
       glGetActiveUniformName returns the name of the active uniform at
       uniformIndex within program. If uniformName is not NULL, up to bufSize
       characters (including a nul-terminator) will be written into the array
       whose address is specified by uniformName. If length is not NULL, the
       number of characters that were (or would have been) written into
       uniformName (not including the nul-terminator) will be placed in the
       variable whose address is specified in length. If length is NULL, no
       length is returned. The length of the longest uniform name in program
       is given by the value of GL_ACTIVE_UNIFORM_MAX_LENGTH, which can be
       queried with glGetProgram().

       If glGetActiveUniformName is not successful, nothing is written to
       length or uniformName.


       program must be the name of a program for which the command
       glLinkProgram() has been issued in the past. It is not necessary for
       program to have been linked successfully. The link could have failed
       because the number of active uniforms exceeded the limit.


       uniformIndex must be an active uniform index of the program program, in
       the range zero to GL_ACTIVE_UNIFORMS - 1. The value of
       GL_ACTIVE_UNIFORMS can be queried with glGetProgram().

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if uniformIndex is greater than or equal
       to the value of GL_ACTIVE_UNIFORMS.


       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if bufSize is negative.


       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if program is not the name of a program
       object for which glLinkProgram() has been issued.
