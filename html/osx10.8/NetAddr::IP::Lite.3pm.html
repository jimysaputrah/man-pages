NAME
       NetAddr::IP::Lite - Manages IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and subnets

SYNOPSIS
	 use NetAddr::IP::Lite qw(
	       Zeros
	       Ones
	       V4mask
	       V4net
	       :aton	       DEPRECATED !
	       :old_nth
	       :upper
	       :lower
	 );

	 my $ip = new NetAddr::IP::Lite '127.0.0.1';
	       or if your prefer
	 my $ip = NetAddr::IP::Lite-&gtnew('127.0.0.1);
	       or from a packed IPv4 address
	 my $ip = new_from_aton NetAddr::IP::Lite (inet_aton('127.0.0.1'));
	       or from an octal filtered IPv4 address
	 my $ip = new_no NetAddr::IP::Lite '127.012.0.0';

	 print "The address is ", $ip-&gtaddr, " with mask ", $ip-&gtmask, "\n" ;

	 if ($ip-&gtwithin(new NetAddr::IP::Lite "127.0.0.0", "255.0.0.0")) {
	     print "Is a loopback address\n";
	 }

				       # This prints 127.0.0.1/32
	 print "You can also say $ip...\n";

	 The following four functions return ipV6 representations of:

	 ::					  = Zeros();
	 FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF  = Ones();
	 FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF::	  = V4mask();
	 ::FFFF:FFFF				  = V4net();

INSTALLATION
       Un-tar the distribution in an appropriate directory and type:

	       perl Makefile.PL
	       make
	       make test
	       make install

       NetAddr::IP::Lite depends on NetAddr::IP::Util which installs by
       default with its primary functions compiled using Perl's XS extensions
       to build a 'C' library. If you do not have a 'C' complier available or
       would like the slower Pure Perl version for some other reason, then
       type:

	       perl Makefile.PL -noxs
	       make
	       make test
	       make install

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides an object-oriented abstraction on top of IP
       addresses or IP subnets, that allows for easy manipulations. Most of
       the operations of NetAddr::IP are supported. This module will work with
       older versions of Perl and is compatible with Math::BigInt.

       * By default NetAddr::IP functions and methods return string IPv6
       addresses in uppercase.	To change that to lowercase:

       NOTE: the AUGUST 2010 RFC5952 states:

	   4.3. Lowercase

	     The characters "a", "b", "c", "d", "e", and "f" in an IPv6
	     address MUST be represented in lowercase.

       It is recommended that all NEW applications using NetAddr::IP::Lite be
       invoked as shown on the next line.

	 use NetAddr::IP::Lite qw(:lower);

       * To ensure the current IPv6 string case behavior even if the default
       changes:

	 use NetAddr::IP::Lite qw(:upper);

       The internal representation of all IP objects is in 128 bit IPv6
       notation.  IPv4 and IPv6 objects may be freely mixed.

       The supported operations are described below:

   Overloaded Operators
       Assignment ("=")
	   Has been optimized to copy one NetAddr::IP::Lite object to another
	   very quickly.

       "-&gtcopy()"
	   The assignment ("=") operation is only put in to operation when the
	   copied object is further mutated by another overloaded operation.
	   See overload SPECIAL SYMBOLS FOR "use overload" for details.

	   "-&gtcopy()" actually creates a new object when called.

       Stringification
	   An object can be used just as a string. For instance, the following
	   code

		   my $ip = new NetAddr::IP::Lite '192.168.1.123';
		   print "$ip\n";

	   Will print the string 192.168.1.123/32.

		   my $ip = new6 NetAddr::IP::Lite '192.168.1.123';
		   print "$ip\n";

	   Will print the string 0:0:0:0:0:0:C0A8:17B/128

       Equality
	   You can test for equality with either "eq", "ne", "==" or "!=".
	   "eq", "ne" allows the comparison with arbitrary strings as well as
	   NetAddr::IP::Lite objects. The following example:

	       if (NetAddr::IP::Lite-&gtnew('127.0.0.1','255.0.0.0') eq '127.0.0.1/8')
		  { print "Yes\n"; }

	   Will print out "Yes".

	   Comparison with "==" and "!=" requires both operands to be
	   NetAddr::IP::Lite objects.

       Comparison via &gt, &lt, &gt=, &lt=, &lt=&gt and "cmp"
	   Internally, all network objects are represented in 128 bit format.
	   The numeric representation of the network is compared through the
	   corresponding operation. Comparisons are tried first on the address
	   portion of the object and if that is equal then the NUMERIC cidr
	   portion of the masks are compared. This leads to the
	   counterintuitive result that

		   /24 &gt /16

	   Comparison should not be done on netaddr objects with different
	   CIDR as this may produce indeterminate - unexpected results, rather
	   the determination of which netblock is larger or smaller should be
	   done by comparing

		   $ip1-&gtmasklen &lt=&gt $ip2-&gtmasklen

       Addition of a constant ("+")
	   Add a 32 bit signed constant to the address part of a NetAddr
	   object.  This operation changes the address part to point so many
	   hosts above the current objects start address. For instance, this
	   code:

	       print NetAddr::IP::Lite-&gtnew('127.0.0.1/8') + 5;

	   will output 127.0.0.6/8. The address will wrap around at the
	   broadcast back to the network address. This code:

	       print NetAddr::IP::Lite-&gtnew('10.0.0.1/24') + 255;

	   outputs 10.0.0.0/24.

	   Returns the the unchanged object when the constant is missing or
	   out of range.

	       2147483647 &lt= constant &gt= -2147483648

       Subtraction of a constant ("-")
	   The complement of the addition of a constant.

       Difference ("-")
	   Returns the difference between the address parts of two
	   NetAddr::IP::Lite objects address parts as a 32 bit signed number.

	   Returns undef if the difference is out of range.

       Auto-increment
	   Auto-incrementing a NetAddr::IP::Lite object causes the address
	   part to be adjusted to the next host address within the subnet. It
	   will wrap at the broadcast address and start again from the network
	   address.

       Auto-decrement
	   Auto-decrementing a NetAddr::IP::Lite object performs exactly the
	   opposite of auto-incrementing it, as you would expect.

   Methods
       "-&gtnew([$addr, [ $mask|IPv6 ]])"
       "-&gtnew6([$addr, [ $mask]])"
       "-&gtnew_no([$addr, [ $mask]])"
       "-&gtnew_from_aton($netaddr)"
       new_cis and new_cis6 are DEPRECATED
       "-&gtnew_cis("$addr $mask)"
       "-&gtnew_cis6("$addr $mask)"
	   The first two methods create a new address with the supplied
	   address in $addr and an optional netmask $mask, which can be
	   omitted to get a /32 or /128 netmask for IPv4 / IPv6 addresses
	   respectively.

	   The third method "new_no" is exclusively for IPv4 addresses and
	   filters improperly formatted dot quad strings for leading 0's that
	   would normally be interpreted as octal format by NetAddr per the
	   specifications for inet_aton.

	   new_from_aton takes a packed IPv4 address and assumes a /32 mask.
	   This function replaces the DEPRECATED :aton functionality which is
	   fundamentally broken.

	   The last two methods new_cis and new_cis6 differ from new and new6
	   only in that they except the common Cisco address notation for
	   address/mask pairs with a space as a separator instead of a slash
	   (/)

	   These methods are DEPRECATED because the functionality is now
	   included in the other "new" methods

	     i.e.  -&gtnew_cis('1.2.3.0 24')
		   or
		   -&gtnew_cis6('::1.2.3.0 120')

	   "-&gtnew6" and "-&gtnew_cis6" mark the address as being in ipV6 address
	   space even if the format would suggest otherwise.

	     i.e.  -&gtnew6('1.2.3.4') will result in ::102:304

	     addresses submitted to -&gtnew in ipV6 notation will
	     remain in that notation permanently. i.e.
		   -&gtnew('::1.2.3.4') will result in ::102:304
	     whereas new('1.2.3.4') would print out as 1.2.3.4

	     See "STRINGIFICATION" below.

	   $addr can be almost anything that can be resolved to an IP address
	   in all the notations I have seen over time. It can optionally
	   contain the mask in CIDR notation. If the OPTIONAL perl module
	   Socket6 is available in the local library it will autoload and ipV6
	   host6 names will be resolved as well as ipV4 hostnames.

	   prefix notation is understood, with the limitation that the range
	   specified by the prefix must match with a valid subnet.

	   Addresses in the same format returned by "inet_aton" or
	   "gethostbyname" can also be understood, although no mask can be
	   specified for them. The default is to not attempt to recognize this
	   format, as it seems to be seldom used.

	   ###### DEPRECATED, will be remove in version 5 ############ To
	   accept addresses in that format, invoke the module as in

	     use NetAddr::IP::Lite ':aton'

	   ###### USE new_from_aton instead ##########################

	   If called with no arguments, 'default' is assumed.

	   $addr can be any of the following and possibly more...

	     n.n
	     n.n/mm
	     n.n mm
	     n.n.n
	     n.n.n/mm
	     n.n.n mm
	     n.n.n.n
	     n.n.n.n/mm 	   32 bit cidr notation
	     n.n.n.n mm
	     n.n.n.n/m.m.m.m
	     n.n.n.n m.m.m.m
	     loopback, localhost, broadcast, any, default
	     x.x.x.x/host
	     0xABCDEF, 0b111111000101011110, (or a bcd number)
	     a netaddr as returned by 'inet_aton'

	   Any RFC1884 notation

	     ::n.n.n.n
	     ::n.n.n.n/mmm	   128 bit cidr notation
	     ::n.n.n.n/::m.m.m.m
	     ::x:x
	     ::x:x/mmm
	     x:x:x:x:x:x:x:x
	     x:x:x:x:x:x:x:x/mmm
	     x:x:x:x:x:x:x:x/m:m:m:m:m:m:m:m any RFC1884 notation
	     loopback, localhost, unspecified, any, default
	     ::x:x/host
	     0xABCDEF, 0b111111000101011110 within the limits
	     of perl's number resolution
	     123456789012  a 'big' bcd number (bigger than perl likes)
	     and Math::BigInt

	   If called with no arguments, 'default' is assumed.

       "-&gtbroadcast()"
	   Returns a new object referring to the broadcast address of a given
	   subnet. The broadcast address has all ones in all the bit positions
	   where the netmask has zero bits. This is normally used to address
	   all the hosts in a given subnet.

       "-&gtnetwork()"
	   Returns a new object referring to the network address of a given
	   subnet. A network address has all zero bits where the bits of the
	   netmask are zero. Normally this is used to refer to a subnet.

       "-&gtaddr()"
	   Returns a scalar with the address part of the object as an IPv4 or
	   IPv6 text string as appropriate. This is useful for printing or for
	   passing the address part of the NetAddr::IP::Lite object to other
	   components that expect an IP address. If the object is an ipV6
	   address or was created using -&gtnew6($ip) it will be reported in
	   ipV6 hex format otherwise it will be reported in dot quad format
	   only if it resides in ipV4 address space.

       "-&gtmask()"
	   Returns a scalar with the mask as an IPv4 or IPv6 text string as
	   described above.

       "-&gtmasklen()"
	   Returns a scalar the number of one bits in the mask.

       "-&gtbits()"
	   Returns the width of the address in bits. Normally 32 for v4 and
	   128 for v6.

       "-&gtversion()"
	   Returns the version of the address or subnet. Currently this can be
	   either 4 or 6.

       "-&gtcidr()"
	   Returns a scalar with the address and mask in CIDR notation. A
	   NetAddr::IP::Lite object stringifies to the result of this
	   function.  (see comments about -&gtnew6() and -&gtaddr() for output
	   formats)

       "-&gtaton()"
	   Returns the address part of the NetAddr::IP::Lite object in the
	   same format as the "inet_aton()" or "ipv6_aton" function
	   respectively. If the object was created using -&gtnew6($ip), the
	   address returned will always be in ipV6 format, even for addresses
	   in ipV4 address space.

       "-&gtrange()"
	   Returns a scalar with the base address and the broadcast address
	   separated by a dash and spaces. This is called range notation.

       "-&gtnumeric()"
	   When called in a scalar context, will return a numeric
	   representation of the address part of the IP address. When called
	   in an array context, it returns a list of two elements. The first
	   element is as described, the second element is the numeric
	   representation of the netmask.

	   This method is essential for serializing the representation of a
	   subnet.

       "-&gtbigint()"
	   When called in a scalar context, will return a Math::BigInt
	   representation of the address part of the IP address. When called
	   in an array contest, it returns a list of two elements. The first
	   element is as described, the second element is the Math::BigInt
	   representation of the netmask.

       "$me-&gtcontains($other)"
	   Returns true when $me completely contains $other. False is returned
	   otherwise and "undef" is returned if $me and $other are not both
	   "NetAddr::IP::Lite" objects.

       "$me-&gtwithin($other)"
	   The complement of "-&gtcontains()". Returns true when $me is
	   completely contained within $other, undef if $me and $other are not
	   both "NetAddr::IP::Lite" objects.

       "-&gtfirst()"
	   Returns a new object representing the first usable IP address
	   within the subnet (ie, the first host address).

       "-&gtlast()"
	   Returns a new object representing the last usable IP address within
	   the subnet (ie, one less than the broadcast address).

       "-&gtnth($index)"
	   Returns a new object representing the n-th usable IP address within
	   the subnet (ie, the n-th host address).  If no address is available
	   (for example, when the network is too small for $index hosts),
	   "undef" is returned.

	   Version 4.00 of NetAddr::IP and version 1.00 of NetAddr::IP::Lite
	   implements "-&gtnth($index)" and "-&gtnum()" exactly as the
	   documentation states.  Previous versions behaved slightly
	   differently and not in a consistent manner.

	   To use the old behavior for "-&gtnth($index)" and "-&gtnum()":

	     use NetAddr::IP::Lite qw(:old_nth);

	     old behavior:
	     NetAddr::IP-&gtnew('10/32')-&gtnth(0) == undef
	     NetAddr::IP-&gtnew('10/32')-&gtnth(1) == undef
	     NetAddr::IP-&gtnew('10/31')-&gtnth(0) == undef
	     NetAddr::IP-&gtnew('10/31')-&gtnth(1) == 10.0.0.1/31
	     NetAddr::IP-&gtnew('10/30')-&gtnth(0) == undef
	     NetAddr::IP-&gtnew('10/30')-&gtnth(1) == 10.0.0.1/30
	     NetAddr::IP-&gtnew('10/30')-&gtnth(2) == 10.0.0.2/30
	     NetAddr::IP-&gtnew('10/30')-&gtnth(3) == 10.0.0.3/30

	   Note that in each case, the broadcast address is represented in the
	   output set and that the 'zero'th index is alway undef except for a
	   point-to-point /31 or /127 network where there are exactly two
	   addresses in the network.

	     new behavior:
	     NetAddr::IP-&gtnew('10/32')-&gtnth(0)	== 10.0.0.0/32
	     NetAddr::IP-&gtnew('10.1/32'-&gtnth(0) == 10.0.0.1/32
	     NetAddr::IP-&gtnew('10/31')-&gtnth(0)	== 10.0.0.0/32
	     NetAddr::IP-&gtnew('10/31')-&gtnth(1)	== 10.0.0.1/32
	     NetAddr::IP-&gtnew('10/30')-&gtnth(0) == 10.0.0.1/30
	     NetAddr::IP-&gtnew('10/30')-&gtnth(1) == 10.0.0.2/30
	     NetAddr::IP-&gtnew('10/30')-&gtnth(2) == undef

	   Note that a /32 net always has 1 usable address while a /31 has
	   exactly two usable addresses for point-to-point addressing. The
	   first index (0) returns the address immediately following the
	   network address except for a /31 or /127 when it return the network
	   address.

       "-&gtnum()"
	   As of version 4.42 of NetAddr::IP and version 1.27 of
	   NetAddr::IP::Lite a /31 and /127 with return a net num value of 2
	   instead of 0 (zero) for point-to-point networks.

	   Version 4.00 of NetAddr::IP and version 1.00 of NetAddr::IP::Lite
	   return the number of usable IP addresses within the subnet, not
	   counting the broadcast or network address.

	   Previous versions worked only for ipV4 addresses, returned a
	   maximum span of 2**32 and returned the number of IP addresses not
	   counting the broadcast address.	 (one greater than the new
	   behavior)

	   To use the old behavior for "-&gtnth($index)" and "-&gtnum()":

	     use NetAddr::IP::Lite qw(:old_nth);

	   WARNING:

	   NetAddr::IP will calculate and return a numeric string for network
	   ranges as large as 2**128. These values are TEXT strings and perl
	   can treat them as integers for numeric calculations.

	   Perl on 32 bit platforms only handles integer numbers up to 2**32
	   and on 64 bit platforms to 2**64.

	   If you wish to manipulate numeric strings returned by NetAddr::IP
	   that are larger than 2**32 or 2**64, respectively,  you must load
	   additional modules such as Math::BigInt, bignum or some similar
	   package to do the integer math.
