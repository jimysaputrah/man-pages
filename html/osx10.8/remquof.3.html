REMQUO(3)		 BSD Library Functions Manual		     REMQUO(3)

NAME
     remquo -- floating-point remainder and quotient function

SYNOPSIS
     #include &ltmath.h&gt

     double
     remquo(double x, double y, int *quo);

     long double
     remquol(long double x, long double y, int *quo);

     float
     remquof(float x, float y, int *quo);

DESCRIPTION
     The remquo() functions compute the value r such that r = x - n*y, where n
     is the integer nearest the exact value of x/y.

     If there are two integers closest to x/y, n shall be the even one. If r
     is zero, it is given the same sign as x.  This is the same value that is
     returned by the remainder() function.  remquo() also calculates the lower
     seven bits of the integral quotient x/y, and gives that value the same
     sign as x/y. It stores this signed value in the object pointed to by quo.

SPECIAL VALUES
     remquo(x, y, quo) returns a NaN and raises the "invalid" floating-point
     exception if x is infinite or y is 0.

SEE ALSO
     math(3), remainder(3)

STANDARDS
     The remquo() functions conform to ISO/IEC 9899:1999(E).
