NAME
       Moose::Autobox - Autoboxed wrappers for Native Perl datatypes

SYNOPOSIS
	 use Moose::Autobox;

	 print 'Print squares from 1 to 10 : ';
	 print [ 1 .. 10 ]->map(sub { $_ * $_ })->join(', ');

DESCRIPTION
       Moose::Autobox provides an implementation of SCALAR, ARRAY, HASH & CODE
       for use with autobox. It does this using a hierarchy of roles in a
       manner similar to what Perl 6 might do. This module, like Class::MOP
       and Moose, was inspired by my work on the Perl 6 Object Space, and the
       'core types' implemented there.

   A quick word about autobox
       The autobox module provides the ability for calling 'methods' on normal
       Perl values like Scalars, Arrays, Hashes and Code references. This
       gives the illusion that Perl's types are first-class objects. However,
       this is only an illusion, albeit a very nice one.  I created this
       module because autobox itself does not actually provide an
       implementation for the Perl types but instead only provides the 'hooks'
       for others to add implementation too.

   Is this for real? or just play?
       Several people are using this module in serious applications and it
       seems to be quite stable. The underlying technologies of autobox and
       Moose::Role are also considered stable. There is some performance hit,
       but as I am fond of saying, nothing in life is free. If you have any
       questions regarding this module, either email me, or stop by #moose on
       irc.perl.org and ask around.

   Adding additional methods
       Moose::Autobox asks autobox to use the Moose::Autobox::* namespace
       prefix so as to avoid stepping on the toes of other autobox modules.
       This means that if you want to add methods to a particular perl type
       (i.e. - monkeypatch), then you must do this:

	 sub Moose::Autobox::SCALAR::bar { 42 }

       instead of this:

	 sub SCALAR::bar { 42 }

       as you would with vanilla autobox.

METHODS
       mixin_additional_role ($type, $role)
	   This will mixin an additonal $role into a certain $type. The types
	   can be SCALAR, ARRAY, HASH or CODE.

	   This can be used to add additional methods to the types, see the
	   examples/units/ directory for some examples.

TODO
       More docs
       More tests

BUGS
       All complex software has bugs lurking in it, and this module is no
       exception. If you find a bug please either email me, or add the bug to
       cpan-RT.
