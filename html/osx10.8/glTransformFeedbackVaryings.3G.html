GLTRANSFORMFEEDBACKV(3G)	  OpenGL 3.3	      GLTRANSFORMFEEDBACKV(3G)



NAME
       glTransformFeedbackVaryings - specify values to record in transform
       feedback buffers

C SPECIFICATION
       void glTransformFeedbackVaryings(GLuintprogram, GLsizeicount,
					const char **varyings,
					GLenumbufferMode);

PARAMETERS
       program
	   The name of the target program object.

       count
	   The number of varying variables used for transform feedback.

       varyings
	   An array of count zero-terminated strings specifying the names of
	   the varying variables to use for transform feedback.

       bufferMode
	   Identifies the mode used to capture the varying variables when
	   transform feedback is active.  bufferMode must be
	   GL_INTERLEAVED_ATTRIBS or GL_SEPARATE_ATTRIBS.

DESCRIPTION
       The names of the vertex or geometry shader outputs to be recorded in
       transform feedback mode are specified using
       glTransformFeedbackVaryings. When a geometry shader is active,
       transform feedback records the values of selected geometry shader
       output variables from the emitted vertices. Otherwise, the values of
       the selected vertex shader outputs are recorded.

       The state set by glTranformFeedbackVaryings is stored and takes effect
       next time glLinkProgram() is called on program. When glLinkProgram() is
       called, program is linked so that the values of the specified varying
       variables for the vertices of each primitive generated by the GL are
       written to a single buffer object if bufferMode is
       GL_INTERLEAVED_ATTRIBS or multiple buffer objects if bufferMode is
       GL_SEPARATE_ATTRIBS.

       In addition to the errors generated by glTransformFeedbackVaryings, the
       program program will fail to link if:

       o   The count specified by glTransformFeedbackVaryings is non-zero, but
	   the program object has no vertex or geometry shader.

       o   Any variable name specified in the varyings array is not declared
	   as an output in the vertex shader (or the geometry shader, if
	   active).

       o   Any two entries in the varyings array specify the same varying
	   variable.

       o   The total number of components to capture in any varying variable
	   in varyings is greater than the constant
	   GL_MAX_TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_SEPARATE_COMPONENTS and the buffer mode
	   is GL_SEPARATE_ATTRIBS.

       o   The total number of components to capture is greater than the
	   constant GL_MAX_TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_INTERLEAVED_COMPONENTS and the
	   buffer mode is GL_INTERLEAVED_ATTRIBS.


NOTES
       glGetTransformFeedbackVarying is available only if the GL version is
       3.0 or greater.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if program is not the name of a program
       object.


       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if bufferMode is GL_SEPARATE_ATTRIBS and
       count is greater than the implementation-dependent limit
       GL_MAX_TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_SEPARATE_ATTRIBS.
