NAME
       CPAN::API::HOWTO - a recipe book for programming with CPAN.pm

RECIPES
       All of these recipes assume that you have put "use CPAN" at the top of
       your program.

   What distribution contains a particular module?
	   my $distribution = CPAN::Shell->expand(
	       "Module", "Data::UUID"
	   )->distribution()->pretty_id();

       This returns a string of the form "AUTHORID/TARBALL".  If you want the
       full path and filename to this distribution on a CPAN mirror, then it
       is ".../authors/id/A/AU/AUTHORID/TARBALL".

   What modules does a particular distribution contain?
	   CPAN::Index->reload();
	   my @modules = CPAN::Shell->expand(
	       "Distribution", "JHI/Graph-0.83.tar.gz"
	   )->containsmods();

       You may also refer to a distribution in the form A/AU/AUTHORID/TARBALL.
