NAME
       sasl_decode - Decode data received



SYNOPSIS
       #include <sasl/sasl.h>


       int sasl_decode(sasl_conn_t *conn,
		      const char * input,
		       unsigned inputlen,
		      const char ** output,
		      unsigned * outputlen);


DESCRIPTION
       sasl_decode  decodes data received. After succesful authentication this
       function should be called on all data received.	It  decodes  the  data
       from  encrypted	or signed form to plain data. If there was no security
       layer negotiated the output is identical to the input.

       output contains the decoded data and is allocated/freed by the library.

       One  should  not  to  give  sasl_decode	more  data than the negotiated
       maxbufsize (see sasl_getprop).

       Note that sasl_decode can succeed and outputlen can be zero. If this is
       the case simply wait for more data and call sasl_decode again.




RETURN VALUE
       Returns	SASL_OK  on  success. See sasl_errors(3) for meanings of other
       return codes.


CONFORMING TO
       RFC 2222
