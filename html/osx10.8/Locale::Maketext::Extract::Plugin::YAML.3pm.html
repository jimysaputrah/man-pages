NAME
       Locale::Maketext::Extract::Plugin::YAML - YAML format parser

SYNOPSIS
	   $plugin = Locale::Maketext::Extract::Plugin::YAML->new(
	       $lexicon 	   # A Locale::Maketext::Extract object
	       @file_types	   # Optionally specify a list of recognised file types
	   )

	   $plugin->extract($filename,$filecontents);

DESCRIPTION
       Extracts strings to localise from YAML files.

SHORT PLUGIN NAME
	   yaml

VALID FORMATS
       Valid formats are:

       o

	       key: _"string"

       o

	       key: _'string'

       o

	       key: _'string with embedded 'quotes''

       o

	       key: |-
		    _'my folded
		    string
		    to translate'

	   Note, the left hand side of the folded string must line up with the
	   "_", otherwise YAML adds spaces at the beginning of each line.

       o

	       key: |-
		    _'my block
		    string
		    to translate
		    '
	   Note, you must use the trailing C<-> so that YAMl doesn't add a carriage
	   return after your final quote.

KNOWN FILE TYPES
       .yaml
       .yml
       .conf

REQUIRES
       YAML

NOTES
       The docs for the YAML module describes it as alpha code. It is not as
       tolerant of errors as YAML::Syck. However, because it is pure Perl, it
       is easy to hook into.

       I have seen it enter endless loops, so if xgettext.pl hangs, try
       running it again with "--verbose --verbose" (twice) enabled, so that
       you can see if the fault lies with YAML.  If it does, either correct
       the YAML source file, or use the file_types to exclude that file.

SEE ALSO
       xgettext.pl
	   for extracting translatable strings from common template systems
	   and perl source files.
