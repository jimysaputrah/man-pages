NAME
       Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint::Class - Class/TypeConstraint parallel
       hierarchy

DESCRIPTION
       This class represents type constraints for a class.

INHERITANCE
       "Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint::Class" is a subclass of
       Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint.

METHODS
       Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint::Class-&gtnew(%options)
	   This creates a new class type constraint based on the given
	   %options.

	   It takes the same options as its parent, with two exceptions.
	   First, it requires an additional option, "class", which is name of
	   the constraint's class.  Second, it automatically sets the parent
	   to the "Object" type.

	   The constructor also overrides the hand optimized type constraint
	   with one it creates internally.

       $constraint-&gtclass
	   Returns the class name associated with the constraint.

       $constraint-&gtparents
	   Returns all the type's parent types, corresponding to its parent
	   classes.

       $constraint-&gtis_subtype_of($type_name_or_object)
	   If the given type is also a class type, then this checks that the
	   type's class is a subclass of the other type's class.

	   Otherwise it falls back to the implementation in
	   Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint.

       $constraint-&gtcreate_child_type(%options)
	   This returns a new Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint object with the type
	   as its parent.

	   Note that it does not return a "Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint::Class"
	   object!

       $constraint-&gtget_message($value)
	   This is the same as "get_message" in Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint
	   except that it explicitly says "isa" was checked. This is to help
	   users deal with accidentally autovivified type constraints.

       See "BUGS" in Moose for details on reporting bugs.
