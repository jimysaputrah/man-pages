       char *argv[] (in)			    Array  of strings contain-
						    ing   command-line	 argu-
						    ments.

       Tcl_AppInitProc *appInitProc (in)	    Address of an application-
						    specific	initialization
						    procedure.	 The value for
						    this argument  is  usually
						    Tcl_AppInit.

DESCRIPTION
       Tcl_Main  can  serve  as  the main program for Tcl-based shell applica-
       tions.  A "shell application" is a program like tclsh or wish that sup-
       ports both interactive interpretation of Tcl and evaluation of a script
       contained in a file given as a  command	line  argument.   Tcl_Main  is
       offered	as  a convenience to developers of shell applications, so they
       do not have to reproduce all of the code for proper  initialization  of
       the  Tcl  library  and  interactive  shell  operation.  Other styles of
       embedding Tcl in an application are not supported by  Tcl_Main.	 Those
       must  be  achieved  by calling lower level functions in the Tcl library
       directly.

       The Tcl_Main function has been offered by the Tcl library since release
       Tcl  7.4.   In  older releases of Tcl, the Tcl library itself defined a
       function main, but that lacks flexibility of embedding style and having
       a  function  main  in  a library (particularly a shared library) causes
       problems on many systems.  Having main in the Tcl  library  would  also
       make  it  hard to use Tcl in C++ programs, since C++ programs must have
       special C++ main functions.

       Normally each shell application contains a  small  main	function  that
       does  nothing  but invoke Tcl_Main.  Tcl_Main then does all the work of
       creating and running a tclsh-like application.

       Tcl_Main is not provided by the public interface of Tcl's stub library.
       Programs  that  call  Tcl_Main  must be linked against the standard Tcl
       library.  Extensions (stub-enabled or not) are  not  intended  to  call
       Tcl_Main.

       Tcl_Main is not thread-safe.  It should only be called by a single mas-
       ter thread of a multi-threaded application.  This restriction is not  a
       problem with normal use described above.

       Tcl_Main  and therefore all applications based upon it, like tclsh, use
       Tcl_GetStdChannel to initialize the standard channels to their  default
       values. See Tcl_StandardChannels for more information.

       Tcl_Main  supports  two	modes of operation, depending on the values of
       argc and argv.  If the first few arguments  in  argv  match  ?-encoding
       name?  fileName,  where	fileName  does not begin with the character -,
       then fileName is taken to be the name of a file	containing  a  startup
       script,	and  name  is taken to be the name of the encoding of the con-
       tents of that file, which Tcl_Main will attempt	to  evaluate.	Other-
       wise, Tcl_Main will enter an interactive mode.

       In  either mode, Tcl_Main will define in its master interpreter the Tcl
       variables argc, argv, argv0, and tcl_interactive, as described  in  the
       documentation for tclsh.

       When  it  has  finished its own initialization, but before it processes
       commands, Tcl_Main calls the procedure given by the  appInitProc  argu-
       ment.   This procedure provides a "hook" for the application to perform
       its own initialization of the interpreter created by Tcl_Main, such  as
       defining  application-specific  commands.   The	procedure must have an
       interface that matches the type Tcl_AppInitProc:
	      typedef int Tcl_AppInitProc(Tcl_Interp *interp);

       AppInitProc is almost always a pointer to Tcl_AppInit; for more details
       on this procedure, see the documentation for Tcl_AppInit.

       When the appInitProc is finished, Tcl_Main enters one of its two modes.
       If a startup script has been provided, Tcl_Main	attempts  to  evaluate
       it.   Otherwise,  interactive mode begins with examination of the vari-
       able tcl_rcFileName in the master interpreter.  If that variable exists
       and  holds  the	name of a readable file, the contents of that file are
       evaluated in  the  master  interpreter.	 Then  interactive  operations
       begin, with prompts and command evaluation results written to the stan-
       dard output channel, and commands read from the standard input  channel
       and then evaluated.  The prompts written to the standard output channel
       may be  customized  by  defining  the  Tcl  variables  tcl_prompt1  and
       tcl_prompt2  as	described in the documentation for tclsh.  The prompts
       and command evaluation results are written to the standard output chan-
       nel  only if the Tcl variable tcl_interactive in the master interpreter
       holds a non-zero integer value.

       Tcl_SetMainLoop allows setting an event loop procedure to be run.  This
       allows,	for  example,  Tk  to  be dynamically loaded and set its event
       loop.  The event loop will run following the startup  script.   If  you
       are in interactive mode, setting the main loop procedure will cause the
       prompt to become fileevent based and then the loop procedure is called.
       When the loop procedure returns in interactive mode, interactive opera-
       tion will continue.  The main loop procedure  must  have  an  interface
       that matches the type Tcl_MainLoopProc:
	      typedef void Tcl_MainLoopProc(void);

       Tcl_Main  does  not  return.  Normally a program based on Tcl_Main will
       terminate when the exit command is evaluated.  In interactive mode,  if
       an  EOF	or channel error is encountered on the standard input channel,
       then Tcl_Main itself will evaluate the exit command after the main loop
       procedure  (if  any)  returns.  In non-interactive mode, after Tcl_Main
       evaluates the startup script, and the  main  loop  procedure  (if  any)
       returns, Tcl_Main will also evaluate the exit command.
