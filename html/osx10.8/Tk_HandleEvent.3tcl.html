DESCRIPTION
       Tk_HandleEvent is  a  lower-level  procedure  that  deals  with	window
       events.	  It   is   called  by	Tcl_ServiceEvent  (and	indirectly  by
       Tcl_DoOneEvent), and in a few other cases within Tk.   It  makes  call-
       backs  to any window event handlers (created by calls to Tk_CreateEven-
       tHandler) that match eventPtr and then returns.	In some cases  it  may
       be  useful  for	an  application  to bypass the Tk event queue and call
       Tk_HandleEvent directly instead of calling Tcl_QueueEvent  followed  by
       Tcl_ServiceEvent.

       This procedure may be invoked recursively.  For example, it is possible
       to invoke Tk_HandleEvent recursively from a handler called  by  Tk_Han-
       dleEvent.   This  sort of operation is useful in some modal situations,
       such as when a notifier has been popped up and an application wishes to
       wait  for  the user to click a button in the notifier before doing any-
       thing else.
