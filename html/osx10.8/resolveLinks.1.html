NAME
     resolveLinks -- Resolves link requests in collections of HTML files

SYNOPSIS
     resolveLinks [-a] [-b basepath] [-d debugflags] [-D] [-h]
		  [-i installpath] [-n] [-N] [-P] [-r refanchorprefix]
		  [-s seedfile] [-S seedfilebasepath] [-t nthreads]
		  [-x xreffile] directory

ENVIRONMENT
     This program is a helper tool that is usually run by the gatherHeaderDoc
     tool to generate links within HeaderDoc output.  Although it is usually
     not run directly, it can be useful to do so when linking together multi-
     ple documentation sets in an installed set.

SEE ALSO
     For more information on gatherHeaderDoc and HeaderDoc, see
     headerdoc2html(1) and gatherheaderdoc(1).
