NAME
       SELECT_INTO - define a new table from the results of a query

SYNOPSIS
       [ WITH [ RECURSIVE ] with_query [, ...] ]
       SELECT [ ALL | DISTINCT [ ON ( expression [, ...] ) ] ]
	   * | expression [ [ AS ] output_name ] [, ...]
	   INTO [ TEMPORARY | TEMP | UNLOGGED ] [ TABLE ] new_table
	   [ FROM from_item [, ...] ]
	   [ WHERE condition ]
	   [ GROUP BY expression [, ...] ]
	   [ HAVING condition [, ...] ]
	   [ WINDOW window_name AS ( window_definition ) [, ...] ]
	   [ { UNION | INTERSECT | EXCEPT } [ ALL | DISTINCT ] select ]
	   [ ORDER BY expression [ ASC | DESC | USING operator ] [ NULLS { FIRST | LAST } ] [, ...] ]
	   [ LIMIT { count | ALL } ]
	   [ OFFSET start [ ROW | ROWS ] ]
	   [ FETCH { FIRST | NEXT } [ count ] { ROW | ROWS } ONLY ]
	   [ FOR { UPDATE | SHARE } [ OF table_name [, ...] ] [ NOWAIT ] [...] ]

DESCRIPTION
       SELECT INTO creates a new table and fills it with data computed by a
       query. The data is not returned to the client, as it is with a normal
       SELECT. The new table's columns have the names and data types
       associated with the output columns of the SELECT.

PARAMETERS
       TEMPORARY or TEMP
	   If specified, the table is created as a temporary table. Refer to
	   CREATE TABLE (CREATE_TABLE(7)) for details.

       UNLOGGED
	   If specified, the table is created as an unlogged table. Refer to
	   CREATE TABLE (CREATE_TABLE(7)) for details.

       new_table
	   The name (optionally schema-qualified) of the table to be created.

       All other parameters are described in detail under SELECT(7).

NOTES
       CREATE TABLE AS (CREATE_TABLE_AS(7)) is functionally similar to SELECT
       INTO.  CREATE TABLE AS is the recommended syntax, since this form of
       SELECT INTO is not available in ECPG or PL/pgSQL, because they
       interpret the INTO clause differently. Furthermore, CREATE TABLE AS
       offers a superset of the functionality provided by SELECT INTO.

       Prior to PostgreSQL 8.1, the table created by SELECT INTO included OIDs
       by default. In PostgreSQL 8.1, this is not the case -- to include OIDs
       in the new table, the default_with_oids configuration variable must be
       enabled. Alternatively, CREATE TABLE AS can be used with the WITH OIDS
       clause.

EXAMPLES
       Create a new table films_recent consisting of only recent entries from
       the table films:

	   SELECT * INTO films_recent FROM films WHERE date_prod >= '2002-01-01';

COMPATIBILITY
       The SQL standard uses SELECT INTO to represent selecting values into
       scalar variables of a host program, rather than creating a new table.
       This indeed is the usage found in ECPG (see Chapter 33, ECPG - Embedded
       SQL in C, in the documentation) and PL/pgSQL (see Chapter 39, PL/pgSQL
       - SQL Procedural Language, in the documentation). The PostgreSQL usage
       of SELECT INTO to represent table creation is historical. It is best to
       use CREATE TABLE AS for this purpose in new code.
