NAME
       glDrawElements - render primitives from array data

C SPECIFICATION
       void glDrawElements(GLenum mode, GLsizei count, GLenum type,
			   const GLvoid * indices);

PARAMETERS
       mode
	   Specifies what kind of primitives to render. Symbolic constants
	   GL_POINTS, GL_LINE_STRIP, GL_LINE_LOOP, GL_LINES,
	   GL_LINE_STRIP_ADJACENCY, GL_LINES_ADJACENCY, GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP,
	   GL_TRIANGLE_FAN, GL_TRIANGLES, GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP_ADJACENCY and
	   GL_TRIANGLES_ADJACENCY are accepted.

       count
	   Specifies the number of elements to be rendered.

       type
	   Specifies the type of the values in indices. Must be one of
	   GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT, or GL_UNSIGNED_INT.

       indices
	   Specifies a pointer to the location where the indices are stored.

DESCRIPTION
       glDrawElements specifies multiple geometric primitives with very few
       subroutine calls. Instead of calling a GL function to pass each
       individual vertex, normal, texture coordinate, edge flag, or color, you
       can prespecify separate arrays of vertices, normals, and so on, and use
       them to construct a sequence of primitives with a single call to
       glDrawElements.

       When glDrawElements is called, it uses count sequential elements from
       an enabled array, starting at indices to construct a sequence of
       geometric primitives.  mode specifies what kind of primitives are
       constructed and how the array elements construct these primitives. If
       more than one array is enabled, each is used.

       Vertex attributes that are modified by glDrawElements have an
       unspecified value after glDrawElements returns. Attributes that aren't
       modified maintain their previous values.

NOTES
       GL_LINE_STRIP_ADJACENCY, GL_LINES_ADJACENCY,
       GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP_ADJACENCY and GL_TRIANGLES_ADJACENCY are available
       only if the GL version is 3.2 or greater.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if mode is not an accepted value.


       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if count is negative.


       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if a geometry shader is active and
       mode is incompatible with the input primitive type of the geometry
       shader in the currently installed program object.


       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if a non-zero buffer object name is
       bound to an enabled array or the element array and the buffer object's
       data store is currently mapped.
