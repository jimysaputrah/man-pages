NAME
     kdcsetup -- Kerberos -- Open Directory Single Sign On

SYNOPSIS
     kdcsetup [-v debug_level] [-a admin_name] [-p password] REALM

DESCRIPTION
     kdcsetup is a tool for configuring an Apple Open Directory KDC. It cre-
     ates the needed Kerberos files and data for an Open Director master.

     -v debug_level  Controls the amount of output generated by kdcsetup.  0
		     prints errors and very basic information.	1 prints gen-
		     eratal status information.  Higher levels may add pro-
		     gressively more detail.

     -a admin_name   Name of a directory administrator authorized to make
		     changes in Open Directory.  This admin will be used as
		     the administrator in the KDC database.  Required parame-
		     ter.  Note: this is not a principal name.

     -p password     The password for the above admin.	Required parameter.

     REALM	     The name of the realm that this KDC serves.  Required
		     parameter.

FILES
     /var/db/krb5kdc/		    directory where all the config & database
				    files for the KDC are stored
     /var/log/krb5kdc/		    directory where the log files from the KDC
				    are written

NOTES
     kdcsetup is automatically run when creating an Open Directory Master.  It
     should NEVER be run manually and will likely be deprecated in the future.
