NAME
       Tcl_DumpActiveMemory, Tcl_InitMemory, Tcl_ValidateAllMemory - Validated
       memory allocation interface

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lttcl.h&gt

       int
       Tcl_DumpActiveMemory(fileName)

       void
       Tcl_InitMemory(interp)

       void
       Tcl_ValidateAllMemory(fileName, line)


ARGUMENTS
       Tcl_Interp *interp (in)		  Tcl interpreter in which to add com-
					  mands.

       const char *fileName (in)	  For  Tcl_DumpActiveMemory,  name  of
					  the file to which memory information
					  will	 be  written.	For  Tcl_Vali-
					  dateAllMemory, name of the file from
					  which  the  call is being made (nor-
					  mally __FILE__).

       int line (in)			  Line number at  which  the  call  to
					  Tcl_ValidateAllMemory  is made (nor-
					  mally __LINE__).

DESCRIPTION
       These functions provide access to  Tcl  memory  debugging  information.
       They  are only functional when Tcl has been compiled with TCL_MEM_DEBUG
       defined at compile-time.  When  TCL_MEM_DEBUG  is  not  defined,  these
       functions are all no-ops.

       Tcl_DumpActiveMemory will output a list of all currently allocated mem-
       ory to the specified file.  The information output for  each  allocated
       block  of  memory  is:	starting and ending addresses (excluding guard
       zone), size, source file where ckalloc was called to allocate the block
       and  line  number  in  that  file.   It	is  especially	useful to call
       Tcl_DumpActiveMemory after the Tcl interpreter has been deleted.

       Tcl_InitMemory adds the Tcl memory command to the interpreter given  by
       interp.	Tcl_InitMemory is called by Tcl_Main.

       Tcl_ValidateAllMemory  forces  a  validation  of the guard zones of all
       currently allocated blocks of memory.  Normally validation of  a  block
       occurs when its freed, unless full validation is enabled, in which case
       validation of all blocks occurs when ckalloc  and  ckfree  are  called.
       This function forces the validation to occur at any point.
