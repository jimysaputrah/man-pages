ALTER DATABASE(7)	PostgreSQL 9.1.4 Documentation	     ALTER DATABASE(7)



NAME
       ALTER_DATABASE - change a database

SYNOPSIS
       ALTER DATABASE name [ [ WITH ] option [ ... ] ]

       where option can be:

	   CONNECTION LIMIT connlimit

       ALTER DATABASE name RENAME TO new_name

       ALTER DATABASE name OWNER TO new_owner

       ALTER DATABASE name SET TABLESPACE new_tablespace

       ALTER DATABASE name SET configuration_parameter { TO | = } { value | DEFAULT }
       ALTER DATABASE name SET configuration_parameter FROM CURRENT
       ALTER DATABASE name RESET configuration_parameter
       ALTER DATABASE name RESET ALL

DESCRIPTION
       ALTER DATABASE changes the attributes of a database.

       The first form changes certain per-database settings. (See below for
       details.) Only the database owner or a superuser can change these
       settings.

       The second form changes the name of the database. Only the database
       owner or a superuser can rename a database; non-superuser owners must
       also have the CREATEDB privilege. The current database cannot be
       renamed. (Connect to a different database if you need to do that.)

       The third form changes the owner of the database. To alter the owner,
       you must own the database and also be a direct or indirect member of
       the new owning role, and you must have the CREATEDB privilege. (Note
       that superusers have all these privileges automatically.)

       The fourth form changes the default tablespace of the database. Only
       the database owner or a superuser can do this; you must also have
       create privilege for the new tablespace. This command physically moves
       any tables or indexes in the database's old default tablespace to the
       new tablespace. Note that tables and indexes in non-default tablespaces
       are not affected.

       The remaining forms change the session default for a run-time
       configuration variable for a PostgreSQL database. Whenever a new
       session is subsequently started in that database, the specified value
       becomes the session default value. The database-specific default
       overrides whatever setting is present in postgresql.conf or has been
       received from the postgres command line. Only the database owner or a
       superuser can change the session defaults for a database. Certain
       variables cannot be set this way, or can only be set by a superuser.

PARAMETERS
       name
	   The name of the database whose attributes are to be altered.

       connlimit
	   How many concurrent connections can be made to this database. -1
	   means no limit.

       new_name
	   The new name of the database.

       new_owner
	   The new owner of the database.

       new_tablespace
	   The new default tablespace of the database.

       configuration_parameter, value
	   Set this database's session default for the specified configuration
	   parameter to the given value. If value is DEFAULT or, equivalently,
	   RESET is used, the database-specific setting is removed, so the
	   system-wide default setting will be inherited in new sessions. Use
	   RESET ALL to clear all database-specific settings.  SET FROM
	   CURRENT saves the session's current value of the parameter as the
	   database-specific value.

	   See SET(7) and Chapter 18, Server Configuration, in the
	   documentation for more information about allowed parameter names
	   and values.

NOTES
       It is also possible to tie a session default to a specific role rather
       than to a database; see ALTER ROLE (ALTER_ROLE(7)). Role-specific
       settings override database-specific ones if there is a conflict.

EXAMPLES
       To disable index scans by default in the database test:

	   ALTER DATABASE test SET enable_indexscan TO off;

COMPATIBILITY
       The ALTER DATABASE statement is a PostgreSQL extension.
