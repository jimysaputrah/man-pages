NAME
       Moose::Meta::Role::Composite - An object to represent the set of roles

DESCRIPTION
       A composite is a role that consists of a set of two or more roles.

       The API of a composite role is almost identical to that of a regular
       role.

INHERITANCE
       "Moose::Meta::Role::Composite" is a subclass of Moose::Meta::Role.

   METHODS
       Moose::Meta::Role::Composite->new(%options)
	   This returns a new composite role object. It accepts the same
	   options as its parent class, with a few changes:

	   o	   roles

		   This option is an array reference containing a list of
		   Moose::Meta::Role object. This is a required option.

	   o	   name

		   If a name is not given, one is generated from the roles
		   provided.

	   o	   apply_params(\%role_params)

		   Creates a new RoleSummation role application with
		   %role_params and applies the composite role to it. The
		   RoleSummation role application class used is determined by
		   the composite role's "application_role_summation_class"
		   attribute.

	   o	   reinitialize($metaclass)

		   Like "Class::MOP::Package->reinitialize", but doesn't allow
		   passing a string with the package name, as there is no real
		   package for composite roles.

BUGS
       See "BUGS" in Moose for details on reporting bugs.
