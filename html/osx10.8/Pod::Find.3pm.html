Pod::Find(3pm)	       Perl Programmers Reference Guide 	Pod::Find(3pm)



NAME
       Pod::Find - find POD documents in directory trees

SYNOPSIS
	 use Pod::Find qw(pod_find simplify_name);
	 my %pods = pod_find({ -verbose => 1, -inc => 1 });
	 foreach(keys %pods) {
	    print "found library POD `$pods{$_}' in $_\n";
	 }

	 print "podname=",simplify_name('a/b/c/mymodule.pod'),"\n";

	 $location = pod_where( { -inc => 1 }, "Pod::Find" );

DESCRIPTION
       Pod::Find provides a set of functions to locate POD files.  Note that
       no function is exported by default to avoid pollution of your
       namespace, so be sure to specify them in the use statement if you need
       them:

	 use Pod::Find qw(pod_find);

       From this version on the typical SCM (software configuration
       management) files/directories like RCS, CVS, SCCS, .svn are ignored.

   "pod_find( { %opts } , @directories )"
       The function pod_find searches for POD documents in a given set of
       files and/or directories. It returns a hash with the file names as keys
       and the POD name as value. The POD name is derived from the file name
       and its position in the directory tree.

       E.g. when searching in $HOME/perl5lib, the file
       $HOME/perl5lib/MyModule.pm would get the POD name MyModule, whereas
       $HOME/perl5lib/Myclass/Subclass.pm would be Myclass::Subclass. The name
       information can be used for POD translators.

       Only text files containing at least one valid POD command are found.

       A warning is printed if more than one POD file with the same POD name
       is found, e.g. CPAN.pm in different directories. This usually indicates
       duplicate occurrences of modules in the @INC search path.

       OPTIONS The first argument for pod_find may be a hash reference with
       options. The rest are either directories that are searched recursively
       or files.  The POD names of files are the plain basenames with any
       Perl-like extension (.pm, .pl, .pod) stripped.

       "-verbose => 1"
	   Print progress information while scanning.

       "-perl => 1"
	   Apply Perl-specific heuristics to find the correct PODs. This
	   includes stripping Perl-like extensions, omitting subdirectories
	   that are numeric but do not match the current Perl interpreter's
	   version id, suppressing site_perl as a module hierarchy name etc.

       "-script => 1"
	   Search for PODs in the current Perl interpreter's installation
	   scriptdir. This is taken from the local Config module.

       "-inc => 1"
	   Search for PODs in the current Perl interpreter's @INC paths. This
	   automatically considers paths specified in the "PERL5LIB"
	   environment as this is included in @INC by the Perl interpreter
	   itself.

   "simplify_name( $str )"
       The function simplify_name is equivalent to basename, but also strips
       Perl-like extensions (.pm, .pl, .pod) and extensions like .bat, .cmd on
       Win32 and OS/2, or .com on VMS, respectively.

   "pod_where( { %opts }, $pod )"
       Returns the location of a pod document given a search directory and a
       module (e.g. "File::Find") or script (e.g. "perldoc") name.

       Options:

       "-inc => 1"
	   Search @INC for the pod and also the "scriptdir" defined in the
	   Config module.

       "-dirs => [ $dir1, $dir2, ... ]"
	   Reference to an array of search directories. These are searched in
	   order before looking in @INC (if -inc). Current directory is used
	   if none are specified.

       "-verbose => 1"
	   List directories as they are searched

       Returns the full path of the first occurrence to the file.  Package
       names (eg 'A::B') are automatically converted to directory names in the
       selected directory. (eg on unix 'A::B' is converted to 'A/B').
       Additionally, '.pm', '.pl' and '.pod' are appended to the search
       automatically if required.

       A subdirectory pod/ is also checked if it exists in any of the given
       search directories. This ensures that e.g. perlfunc is found.

       It is assumed that if a module name is supplied, that that name matches
       the file name. Pods are not opened to check for the 'NAME' entry.

       A check is made to make sure that the file that is found does contain
       some pod documentation.

   "contains_pod( $file , $verbose )"
       Returns true if the supplied filename (not POD module) contains some
       pod information.
