ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT(7)PostgreSQL 9.1.4 DocumentationROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT(7)



NAME
       ROLLBACK_TO_SAVEPOINT - roll back to a savepoint

SYNOPSIS
       ROLLBACK [ WORK | TRANSACTION ] TO [ SAVEPOINT ] savepoint_name

DESCRIPTION
       Roll back all commands that were executed after the savepoint was
       established. The savepoint remains valid and can be rolled back to
       again later, if needed.


       ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT implicitly destroys all savepoints that were
       established after the named savepoint.

PARAMETERS
       savepoint_name
	   The savepoint to roll back to.

NOTES
       Use RELEASE SAVEPOINT (RELEASE_SAVEPOINT(7)) to destroy a savepoint
       without discarding the effects of commands executed after it was
       established.

       Specifying a savepoint name that has not been established is an error.

       Cursors have somewhat non-transactional behavior with respect to
       savepoints. Any cursor that is opened inside a savepoint will be closed
       when the savepoint is rolled back. If a previously opened cursor is
       affected by a FETCH or MOVE command inside a savepoint that is later
       rolled back, the cursor remains at the position that FETCH left it
       pointing to (that is, the cursor motion caused by FETCH is not rolled
       back). Closing a cursor is not undone by rolling back, either. However,
       other side-effects caused by the cursor's query (such as side-effects
       of volatile functions called by the query) are rolled back if they
       occur during a savepoint that is later rolled back. A cursor whose
       execution causes a transaction to abort is put in a cannot-execute
       state, so while the transaction can be restored using ROLLBACK TO
       SAVEPOINT, the cursor can no longer be used.

EXAMPLES
       To undo the effects of the commands executed after my_savepoint was
       established:

	   ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT my_savepoint;

       Cursor positions are not affected by savepoint rollback:

	   BEGIN;

	   DECLARE foo CURSOR FOR SELECT 1 UNION SELECT 2;

	   SAVEPOINT foo;

	   FETCH 1 FROM foo;
	    ?column?
	   ----------
		   1

	   ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT foo;

	   FETCH 1 FROM foo;
	    ?column?
	   ----------
		   2

	   COMMIT;

COMPATIBILITY
       The SQL standard specifies that the key word SAVEPOINT is mandatory,
       but PostgreSQL and Oracle allow it to be omitted. SQL allows only WORK,
       not TRANSACTION, as a noise word after ROLLBACK. Also, SQL has an
       optional clause AND [ NO ] CHAIN which is not currently supported by
       PostgreSQL. Otherwise, this command conforms to the SQL standard.
