NAME
       DBIx::Class::Manual::Glossary - Clarification of terms used.

INTRODUCTION
       This document lists various terms used in DBIx::Class and attempts to
       explain them.

DBIx::Class TERMS
   DB schema
       Refers to a single physical schema within an RDBMS. Synonymous with the
       terms 'database', for MySQL; and 'schema', for most other RDBMS(s).

       In other words, it's the 'xyz' _thing_ you're connecting to when using
       any of the following DSN(s):

	 dbi:DriverName:xyz@hostname:port
	 dbi:DriverName:database=xyz;host=hostname;port=port

   Inflation
       The act of turning database row data into objects in language-space.
       DBIx::Class result classes can be set up to inflate your data into perl
       objects which more usefully represent their contents. For example:
       DBIx::Class::InflateColumn::DateTime for datetime or timestamp column
       data.

       See also DBIx::Class::InflateColumn.

   Deflation
       The opposite of "Inflation". Existing perl objects that represent
       column values can be passed to DBIx::Class methods to store into the
       database. For example a DateTime object can be automatically deflated
       into a datetime string for insertion.

       See DBIx::Class::InflateColumn and other modules in that namespace.

   ORM
       Object-relational mapping, or Object-relationship modelling. Either way
       it's a method of mapping the contents of database tables (rows), to
       objects in programming-language-space. DBIx::Class is an ORM.

   Relationship
       In DBIx::Class a relationship defines the connection between exactly
       two tables. The relationship condition lists the columns in each table
       that contain the same values. It is used to output an SQL JOIN
       condition between the tables.

   Relationship bridge
       A relationship bridge, such as "many_to_many" defines an accessor to
       retrieve row contents across multiple relationships.

       The difference between a bridge and a relationship is, that the bridge
       cannot be used to "join" tables in a "search", instead its component
       relationships must be used.

   Schema
       A Schema object represents your entire table collection, plus the
       connection to the database. You can create one or more schema objects,
       connected to various databases, with various users, using the same set
       of table "Result class" definitions.

       At least one DBIx::Class::Schema class is needed per database.

   Result class
       A Result class defines both a source of data (usually one per table),
       and the methods that will be available in the "Row" objects created
       using that source.

       One Result class is needed per data source (table, view, query) used in
       your application, they should inherit from DBIx::Class::Core.

   ResultSource
       ResultSource objects represent the source of your data, these are
       sometimes (incorrectly) called table objects.

       ResultSources do not need to be directly created, a ResultSource
       instance is created for each "Result class" in your "Schema", by the
       proxied methods "table" and "add_columns".

       See also: "METHODS" in DBIx::Class::ResultSource

   ResultSet
       This is an object representing a set of conditions to filter data. It
       can either be an entire table, or the results of a query. The actual
       data is not held in the ResultSet, it is only a description of how to
       fetch the data.

       See also: "METHODS" in DBIx::Class::ResultSet

   Record
       See Row.

   Row
       Row objects contain your actual data. They are returned from ResultSet
       objects.

   Object
       See Row.

   join
   prefetch
SQL TERMS
   Join
       This is an SQL keyword, it is used to link multiple tables in one SQL
       statement. This enables us to fetch data from more than one table at
       once, or filter data based on content in another table, without having
       to issue multiple SQL queries.

   Normalisation
       A normalised database is a sane database. Each table contains only data
       belonging to one concept, related tables refer to the key field or
       fields of each other. Some links to webpages about normalisation can be
       found in DBIx::Class::Manual::FAQ.

   Related data
       In SQL, related data actually refers to data that are normalised into
       the same table. (Yes. DBIC does mis-use this term).
