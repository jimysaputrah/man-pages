NAME
       Net::DNS::FAQ - Frequently Asked Net::DNS Questions

SYNOPSIS
	perldoc Net::DNS::FAQ

DESCRIPTION
       This document serves to answer the most frequently asked questions on
       both the Net::DNS Mailing List and those sent to the author.

       The latest version of this FAQ can be found at
	    http://www.net-dns.org/docs/FAQ.html

GENERAL
   What is Net::DNS?
       Net::DNS is a perl implementation of a DNS resolver.

INSTALLATION
   Where can I find Test::More?
       Test::More is part of the Test-Simple packge, by Michael G Schwern.
       You should be able to find the distrubution here:

	       http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-Simple/

USAGE
   Why does Net::DNS::Resolver::query() return undef when the ANSWER section
       is empty?
       The short answer is, don't use query().	Net::DNS::Resolver::send()
       will always return the answer packet, as long as an answer was
       received.

       The longer answer is that query() is modeled after the res_query()
       function from the libresolv C library, which has similar behaviors.
