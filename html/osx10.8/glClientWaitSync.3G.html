NAME
       glClientWaitSync - block and wait for a sync object to become signaled

C SPECIFICATION
       GLenum glClientWaitSync(GLsync sync, GLbitfield flags,
			       GLuint64 timeout);

PARAMETERS
       sync
	   The sync object whose status to wait on.

       flags
	   A bitfield controlling the command flushing behavior.  flags may be
	   GL_SYNC_FLUSH_COMMANDS_BIT.

       timeout
	   The timeout, specified in nanoseconds, for which the implementation
	   should wait for sync to become signaled.

DESCRIPTION
       glClientWaitSync causes the client to block and wait for the sync
       object specified by sync to become signaled. If sync is signaled when
       glClientWaitSync is called, glClientWaitSync returns immediately,
       otherwise it will block and wait for up to timeout nanoseconds for sync
       to become signaled.

       The return value is one of four status values:

       o    GL_ALREADY_SIGNALED indicates that sync was signaled at the time
	   that glClientWaitSync was called.

       o    GL_TIMEOUT_EXPIRED indicates that at least timeout nanoseconds
	   passed and sync did not become signaled.

       o    GL_CONDITION_SATISFIED indicates that sync was signaled before the
	   timeout expired.

       o    GL_WAIT_FAILED indicates that an error occurred. Additionally, an
	   OpenGL error will be generated.


NOTES
       glClientWaitSync is available only if the GL version is 3.2 or greater.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if sync is not the name of an existing
       sync object.


       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if flags contains any unsupported flag.
