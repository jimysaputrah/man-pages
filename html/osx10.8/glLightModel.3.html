C SPECIFICATION
       void glLightModelfv( GLenum pname,
			    const GLfloat *params )
       void glLightModeliv( GLenum pname,
			    const GLint *params )


PARAMETERS
       pname  Specifies a lighting model  parameter.   GL_LIGHT_MODEL_AMBIENT,
	      GL_LIGHT_MODEL_COLOR_CONTROL,  GL_LIGHT_MODEL_LOCAL_VIEWER,  and
	      GL_LIGHT_MODEL_TWO_SIDE are accepted.

       params Specifies a pointer to the value or values that params  will  be
	      set to.

DESCRIPTION
       glLightModel  sets the lighting model parameter.  pname names a parame-
       ter and params gives the new value.  There  are	three  lighting  model
       parameters:

       GL_LIGHT_MODEL_AMBIENT
		 params  contains  four  integer or floating-point values that
		 specify the ambient  RGBA  intensity  of  the	entire	scene.
		 Integer  values  are mapped linearly such that the most posi-
		 tive representable value maps to 1.0, and the	most  negative
		 representable	value maps to -1.0.  Floating-point values are
		 mapped directly.  Neither integer nor	floating-point	values
		 are  clamped.	 The  initial ambient scene intensity is (0.2,
		 0.2, 0.2, 1.0).

       GL_LIGHT_MODEL_COLOR_CONTROL
		 params   must	 be   either   GL_SEPARATE_SPECULAR_COLOR   or
		 GL_SINGLE_COLOR.   GL_SINGLE_COLOR  specifies	that  a single
		 color is generated from the lighting computation for  a  ver-
		 tex.	GL_SEPARATE_SPECULAR_COLOR specifies that the specular
		 color computation of lighting be stored separately  from  the
		 remainder of the lighting computation.  The specular color is
		 summed into the generated fragment's color after the applica-
		 tion  of  texture mapping (if enabled).  The initial value is
		 GL_SINGLE_COLOR.

       GL_LIGHT_MODEL_LOCAL_VIEWER
		 params is a single integer or floating-point value that spec-
		 ifies how specular reflection angles are computed.  If params
		 is 0 (or 0.0),  specular  reflection  angles  take  the  view
		 direction  to	be  parallel to and in the direction of the -z
		 axis, regardless of the location of the vertex in eye coordi-
		 nates.  Otherwise, specular reflections are computed from the
		 origin of the eye coordinate system.  The initial value is 0.

       GL_LIGHT_MODEL_TWO_SIDE
		 params is a single integer or floating-point value that spec-
		 ifies whether one- or	two-sided  lighting  calculations  are
		 done for polygons.  It has no effect on the lighting calcula-
		 tions for points, lines, or bitmaps.	If  params  is	0  (or
		 0.0),	one-sided  lighting  is  specified, and only the front
		 material parameters are used in the lighting equation.   Oth-
		 erwise,  two-sided lighting is specified.  In this case, ver-
		 tices of back-facing polygons	are  lighted  using  the  back
		 material  parameters,	and have their normals reversed before
		 the lighting equation is evaluated.  Vertices of front-facing
		 polygons  are always lighted using the front material parame-
		 ters, with no change to their normals. The initial  value  is
		 0.

       In  RGBA mode, the lighted color of a vertex is the sum of the material
       emission intensity, the product of the material ambient reflectance and
       the  lighting  model full-scene ambient intensity, and the contribution
       of each enabled light source.  Each light source contributes the sum of
       three  terms: ambient, diffuse, and specular.  The ambient light source
       contribution is the product of the material ambient reflectance and the
       light's	ambient  intensity.   The diffuse light source contribution is
       the product of the material diffuse reflectance,  the  light's  diffuse
       intensity,  and the dot product of the vertex's normal with the normal-
       ized vector from the vertex to the light source.   The  specular  light
       source	contribution   is   the   product  of  the  material  specular
       reflectance, the light's specular intensity, and the dot product of the
       normalized  vertex-to-eye  and  vertex-to-light	vectors, raised to the
       power of the shininess of the material.	All three light source contri-
       butions are attenuated equally based on the distance from the vertex to
       the light source and on light source direction,	spread	exponent,  and
       spread  cutoff  angle.	All  dot  products are replaced with 0 if they
       evaluate to a negative value.

       The alpha component of the resulting lighted color is set to the  alpha
       value of the material diffuse reflectance.

       In  color index mode, the value of the lighted index of a vertex ranges
       from the ambient to the specular  values  passed  to  glMaterial  using
       GL_COLOR_INDEXES.   Diffuse  and specular coefficients, computed with a
       (.30, .59, .11) weighting of the lights' colors, the shininess  of  the
       material,  and  the same reflection and attenuation equations as in the
       RGBA case, determine how much above ambient the resulting index is.

NOTES
       GL_LIGHT_MODEL_COLOR_CONTROL is available only if the GL version is 1.2
       or greater.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if pname is not an accepted value.

       GL_INVALID_ENUM	is  generated if pname is GL_LIGHT_MODEL_COLOR_CONTROL
       and params is not one of GL_SINGLE_COLOR or GL_SEPARATE_SPECULAR_COLOR.

       GL_INVALID_OPERATION  is  generated if glLightModel is executed between
       the execution of glBegin and the corresponding execution of glEnd.
