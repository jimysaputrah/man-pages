NAME
       attrs - set/get attributes of a subroutine (deprecated)

SYNOPSIS
	   sub foo {
	       use attrs qw(locked method);
	       ...
	   }

	   @a = attrs::get(\&foo);

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE: Use of this pragma is deprecated.	Use the syntax

	   sub foo : locked method { }

       to declare attributes instead.  See also attributes.

       This pragma lets you set and get attributes for subroutines.  Setting
       attributes takes place at compile time; trying to set invalid attribute
       names causes a compile-time error. Calling "attrs::get" on a subroutine
       reference or name returns its list of attribute names. Notice that
       "attrs::get" is not exported.  Valid attributes are as follows.

       method
	   Indicates that the invoking subroutine is a method.

       locked
	   Setting this attribute is only meaningful when the subroutine or
	   method is to be called by multiple threads. When set on a method
	   subroutine (i.e. one marked with the method attribute above), perl
	   ensures that any invocation of it implicitly locks its first
	   argument before execution. When set on a non-method subroutine,
	   perl ensures that a lock is taken on the subroutine itself before
	   execution. The semantics of the lock are exactly those of one
	   explicitly taken with the "lock" operator immediately after the
	   subroutine is entered.
