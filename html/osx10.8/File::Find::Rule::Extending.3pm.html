NAME
       File::Find::Rule::Extending - the mini-guide to extending
       File::Find::Rule

SYNOPSIS
	package File::Find::Rule::Random;
	use strict;

	# take useful things from File::Find::Rule
	use base 'File::Find::Rule';

	# and force our crack into the main namespace
	sub File::Find::Rule::random () {
	    my $self = shift()-&gt_force_object;
	    $self-&gtexec( sub { rand &gt 0.5 } );
	}

	1;

DESCRIPTION
       File::Find::Rule went down so well with the buying public that everyone
       wanted to add extra features.  With the 0.07 release this became a
       possibility, using the following conventions.

   Declare your package
	package File::Find::Rule::Random;
	use strict;

   Inherit methods from File::Find::Rule
	# take useful things from File::Find::Rule
	use base 'File::Find::Rule';

       Force your madness into the main package

	# and force our crack into the main namespace
	sub File::Find::Rule::random () {
	    my $self = shift()-&gt_force_object;
	    $self-&gtexec( sub { rand &gt 0.5 } );
	}

       Yes, we're being very cavalier here and defining things into the main
       File::Find::Rule namespace.  This is due to lack of imaginiation on my
       part - I simply can't find a way for the functional and oo interface to
       work without doing this or some kind of inheritance, and inheritance
       stops you using two File::Find::Rule::Foo modules together.

       For this reason try and pick distinct names for your extensions.  If
       this becomes a problem then I may institute a semi-official registry of
       taken names.

   Taking no arguments.
       Note the null prototype on random.  This is a cheat for the procedural
       interface to know that your sub takes no arguments, and so allows this
       to happen:

	find( random =&gt in =&gt '.' );

       If you hadn't declared "random" with a null prototype it would have
       consumed "in" as a parameter to it, then got all confused as it doesn't
       know about a '.' rule.

       File::Find::Rule::MMagic was the first extension module, so maybe check
       that out.
