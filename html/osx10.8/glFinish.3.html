NAME
       glFinish - block until all GL execution is complete


C SPECIFICATION
       void glFinish( void )


DESCRIPTION
       glFinish  does not return until the effects of all previously called GL
       commands are complete.  Such effects include all changes to  GL	state,
       all  changes  to  connection state, and all changes to the frame buffer
       contents.

NOTES
       glFinish requires a round trip to the server.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if glFinish is executed  between  the
       execution of glBegin and the corresponding execution of glEnd.

SEE ALSO
       glFlush
