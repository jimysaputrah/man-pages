NAME
       dblink_build_sql_delete - builds a DELETE statement using supplied
       values for primary key field values

SYNOPSIS
       dblink_build_sql_delete(text relname,
			       int2vector primary_key_attnums,
			       integer num_primary_key_atts,
			       text[] tgt_pk_att_vals_array) returns text

DESCRIPTION
       dblink_build_sql_delete can be useful in doing selective replication of
       a local table to a remote database. It builds a SQL DELETE command that
       will delete the row with the given primary key values.

ARGUMENTS
       relname
	   Name of a local relation, for example foo or myschema.mytab.
	   Include double quotes if the name is mixed-case or contains special
	   characters, for example "FooBar"; without quotes, the string will
	   be folded to lower case.

       primary_key_attnums
	   Attribute numbers (1-based) of the primary key fields, for example
	   1 2.

       num_primary_key_atts
	   The number of primary key fields.

       tgt_pk_att_vals_array
	   Values of the primary key fields to be used in the resulting DELETE
	   command. Each field is represented in text form.

RETURN VALUE
       Returns the requested SQL statement as text.

NOTES
       As of PostgreSQL 9.0, the attribute numbers in primary_key_attnums are
       interpreted as logical column numbers, corresponding to the column's
       position in SELECT * FROM relname. Previous versions interpreted the
       numbers as physical column positions. There is a difference if any
       column(s) to the left of the indicated column have been dropped during
       the lifetime of the table.

EXAMPLES
	   SELECT dblink_build_sql_delete('"MyFoo"', '1 2', 2, '{"1", "b"}');
		      dblink_build_sql_delete
	   ---------------------------------------------
	    DELETE FROM "MyFoo" WHERE f1='1' AND f2='b'
	   (1 row)
