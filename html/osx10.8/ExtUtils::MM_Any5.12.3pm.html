NAME
       ExtUtils::MM_Any - Platform-agnostic MM methods

SYNOPSIS
	 FOR INTERNAL USE ONLY!

	 package ExtUtils::MM_SomeOS;

	 # Temporarily, you have to subclass both.  Put MM_Any first.
	 require ExtUtils::MM_Any;
	 require ExtUtils::MM_Unix;
	 @ISA = qw(ExtUtils::MM_Any ExtUtils::Unix);

DESCRIPTION
       FOR INTERNAL USE ONLY!

       ExtUtils::MM_Any is a superclass for the ExtUtils::MM_* set of modules.
       It contains methods which are either inherently cross-platform or are
       written in a cross-platform manner.

       Subclass off of ExtUtils::MM_Any and ExtUtils::MM_Unix.	This is a
       temporary solution.

       THIS MAY BE TEMPORARY!

METHODS
       Any methods marked Abstract must be implemented by subclasses.

   Cross-platform helper methods
       These are methods which help writing cross-platform code.

       os_flavor  Abstract

	   my @os_flavor = $mm->os_flavor;

       @os_flavor is the style of operating system this is, usually
       corresponding to the MM_*.pm file we're using.

       The first element of @os_flavor is the major family (ie. Unix, Windows,
       VMS, OS/2, etc...) and the rest are sub families.

       Some examples:

	   Cygwin98	  ('Unix',  'Cygwin', 'Cygwin9x')
	   Windows	  ('Win32')
	   Win98	  ('Win32', 'Win9x')
	   Linux	  ('Unix',  'Linux')
	   MacOS X	  ('Unix',  'Darwin', 'MacOS', 'MacOS X')
	   OS/2 	  ('OS/2')

       This is used to write code for styles of operating system.  See
       os_flavor_is() for use.

       os_flavor_is

	   my $is_this_flavor = $mm->os_flavor_is($this_flavor);
	   my $is_this_flavor = $mm->os_flavor_is(@one_of_these_flavors);

       Checks to see if the current operating system is one of the given
       flavors.

       This is useful for code like:

	   if( $mm->os_flavor_is('Unix') ) {
	       $out = `foo 2>&1`;
	   }
	   else {
	       $out = `foo`;
	   }

       can_load_xs

	   my $can_load_xs = $self->can_load_xs;

       Returns true if we have the ability to load XS.

       This is important because miniperl, used to build XS modules in the
       core, can not load XS.

       split_command

	   my @cmds = $MM->split_command($cmd, @args);

       Most OS have a maximum command length they can execute at once.	Large
       modules can easily generate commands well past that limit.  Its
       necessary to split long commands up into a series of shorter commands.

       "split_command" will return a series of @cmds each processing part of
       the args.  Collectively they will process all the arguments.  Each
       individual line in @cmds will not be longer than the
       $self->max_exec_len being careful to take into account macro expansion.

       $cmd should include any switches and repeated initial arguments.

       If no @args are given, no @cmds will be returned.

       Pairs of arguments will always be preserved in a single command, this
       is a heuristic for things like pm_to_blib and pod2man which work on
       pairs of arguments.  This makes things like this safe:

	   $self->split_command($cmd, %pod2man);

       echo

	   my @commands = $MM->echo($text);
	   my @commands = $MM->echo($text, $file);
	   my @commands = $MM->echo($text, $file, $appending);

       Generates a set of @commands which print the $text to a $file.

       If $file is not given, output goes to STDOUT.

       If $appending is true the $file will be appended to rather than
       overwritten.

       wraplist

	 my $args = $mm->wraplist(@list);

       Takes an array of items and turns them into a well-formatted list of
       arguments.  In most cases this is simply something like:

	   FOO \
	   BAR \
	   BAZ

       maketext_filter

	   my $filter_make_text = $mm->maketext_filter($make_text);

       The text of the Makefile is run through this method before writing to
       disk.  It allows systems a chance to make portability fixes to the
       Makefile.

       By default it does nothing.

       This method is protected and not intended to be called outside of
       MakeMaker.

       cd  Abstract

	 my $subdir_cmd = $MM->cd($subdir, @cmds);

       This will generate a make fragment which runs the @cmds in the given
       $dir.  The rough equivalent to this, except cross platform.

	 cd $subdir && $cmd

       Currently $dir can only go down one level.  "foo" is fine.  "foo/bar"
       is not.	"../foo" is right out.

       The resulting $subdir_cmd has no leading tab nor trailing newline.
       This makes it easier to embed in a make string.	For example.

	     my $make = sprintf <<'CODE', $subdir_cmd;
	 foo :
	     $(ECHO) what
	     %s
	     $(ECHO) mouche
	 CODE

       oneliner  Abstract

	 my $oneliner = $MM->oneliner($perl_code);
	 my $oneliner = $MM->oneliner($perl_code, \@switches);

       This will generate a perl one-liner safe for the particular platform
       you're on based on the given $perl_code and @switches (a -e is assumed)
       suitable for using in a make target.  It will use the proper shell
       quoting and escapes.

       $(PERLRUN) will be used as perl.

       Any newlines in $perl_code will be escaped.  Leading and trailing
       newlines will be stripped.  Makes this idiom much easier:

	   my $code = $MM->oneliner(<<'CODE', [...switches...]);
       some code here
       another line here
       CODE

       Usage might be something like:

	   # an echo emulation
	   $oneliner = $MM->oneliner('print "Foo\n"');
	   $make = '$oneliner > somefile';

       All dollar signs must be doubled in the $perl_code if you expect them
       to be interpreted normally, otherwise it will be considered a make
       macro.  Also remember to quote make macros else it might be used as a
       bareword.  For example:

	   # Assign the value of the $(VERSION_FROM) make macro to $vf.
	   $oneliner = $MM->oneliner('$$vf = "$(VERSION_FROM)"');

       Its currently very simple and may be expanded sometime in the figure to
       include more flexible code and switches.

       quote_literal  Abstract

	   my $safe_text = $MM->quote_literal($text);

       This will quote $text so it is interpreted literally in the shell.

       For example, on Unix this would escape any single-quotes in $text and
       put single-quotes around the whole thing.

       escape_newlines	Abstract

	   my $escaped_text = $MM->escape_newlines($text);

       Shell escapes newlines in $text.

       max_exec_len  Abstract

	   my $max_exec_len = $MM->max_exec_len;

       Calculates the maximum command size the OS can exec.  Effectively, this
       is the max size of a shell command line.

       make

	   my $make = $MM->make;

       Returns the make variant we're generating the Makefile for.  This
       attempts to do some normalization on the information from %Config or
       the user.

   Targets
       These are methods which produce make targets.

       all_target

       Generate the default target 'all'.

       blibdirs_target

	   my $make_frag = $mm->blibdirs_target;

       Creates the blibdirs target which creates all the directories we use in
       blib/.

       The blibdirs.ts target is deprecated.  Depend on blibdirs instead.

       clean (o)

       Defines the clean target.

       clean_subdirs_target

	 my $make_frag = $MM->clean_subdirs_target;

       Returns the clean_subdirs target.  This is used by the clean target to
       call clean on any subdirectories which contain Makefiles.

       dir_target

	   my $make_frag = $mm->dir_target(@directories);

       Generates targets to create the specified directories and set its
       permission to PERM_DIR.

       Because depending on a directory to just ensure it exists doesn't work
       too well (the modified time changes too often) dir_target() creates a
       .exists file in the created directory.  It is this you should depend
       on.  For portability purposes you should use the $(DIRFILESEP) macro
       rather than a '/' to seperate the directory from the file.

	   yourdirectory$(DIRFILESEP).exists

       distdir

       Defines the scratch directory target that will hold the distribution
       before tar-ing (or shar-ing).

       dist_test

       Defines a target that produces the distribution in the
       scratchdirectory, and runs 'perl Makefile.PL; make ;make test' in that
       subdirectory.

       dynamic (o)

       Defines the dynamic target.

       makemakerdflt_target

	 my $make_frag = $mm->makemakerdflt_target

       Returns a make fragment with the makemakerdeflt_target specified.  This
       target is the first target in the Makefile, is the default target and
       simply points off to 'all' just in case any make variant gets confused
       or something gets snuck in before the real 'all' target.

       manifypods_target

	 my $manifypods_target = $self->manifypods_target;

       Generates the manifypods target.  This target generates man pages from
       all POD files in MAN1PODS and MAN3PODS.

       metafile_target

	   my $target = $mm->metafile_target;

       Generate the metafile target.

       Writes the file META.yml YAML encoded meta-data about the module in the
       distdir.  The format follows Module::Build's as closely as possible.

       metafile_data

	   my @metadata_pairs = $mm->metafile_data(\%meta_add, \%meta_merge);

       Returns the data which MakeMaker turns into the META.yml file.

       Values of %meta_add will overwrite any existing metadata in those keys.
       %meta_merge will be merged with them.

       metafile_file

	   my $meta_yml = $mm->metafile_file(@metadata_pairs);

       Turns the @metadata_pairs into YAML.

       This method does not implement a complete YAML dumper, being limited to
       dump a hash with values which are strings, undef's or nested hashes and
       arrays of strings. No quoting/escaping is done.

       distmeta_target

	   my $make_frag = $mm->distmeta_target;

       Generates the distmeta target to add META.yml to the MANIFEST in the
       distdir.

       realclean (o)

       Defines the realclean target.

       realclean_subdirs_target

	 my $make_frag = $MM->realclean_subdirs_target;

       Returns the realclean_subdirs target.  This is used by the realclean
       target to call realclean on any subdirectories which contain Makefiles.

       signature_target

	   my $target = $mm->signature_target;

       Generate the signature target.

       Writes the file SIGNATURE with "cpansign -s".

       distsignature_target

	   my $make_frag = $mm->distsignature_target;

       Generates the distsignature target to add SIGNATURE to the MANIFEST in
       the distdir.

       special_targets

	 my $make_frag = $mm->special_targets

       Returns a make fragment containing any targets which have special
       meaning to make.  For example, .SUFFIXES and .PHONY.

   Init methods
       Methods which help initialize the MakeMaker object and macros.

       init_ABSTRACT

	   $mm->init_ABSTRACT

       init_INST

	   $mm->init_INST;

       Called by init_main.  Sets up all INST_* variables except those related
       to XS code.  Those are handled in init_xs.

       init_INSTALL

	   $mm->init_INSTALL;

       Called by init_main.  Sets up all INSTALL_* variables (except
       INSTALLDIRS) and *PREFIX.

       init_INSTALL_from_PREFIX

	 $mm->init_INSTALL_from_PREFIX;

       init_from_INSTALL_BASE

	   $mm->init_from_INSTALL_BASE

       init_VERSION  Abstract

	   $mm->init_VERSION

       Initialize macros representing versions of MakeMaker and other tools

       MAKEMAKER: path to the MakeMaker module.

       MM_VERSION: ExtUtils::MakeMaker Version

       MM_REVISION: ExtUtils::MakeMaker version control revision (for
       backwards
		    compat)

       VERSION: version of your module

       VERSION_MACRO: which macro represents the version (usually 'VERSION')

       VERSION_SYM: like version but safe for use as an RCS revision number

       DEFINE_VERSION: -D line to set the module version when compiling

       XS_VERSION: version in your .xs file.  Defaults to $(VERSION)

       XS_VERSION_MACRO: which macro represents the XS version.

       XS_DEFINE_VERSION: -D line to set the xs version when compiling.

       Called by init_main.

       init_others

	   $MM->init_others();

       Initializes the macro definitions used by tools_other() and places them
       in the $MM object.

       If there is no description, its the same as the parameter to
       WriteMakefile() documented in ExtUtils::MakeMaker.

       Defines at least these macros.

	 Macro		   Description

	 NOOP		   Do nothing
	 NOECHO 	   Tell make not to display the command itself

	 MAKEFILE
	 FIRST_MAKEFILE
	 MAKEFILE_OLD
	 MAKE_APERL_FILE   File used by MAKE_APERL

	 SHELL		   Program used to run shell commands

	 ECHO		   Print text adding a newline on the end
	 RM_F		   Remove a file
	 RM_RF		   Remove a directory
	 TOUCH		   Update a file's timestamp
	 TEST_F 	   Test for a file's existence
	 CP		   Copy a file
	 MV		   Move a file
	 CHMOD		   Change permissions on a file
	 FALSE		   Exit with non-zero
	 TRUE		   Exit with zero

	 UMASK_NULL	   Nullify umask
	 DEV_NULL	   Suppress all command output

       tools_other

	   my $make_frag = $MM->tools_other;

       Returns a make fragment containing definitions for the macros
       init_others() initializes.

       init_DIRFILESEP	Abstract

	 $MM->init_DIRFILESEP;
	 my $dirfilesep = $MM->{DIRFILESEP};

       Initializes the DIRFILESEP macro which is the seperator between the
       directory and filename in a filepath.  ie. / on Unix, \ on Win32 and
       nothing on VMS.

       For example:

	   # instead of $(INST_ARCHAUTODIR)/extralibs.ld
	   $(INST_ARCHAUTODIR)$(DIRFILESEP)extralibs.ld

       Something of a hack but it prevents a lot of code duplication between
       MM_* variants.

       Do not use this as a seperator between directories.  Some operating
       systems use different seperators between subdirectories as between
       directories and filenames (for example:	VOLUME:[dir1.dir2]file on
       VMS).

       init_linker  Abstract

	   $mm->init_linker;

       Initialize macros which have to do with linking.

       PERL_ARCHIVE: path to libperl.a equivalent to be linked to dynamic
       extensions.

       PERL_ARCHIVE_AFTER: path to a library which should be put on the linker
       command line after the external libraries to be linked to dynamic
       extensions.  This may be needed if the linker is one-pass, and Perl
       includes some overrides for C RTL functions, such as malloc().

       EXPORT_LIST: name of a file that is passed to linker to define symbols
       to be exported.

       Some OSes do not need these in which case leave it blank.

       init_platform

	   $mm->init_platform

       Initialize any macros which are for platform specific use only.

       A typical one is the version number of your OS specific mocule.	(ie.
       MM_Unix_VERSION or MM_VMS_VERSION).

       init_MAKE

	   $mm->init_MAKE

       Initialize MAKE from either a MAKE environment variable or
       $Config{make}.

   Tools
       A grab bag of methods to generate specific macros and commands.

       manifypods

       Defines targets and routines to translate the pods into manpages and
       put them into the INST_* directories.

       POD2MAN_macro

	 my $pod2man_macro = $self->POD2MAN_macro

       Returns a definition for the POD2MAN macro.  This is a program which
       emulates the pod2man utility.  You can add more switches to the command
       by simply appending them on the macro.

       Typical usage:

	   $(POD2MAN) --section=3 --perm_rw=$(PERM_RW) podfile1 man_page1 ...

       test_via_harness

	 my $command = $mm->test_via_harness($perl, $tests);

       Returns a $command line which runs the given set of $tests with
       Test::Harness and the given $perl.

       Used on the t/*.t files.

       test_via_script

	 my $command = $mm->test_via_script($perl, $script);

       Returns a $command line which just runs a single test without
       Test::Harness.  No checks are done on the results, they're just
       printed.

       Used for test.pl, since they don't always follow Test::Harness
       formatting.

       tool_autosplit

       Defines a simple perl call that runs autosplit. May be deprecated by
       pm_to_blib soon.

       arch_check

	   my $arch_ok = $mm->arch_check(
	       $INC{"Config.pm"},
	       File::Spec->catfile($Config{archlibexp}, "Config.pm")
	   );

       A sanity check that what Perl thinks the architecture is and what
       Config thinks the architecture is are the same.	If they're not it will
       return false and show a diagnostic message.

       When building Perl it will always return true, as nothing is installed
       yet.

       The interface is a bit odd because this is the result of a quick
       refactoring.  Don't rely on it.

   File::Spec wrappers
       ExtUtils::MM_Any is a subclass of File::Spec.  The methods noted here
       override File::Spec.

       catfile

       File::Spec <= 0.83 has a bug where the file part of catfile is not
       canonicalized.  This override fixes that bug.

   Misc
       Methods I can't really figure out where they should go yet.

       find_tests

	 my $test = $mm->find_tests;

       Returns a string suitable for feeding to the shell to return all tests
       in t/*.t.

       extra_clean_files

	   my @files_to_clean = $MM->extra_clean_files;

       Returns a list of OS specific files to be removed in the clean target
       in addition to the usual set.

       installvars

	   my @installvars = $mm->installvars;

       A list of all the INSTALL* variables without the INSTALL prefix.
       Useful for iteration or building related variable sets.

       libscan

	 my $wanted = $self->libscan($path);

       Takes a path to a file or dir and returns an empty string if we don't
       want to include this file in the library.  Otherwise it returns the the
       $path unchanged.

       Mainly used to exclude version control administrative directories from
       installation.

       platform_constants

	   my $make_frag = $mm->platform_constants

       Returns a make fragment defining all the macros initialized in
       init_platform() rather than put them in constants().
