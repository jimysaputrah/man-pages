ATRUN(8)		  BSD System Manager's Manual		      ATRUN(8)

NAME
     atrun -- run jobs queued for later execution

SYOPSIS
     atrun

DESCRIPTION
     The atrun utility runs commands queued by at(1).  It is invoked periodi-
     cally by launchd(8) as specified in the com.apple.atrun.plist property
     list.  By default the property list contains the Disabled key set to
     true, so atrun is never invoked.

     Execute the following command as root to enable atrun:
	   launchctl load -w
	   /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.atrun.plist

FILES
     /var/at/jobs      Directory containing job files
     /var/at/spool     Directory containing output spool files
     /var/at/lockfile  Job-creation lock file.

SEE ALSO
     at(1), launchd(8)
