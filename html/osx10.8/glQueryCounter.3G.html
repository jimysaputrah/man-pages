GLQUERYCOUNTER(3G)		  OpenGL 3.3		    GLQUERYCOUNTER(3G)



NAME
       glQueryCounter - record the GL time into a query object after all
       previous commands have reached the GL server but have not yet
       necessarily executed.

C SPECIFICATION
       void glQueryCounter(GLuint id, GLenum target);

PARAMETERS
       id
	   Specify the name of a query object into which to record the GL
	   time.

       target
	   Specify the counter to query.  target must be GL_TIMESTAMP.

DESCRIPTION
       glQueryCounter causes the GL to record the current time into the query
       object named id.  target must be GL_TIMESTAMP. The time is recorded
       after all previous commands on the GL client and server state and the
       framebuffer have been fully realized. When the time is recorded, the
       query result for that object is marked available.  glQueryCounter timer
       queries can be used within a glBeginQuery() / glEndQuery() block where
       the target is GL_TIME_ELAPSED and it does not affect the result of that
       query object.

NOTES
       glQueryCounter is available only if the GL version is 3.3 or higher.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if id is the name of a query object
       that is already in use within a glBeginQuery() / glEndQuery() block.


       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if id is not the name of a query object
       returned from a previous call to glGenQueries().


       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if target is not GL_TIMESTAMP.
