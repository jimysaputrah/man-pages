NAME
       SSL_CIPHER_get_name, SSL_CIPHER_get_bits, SSL_CIPHER_get_version,
       SSL_CIPHER_description - get SSL_CIPHER properties

SYNOPSIS
	#include &ltopenssl/ssl.h&gt

	const char *SSL_CIPHER_get_name(const SSL_CIPHER *cipher);
	int SSL_CIPHER_get_bits(const SSL_CIPHER *cipher, int *alg_bits);
	char *SSL_CIPHER_get_version(const SSL_CIPHER *cipher);
	char *SSL_CIPHER_description(const SSL_CIPHER *cipher, char *buf, int size);

DESCRIPTION
       SSL_CIPHER_get_name() returns a pointer to the name of cipher. If the
       argument is the NULL pointer, a pointer to the constant value "NONE" is
       returned.

       SSL_CIPHER_get_bits() returns the number of secret bits used for
       cipher. If alg_bits is not NULL, it contains the number of bits
       processed by the chosen algorithm. If cipher is NULL, 0 is returned.

       SSL_CIPHER_get_version() returns the protocol version for cipher,
       currently "SSLv2", "SSLv3", or "TLSv1". If cipher is NULL, "(NONE)" is
       returned.

       SSL_CIPHER_description() returns a textual description of the cipher
       used into the buffer buf of length len provided. len must be at least
       128 bytes, otherwise a pointer to the string "Buffer too small" is
       returned. If buf is NULL, a buffer of 128 bytes is allocated using
       OPENSSL_malloc(). If the allocation fails, a pointer to the string
       "OPENSSL_malloc Error" is returned.

NOTES
       The number of bits processed can be different from the secret bits. An
       export cipher like e.g. EXP-RC4-MD5 has only 40 secret bits. The
       algorithm does use the full 128 bits (which would be returned for
       alg_bits), of which however 88bits are fixed. The search space is hence
       only 40 bits.

       The string returned by SSL_CIPHER_description() in case of success
       consists of cleartext information separated by one or more blanks in
       the following sequence:

       &ltciphername&gt
	   Textual representation of the cipher name.

       &ltprotocol version&gt
	   Protocol version: SSLv2, SSLv3. The TLSv1 ciphers are flagged with
	   SSLv3.

       Kx=&ltkey exchange&gt
	   Key exchange method: RSA (for export ciphers as RSA(512) or
	   RSA(1024)), DH (for export ciphers as DH(512) or DH(1024)), DH/RSA,
	   DH/DSS, Fortezza.

       Au=&ltauthentication&gt
	   Authentication method: RSA, DSS, DH, None. None is the
	   representation of anonymous ciphers.

       Enc=&ltsymmetric encryption method&gt
	   Encryption method with number of secret bits: DES(40), DES(56),
	   3DES(168), RC4(40), RC4(56), RC4(64), RC4(128), RC2(40), RC2(56),
	   RC2(128), IDEA(128), Fortezza, None.

       Mac=&ltmessage authentication code&gt
	   Message digest: MD5, SHA1.

       &ltexport flag&gt
	   If the cipher is flagged exportable with respect to old US crypto
	   regulations, the word "export" is printed.

EXAMPLES
       Some examples for the output of SSL_CIPHER_description():

	EDH-RSA-DES-CBC3-SHA	SSLv3 Kx=DH	  Au=RSA  Enc=3DES(168) Mac=SHA1
	EDH-DSS-DES-CBC3-SHA	SSLv3 Kx=DH	  Au=DSS  Enc=3DES(168) Mac=SHA1
	RC4-MD5 		SSLv3 Kx=RSA	  Au=RSA  Enc=RC4(128)	Mac=MD5
	EXP-RC4-MD5		SSLv3 Kx=RSA(512) Au=RSA  Enc=RC4(40)	Mac=MD5  export

BUGS
       If SSL_CIPHER_description() is called with cipher being NULL, the
       library crashes.

       If SSL_CIPHER_description() cannot handle a built-in cipher, the
       according description of the cipher property is unknown. This case
       should not occur.
