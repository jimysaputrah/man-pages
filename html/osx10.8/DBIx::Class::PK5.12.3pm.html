NAME
       DBIx::Class::PK - Primary Key class

SYNOPSIS
DESCRIPTION
       This class contains methods for handling primary keys and methods
       depending on them.

METHODS
   id
       Returns the primary key(s) for a row. Can't be called as a class
       method.

   ID
       Returns a unique id string identifying a row object by primary key.
       Used by DBIx::Class::CDBICompat::LiveObjectIndex and
       DBIx::Class::ObjectCache.

       WARNING
	   The default "_create_ID" method used by this function orders the
	   returned values by the alphabetical order of the primary column
	   names, unlike the "id" method, which follows the same order in
	   which columns were fed to "set_primary_key" in
	   DBIx::Class::ResultSource.

   ident_condition
	 my $cond = $result_source-&gtident_condition();

	 my $cond = $result_source-&gtident_condition('alias');

       Produces a condition hash to locate a row based on the primary key(s).
