NAME
	   DBIx::Class::Serialize::Storable - hooks for Storable nfreeze/thaw

DEPRECATION NOTE
       This component is now DEPRECATED. It has not been providing any useful
       functionality for quite a while, and in fact destroys prefetched
       results in its current implementation. Do not use!

SYNOPSIS
	   # in a table class definition
	   __PACKAGE__-&gtload_components(qw/Serialize::Storable/);

	   # meanwhile, in a nearby piece of code
	   my $cd = $schema-&gtresultset('CD')-&gtfind(12);
	   # if the cache uses Storable, this will work automatically
	   $cache-&gtset($cd-&gtID, $cd);

DESCRIPTION
       This component adds hooks for Storable so that row objects can be
       serialized. It assumes that your row object class ("result_class") is
       the same as your table class, which is the normal situation.

HOOKS
       The following hooks are defined for Storable - see the documentation
       for "Hooks" in Storable for detailed information on these hooks.

   STORABLE_freeze
       The serializing hook, called on the object during serialization. It can
       be inherited, or defined in the class itself, like any other method.

   STORABLE_thaw
       The deserializing hook called on the object during deserialization.
