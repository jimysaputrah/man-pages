NAME
       XML::XPath::PerlSAX - A PerlSAX event generator for my wierd node
       structure

SYNOPSIS
	       use XML::XPath;
	       use XML::XPath::PerlSAX;
	       use XML::DOM::PerlSAX;

	       my $xp = XML::XPath->new(filename => 'test.xhtml');
	       my $paras = $xp->find('/html/body/p');

	       my $handler = XML::DOM::PerlSAX->new();
	       my $generator = XML::XPath::PerlSAX->new( Handler => $handler );

	       foreach my $node ($paras->get_nodelist) {
		       my $domtree = $generator->parse($node);
		       # do something with $domtree
	       }

DESCRIPTION
       This module generates PerlSAX events to pass to a PerlSAX handler such
       as XML::DOM::PerlSAX. It operates specifically on my wierd tree format.

       Unfortunately SAX doesn't seem to cope with namespaces, so these are
       lost completely. I believe SAX2 is doing namespaces.

Other
       The XML::DOM::PerlSAX handler I tried was completely broken (didn't
       even compile before I patched it a bit), so I don't know how correct
       this is or how far it will work.

       This software may only be distributed as part of the XML::XPath
       package.
