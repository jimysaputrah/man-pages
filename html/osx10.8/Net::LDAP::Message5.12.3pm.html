NAME
       Net::LDAP::Message - Message response from LDAP server

SYNOPSIS
	use Net::LDAP;

DESCRIPTION
       Net::LDAP::Message is a base class for the objects returned by the
       Net::LDAP methods abandon, add, bind, compare, delete, modify, moddn,
       search and unbind.

       The sub-class Net::LDAP::Search returned by search also defines many
       methods.

       If the Net::LDAP object is in async mode then all these methods, except
       "done" and "mesg_id", will cause a wait until the request is completed.

METHODS
       code ( )
	   The code value in the result message from the server. Normally for
	   a success zero will be returned. Constants for the result codes can
	   be imported from the Net::LDAP or Net::LDAP::Constant module.

       control ( )
	   Return a list of controls that were returned from the server.

       control ( OID, ... )

       error_name ( )
	   Returns the name of the error code in the result message from the
	   server. See ldap_error_name for a detailed description of the
	   return value.

       error_text ( )

	   message from the server. See ldap_error_text for a detailed
	   description of the return value.

	   Returns a long text description of the error code in the result
	   message from the server. See ldap_error_desc for a detailed
	   description of the return value.

       is_error ( )
	   Returns true if the result code is considered to be an error for
	   the operation.

       mesg_id ( )

	   Returns a list of referrals from the result message.
