PTHREAD_RWLOCK_INIT(3)	 BSD Library Functions Manual	PTHREAD_RWLOCK_INIT(3)

NAME
     pthread_rwlock_init -- initialize a read/write lock

SYNOPSIS
     #include <pthread.h>

     int
     pthread_rwlock_init(pthread_rwlock_t *restrict rwlock,
	 const pthread_rwlockattr_t *restrict attr);

DESCRIPTION
     The pthread_rwlock_init() function is used to initialize a read/write
     lock, with attributes specified by attr.  If attr is NULL, the default
     read/write lock attributes are used.

     The results of calling pthread_rwlock_init() with an already initialized
     lock are undefined.

RETURN VALUES
     If successful, the pthread_rwlock_init() function will return zero.  Oth-
     erwise, an error number will be returned to indicate the error.

SEE ALSO
     pthread_rwlock_destroy(3), pthread_rwlockattr_init(3),
     pthread_rwlockattr_setpshared(3)

STANDARDS
     The pthread_rwlock_init() function is expected to conform to Version 2 of
     the Single UNIX Specification (``SUSv2'').

ERRORS
     The pthread_rwlock_init() function will fail if:

     [EAGAIN]		The system lacked the necessary resources (other than
			memory) to initialize the lock.

     [ENOMEM]		Insufficient memory exists to initialize the lock.

     [EPERM]		The caller does not have sufficient privilege to per-
			form the operation.

     The pthread_rwlock_init() function may fail if:

     [EBUSY]		The system has detected an attempt to re-initialize
			the object referenced by rwlock, a previously initial-
			ized but not yet destroyed read/write lock.

     [EINVAL]		The value specified by attr is invalid.

HISTORY
     The pthread_rwlock_init() function first appeared in FreeBSD 3.0.

BUGS
     The PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED attribute is not supported.
