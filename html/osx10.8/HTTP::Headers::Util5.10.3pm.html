NAME
       HTTP::Headers::Util - Header value parsing utility functions

SYNOPSIS
	 use HTTP::Headers::Util qw(split_header_words);
	 @values = split_header_words($h-&gtheader("Content-Type"));

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides a few functions that helps parsing and
       construction of valid HTTP header values.  None of the functions are
       exported by default.

       The following functions are available:

       split_header_words( @header_values )
	   This function will parse the header values given as argument into a
	   list of anonymous arrays containing key/value pairs.  The function
	   knows how to deal with ",", ";" and "=" as well as quoted values
	   after "=".  A list of space separated tokens are parsed as if they
	   were separated by ";".

	   If the @header_values passed as argument contains multiple values,
	   then they are treated as if they were a single value separated by
	   comma ",".

	   This means that this function is useful for parsing header fields
	   that follow this syntax (BNF as from the HTTP/1.1 specification,
	   but we relax the requirement for tokens).

	     headers	       = #header
	     header	       = (token | parameter) *( [";"] (token | parameter))

	     token	       = 1*&ltany CHAR except CTLs or separators&gt
	     separators        = "(" | ")" | "&lt" | "&gt" | "@"
			       | "," | ";" | ":" | "\" | &lt"&gt
			       | "/" | "[" | "]" | "?" | "="
			       | "{" | "}" | SP | HT

	     quoted-string     = ( &lt"&gt *(qdtext | quoted-pair ) &lt"&gt )
	     qdtext	       = &ltany TEXT except &lt"&gt&gt
	     quoted-pair       = "\" CHAR

	     parameter	       = attribute "=" value
	     attribute	       = token
	     value	       = token | quoted-string

	   Each header is represented by an anonymous array of key/value
	   pairs.  The keys will be all be forced to lower case.  The value
	   for a simple token (not part of a parameter) is "undef".
	   Syntactically incorrect headers will not necessary be parsed as you
	   would want.

	   This is easier to describe with some examples:

	      split_header_words('foo="bar"; port="80,81"; DISCARD, BAR=baz');
	      split_header_words('text/html; charset="iso-8859-1"');
	      split_header_words('Basic realm="\\"foo\\\\bar\\""');

	   will return

	      [foo=&gt'bar', port=&gt'80,81', discard=&gt undef], [bar=&gt'baz' ]
	      ['text/html' =&gt undef, charset =&gt 'iso-8859-1']
	      [basic =&gt undef, realm =&gt "\"foo\\bar\""]

	   If you don't want the function to convert tokens and attribute keys
	   to lower case you can call it as "_split_header_words" instead
	   (with a leading underscore).

       join_header_words( @arrays )
	   This will do the opposite of the conversion done by
	   split_header_words().  It takes a list of anonymous arrays as
	   arguments (or a list of key/value pairs) and produces a single
	   header value.  Attribute values are quoted if needed.

	   Example:

	      join_header_words(["text/plain" =&gt undef, charset =&gt "iso-8859/1"]);
	      join_header_words("text/plain" =&gt undef, charset =&gt "iso-8859/1");

	   will both return the string:

	      text/plain; charset="iso-8859/1"
