NAME
       loads.d - print load averages. Uses DTrace.

SYNOPSIS
       loads.d

DESCRIPTION
       These are the same load averages that the "uptime" command prints.  The
       purpose of this script is to demonstrate fetching these values from the
       DTrace language.

       The  first  field  is the 1 minute average, the second is the 5 minute,
       and the third is the 15 minute average. The value represents the  aver-
       age  number of runnable threads in the system, a value higher than your
       CPU (core/hwthread) count may be a sign of CPU saturation.

       Since this uses DTrace, only users with root privileges	can  run  this
       command.

EXAMPLES
       Print load averages,
	      # loads.d


DOCUMENTATION
       See  the  DTraceToolkit for further documentation under the Docs direc-
       tory. The DTraceToolkit docs may include full worked examples with ver-
       bose descriptions explaining the output.
