NAME
       ALTER_TEXT_SEARCH_DICTIONARY - change the definition of a text search
       dictionary

SYNOPSIS
       ALTER TEXT SEARCH DICTIONARY name (
	   option [ = value ] [, ... ]
       )
       ALTER TEXT SEARCH DICTIONARY name RENAME TO new_name
       ALTER TEXT SEARCH DICTIONARY name OWNER TO new_owner
       ALTER TEXT SEARCH DICTIONARY name SET SCHEMA new_schema

DESCRIPTION
       ALTER TEXT SEARCH DICTIONARY changes the definition of a text search
       dictionary. You can change the dictionary's template-specific options,
       or change the dictionary's name or owner.

       You must be the owner of the dictionary to use ALTER TEXT SEARCH
       DICTIONARY.

PARAMETERS
       name
	   The name (optionally schema-qualified) of an existing text search
	   dictionary.

       option
	   The name of a template-specific option to be set for this
	   dictionary.

       value
	   The new value to use for a template-specific option. If the equal
	   sign and value are omitted, then any previous setting for the
	   option is removed from the dictionary, allowing the default to be
	   used.

       new_name
	   The new name of the text search dictionary.

       new_owner
	   The new owner of the text search dictionary.

       new_schema
	   The new schema for the text search dictionary.

       Template-specific options can appear in any order.

EXAMPLES
       The following example command changes the stopword list for a
       Snowball-based dictionary. Other parameters remain unchanged.

	   ALTER TEXT SEARCH DICTIONARY my_dict ( StopWords = newrussian );

       The following example command changes the language option to dutch, and
       removes the stopword option entirely.

	   ALTER TEXT SEARCH DICTIONARY my_dict ( language = dutch, StopWords );

       The following example command "updates" the dictionary's definition
       without actually changing anything.

	   ALTER TEXT SEARCH DICTIONARY my_dict ( dummy );

       (The reason this works is that the option removal code doesn't complain
       if there is no such option.) This trick is useful when changing
       configuration files for the dictionary: the ALTER will force existing
       database sessions to re-read the configuration files, which otherwise
       they would never do if they had read them earlier.

COMPATIBILITY
       There is no ALTER TEXT SEARCH DICTIONARY statement in the SQL standard.
