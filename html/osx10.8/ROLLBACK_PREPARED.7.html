NAME
       ROLLBACK_PREPARED - cancel a transaction that was earlier prepared for
       two-phase commit

SYNOPSIS
       ROLLBACK PREPARED transaction_id

DESCRIPTION
       ROLLBACK PREPARED rolls back a transaction that is in prepared state.

PARAMETERS
       transaction_id
	   The transaction identifier of the transaction that is to be rolled
	   back.

NOTES
       To roll back a prepared transaction, you must be either the same user
       that executed the transaction originally, or a superuser. But you do
       not have to be in the same session that executed the transaction.

       This command cannot be executed inside a transaction block. The
       prepared transaction is rolled back immediately.

       All currently available prepared transactions are listed in the
       pg_prepared_xacts system view.

EXAMPLES
       Roll back the transaction identified by the transaction identifier
       foobar:

	   ROLLBACK PREPARED 'foobar';
