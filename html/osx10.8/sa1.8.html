NAME
     sa1 -- Generate a system activity daily data file.

SYNOPSIS
     /usr/lib/sa/sa1 [t n]

DESCRIPTION
     The sa1 command is a shell script used to invoke the system activity data
     collector, sadc.  The binary sample data is collected at intervals t sec-
     onds apart, in a loop n times.  The binary sample data is written to the
     standard daily data file, /var/log/sa/sadd where the dd represents the
     current day of the month.

     sa1 is intended to be started by cron.

EXAMPLE CRON ENTRY
     # Starting at 8am collect system activity records
     # every 20 minutes for 12 hours
     # 20 minutes = 1200 seconds
     # 12 hours with 3 samples each hour = 36 loops

     0 8 * * 1-5 /usr/lib/sa/sa1 1200 36


     # After the 12 hour period,
     # collect a system activity report

     30 20 * * 1-5 /usr/lib/sa/sa2 -A


FILES
     /var/log/sa/sadd  Default daily activity file that holds the binary sam-
		       pling data.  dd are digits that represent the day of
		       the month.
