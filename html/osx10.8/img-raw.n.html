NAME
       img-raw - Img, Raw Data Format (raw)

SYNOPSIS
       package require Tk

       package require img::raw  ?1.4?

       image create photo ?name? ?options?

_________________________________________________________________

DESCRIPTION
       The  package  img::raw  is  a sub-package of Img. It can be loaded as a
       part of the complete Img support, via package require Img,  or  on  its
       own, via package require img::raw.

       Like  all packages of Img it does not provide new commands, but extends
       the existing Tk command image so  that  it  supports  files  containing
       raster  images in the Raw Data Format (raw). More specifically img::raw
       extends Tk's photo image type.

       The name of the new format handler is raw.  This handler  provides  new
       additional  configuration  options.  See  section  RAW OPTIONS for more
       detailed explanations.

       All of the above means that in a call like

       image create photo ?name? ?options?


       [1]    Image data in raw format (options -data and -file)  is  detected
	      automatically.

       [2]    The  format  name  raw  is recognized by the option -format.  In
	      addition the value for the option is treated  as	list  and  may
	      contain  any  of	the  special  options  listed  in  section RAW
	      OPTIONS.


NOTE
       This format handler must be  loaded  explicitly	with  package  require
       img::raw.

SUPPORTED RAW TYPES
	Grayscale image:  1 channel  of 32-bit floating point	values.
			  1 channel  of 16-bit unsigned integer values.
			  1 channel  of  8-bit unsigned integer values.
	True-color image: 3 channels of 32-bit floating point	values.
			  3 channels of 16-bit unsigned integer values.
			  3 channels of  8-bit unsigned integer values.

	List of currently supported features:

	Type   |     Read      |     Write     |
	       | -file | -data | -file | -data |
	----------------------------------------
	Gray   | Yes   | Yes   | Yes   | Yes   |
	RGB    | Yes   | Yes   | Yes   | Yes   |

	There are 2 supported file formats:
	One with the pure raw data only, the other with a 7 line ASCII header
	of the following form:

	    Magic=RAW\n 	 File format identifier. Fixed value.
	    Width=128\n 	 Image width in pixels.
	    Height=128\n	 Image height in pixels.
	    NumChan=1\n 	 Possible values: 1 or 3.
	    ByteOrder=Intel\n	 Possible values: "Intel" or "Motorola".
	    ScanOrder=TopDown\n  Possible values: "TopDown" or "BottomUp".
	    PixelType=byte\n	 Possible values: "float", "short" or "byte".



RAW OPTIONS
       The handler provides the following options:

       -verbose bool
	      This option is supported for reading and writing.

	      If  set  to true, additional information about the loaded/stored
	      image is printed to stdout. Default is false.

       -useheader bool
	      This option is supported for reading and writing.

	      If set to true, use the file header information for reading  and
	      writing.	Default is true.

       -nchan int
	      This  option  is	supported  for	reading and writing image data
	      without header.

	      Specify the number of channels of the input image.   Default  is
	      1.

       -width int
	      This  option  is supported for reading image data without header
	      only.

	      Specify the width of the input image.  Default is 128.

       -height int
	      This option is supported for reading image data  without	header
	      only.

	      Specify the height of the input image.  Default is 128.

       -byteorder string
	      This  option  is supported for reading image data without header
	      only.

	      Specify the byteorder of the input image data.  Possible values:
	      Intel  or  Motorola.   Default is assuming the same byteorder as
	      that of the host computer.

       -uuencode bool
	      This option is supported for reading image data  without	header
	      only.

	      If  set to false, do not assume, that the image data stored in a
	      Tcl variable is uuencoded. Default is true, i.e. the image  data
	      in a Tcl variable is assumed to be uuencoded.

       -scanorder string
	      This  option  is	supported  for	reading and writing image data
	      without header.

	      Specify the scanline order of the input image.  Possible values:
	      TopDown  or BottomUp.  Default is assuming the same byteorder as
	      that of the host computer.

       -pixeltype string
	      This option is supported for reading image data  without	header
	      only.

	      Specify the type of the pixel values.  Possible values: float or
	      short or byte.  Default is byte.

	      RAW files are always written in byte pixel format.

       -gamma float
	      This option is supported for reading only.

	      Specify a gamma correction to be applied when mapping the  input
	      data to 8-bit image values.  Default is 1.0.

       -nomap bool
	      This option is supported for reading only.

	      If  set  to  true, no mapping of input values is done.  Use this
	      option, if your image already contains RGB values in  the  range
	      of 0 .. 255.  Default is false.

       -min float
	      This option is supported for reading only.

	      Specify the minimum pixel value to be used for mapping the input
	      data to 8-bit image values.  Default is the minimum value  found
	      in the image data.

       -max float
	      This option is supported for reading only.

	      Specify the maximum pixel value to be used for mapping the input
	      data to 8-bit image values.  Default is the maximum value  found
	      in the image data.
