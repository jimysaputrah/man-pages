NAME
       Class::MOP::Package - Package Meta Object

DESCRIPTION
       The Package Protocol provides an abstraction of a Perl 5 package. A
       package is basically namespace, and this module provides methods for
       looking at and changing that namespace's symbol table.

METHODS
       Class::MOP::Package-&gtinitialize($package_name)
	   This method creates a new "Class::MOP::Package" instance which
	   represents specified package. If an existing metaclass object
	   exists for the package, that will be returned instead.

       Class::MOP::Package-&gtreinitialize($package)
	   This method forcibly removes any existing metaclass for the package
	   before calling "initialize". In contrast to "initialize", you may
	   also pass an existing "Class::MOP::Package" instance instead of
	   just a package name as $package.

	   Do not call this unless you know what you are doing.

       $metapackage-&gtname
	   This is returns the package's name, as passed to the constructor.

       $metapackage-&gtnamespace
	   This returns a hash reference to the package's symbol table. The
	   keys are symbol names and the values are typeglob references.

       $metapackage-&gtadd_package_symbol($variable_name, $initial_value)
	   This method accepts a variable name and an optional initial value.
	   The $variable_name must contain a leading sigil.

	   This method creates the variable in the package's symbol table, and
	   sets it to the initial value if one was provided.

       $metapackage-&gtget_package_symbol($variable_name)
	   Given a variable name, this method returns the variable as a
	   reference or undef if it does not exist. The $variable_name must
	   contain a leading sigil.

       $metapackage-&gthas_package_symbol($variable_name)
	   Returns true if there is a package variable defined for
	   $variable_name. The $variable_name must contain a leading sigil.

       $metapackage-&gtremove_package_symbol($variable_name)
	   This will remove the package variable specified $variable_name. The
	   $variable_name must contain a leading sigil.

       $metapackage-&gtremove_package_glob($glob_name)
	   Given the name of a glob, this will remove that glob from the
	   package's symbol table. Glob names do not include a sigil. Removing
	   the glob removes all variables and subroutines with the specified
	   name.

       $metapackage-&gtlist_all_package_symbols($type_filter)
	   This will list all the glob names associated with the current
	   package. These names do not have leading sigils.

	   You can provide an optional type filter, which should be one of
	   'SCALAR', 'ARRAY', 'HASH', or 'CODE'.

       $metapackage-&gtget_all_package_symbols($type_filter)
	   This works much like "list_all_package_symbols", but it returns a
	   hash reference. The keys are glob names and the values are
	   references to the value for that name.

   Method introspection and creation
       These methods allow you to introspect a class's methods, as well as
       add, remove, or change methods.

       Determining what is truly a method in a Perl 5 class requires some
       heuristics (aka guessing).

       Methods defined outside the package with a fully qualified name ("sub
       Package::name { ... }") will be included. Similarly, methods named with
       a fully qualified name using Sub::Name are also included.

       However, we attempt to ignore imported functions.

       Ultimately, we are using heuristics to determine what truly is a method
       in a class, and these heuristics may get the wrong answer in some edge
       cases. However, for most "normal" cases the heuristics work correctly.

       $metapackage-&gtget_method($method_name)
	   This will return a Class::MOP::Method for the specified
	   $method_name. If the class does not have the specified method, it
	   returns "undef"

       $metapackage-&gthas_method($method_name)
	   Returns a boolean indicating whether or not the class defines the
	   named method. It does not include methods inherited from parent
	   classes.

       $metapackage-&gtget_method_list
	   This will return a list of method names for all methods defined in
	   this class.

       $metapackage-&gtadd_method($method_name, $method)
	   This method takes a method name and a subroutine reference, and
	   adds the method to the class.

	   The subroutine reference can be a Class::MOP::Method, and you are
	   strongly encouraged to pass a meta method object instead of a code
	   reference. If you do so, that object gets stored as part of the
	   class's method map directly. If not, the meta information will have
	   to be recreated later, and may be incorrect.

	   If you provide a method object, this method will clone that object
	   if the object's package name does not match the class name. This
	   lets us track the original source of any methods added from other
	   classes (notably Moose roles).

       $metapackage-&gtremove_method($method_name)
	   Remove the named method from the class. This method returns the
	   Class::MOP::Method object for the method.

       $metapackage-&gtmethod_metaclass
	   Returns the class name of the method metaclass, see
	   Class::MOP::Method for more information on the method metaclass.

       $metapackage-&gtwrapped_method_metaclass
	   Returns the class name of the wrapped method metaclass, see
	   Class::MOP::Method::Wrapped for more information on the wrapped
	   method metaclass.

       Class::MOP::Package-&gtmeta
	   This will return a Class::MOP::Class instance for this class.
