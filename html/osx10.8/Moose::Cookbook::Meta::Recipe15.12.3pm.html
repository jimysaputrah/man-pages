Moose::Cookbook::Meta:UseriContributed Perl DMoose::Cookbook::Meta::Recipe1(3)



NAME
       Moose::Cookbook::Meta::Recipe1 - Welcome to the meta world (Why Go
       Meta?)

VERSION
       version 2.0205

SUMMARY
       You might want to read Moose::Manual::MOP if you haven't done so yet.

       If you've ever thought "Moose is great, but I wish it did X
       differently", then you've gone meta. The meta recipes demonstrate how
       to change and extend the way Moose works by extending and overriding
       how the meta classes (Moose::Meta::Class, Moose::Meta::Attribute, etc)
       work.

       The metaclass API is a set of classes that describe classes, roles,
       attributes, etc. The metaclass API lets you ask questions about a
       class, like "what attributes does it have?", or "what roles does the
       class do?"

       The metaclass system also lets you make changes to a class, for example
       by adding new methods or attributes.

       The interface presented by Moose.pm ("has", "with", "extends") is just
       a thin layer of syntactic sugar over the underlying metaclass system.

       By extending and changing how this metaclass system works, you can
       create your own Moose variant.

   Examples
       Let's say that you want to add additional properties to attributes.
       Specifically, we want to add a "label" property to each attribute, so
       we can write "My::Class-&gtmeta()-&gtget_attribute('size')-&gtlabel()". The
       first two recipes show two different ways to do this, one with a full
       meta-attribute subclass, and the other with an attribute trait.

       You might also want to add additional properties to your metaclass. For
       example, if you were writing an ORM based on Moose, you could associate
       a table name with each class via the class's metaclass object, letting
       you write "My::Class-&gtmeta()-&gttable_name()".

SEE ALSO
       Many of the MooseX modules on CPAN implement metaclass extensions. A
       couple good examples include MooseX::Singleton and
       MooseX::AttributeHelpers. For a more complex example see Fey::ORM or
       Reaction.
