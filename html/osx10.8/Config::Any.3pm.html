NAME
       Config::Any - Load configuration from different file formats,
       transparently

SYNOPSIS
	   use Config::Any;

	   my $cfg = Config::Any-&gtload_stems({stems =&gt \@filepath_stems, ... });
	   # or
	   my $cfg = Config::Any-&gtload_files({files =&gt \@filepaths, ... });

	   for (@$cfg) {
	       my ($filename, $config) = %$_;
	       $class-&gtconfig($config);
	       warn "loaded config from file: $filename";
	   }

DESCRIPTION
       Config::Any provides a facility for Perl applications and libraries to
       load configuration data from multiple different file formats. It
       supports XML, YAML, JSON, Apache-style configuration, Windows INI
       files, and even Perl code.

       The rationale for this module is as follows: Perl programs are deployed
       on many different platforms and integrated with many different systems.
       Systems administrators and end users may prefer different configuration
       formats than the developers. The flexibility inherent in a multiple
       format configuration loader allows different users to make different
       choices, without generating extra work for the developers. As a
       developer you only need to learn a single interface to be able to use
       the power of different configuration formats.

INTERFACE
   load_files( \%args )
	   Config::Any-&gtload_files( { files =&gt \@files } );
	   Config::Any-&gtload_files( { files =&gt \@files, filter	=&gt \&filter } );
	   Config::Any-&gtload_files( { files =&gt \@files, use_ext =&gt 1 } );
	   Config::Any-&gtload_files( { files =&gt \@files, flatten_to_hash =&gt 1 } );

       "load_files()" attempts to load configuration from the list of files
       passed in the "files" parameter, if the file exists.

       If the "filter" parameter is set, it is used as a callback to modify
       the configuration data before it is returned. It will be passed a
       single hash-reference parameter which it should modify in-place.

       If the "use_ext" parameter is defined, the loader will attempt to parse
       the file extension from each filename and will skip the file unless it
       matches a standard extension for the loading plugins. Only plugins
       whose standard extensions match the file extension will be used. For
       efficiency reasons, its use is encouraged, but be aware that you will
       lose flexibility -- for example, a file called "myapp.cfg" containing
       YAML data will not be offered to the YAML plugin, whereas "myapp.yml"
       or "myapp.yaml" would be.

       When the "flatten_to_hash" parameter is defined, the loader will return
       a hash keyed on the file names, as opposed to the usual list of single-
       key hashes.

       "load_files()" also supports a 'force_plugins' parameter, whose value
       should be an arrayref of plugin names like "Config::Any::INI". Its
       intended use is to allow the use of a non-standard file extension while
       forcing it to be offered to a particular parser.  It is not compatible
       with 'use_ext'.

       You can supply a "driver_args" hashref to pass special options to a
       particular parser object. Example:

	   Config::Any-&gtload_files( { files =&gt \@files, driver_args =&gt {
	       General =&gt { -LowerCaseNames =&gt 1 }
	   } )

   load_stems( \%args )
	   Config::Any-&gtload_stems( { stems =&gt \@stems } );
	   Config::Any-&gtload_stems( { stems =&gt \@stems, filter	=&gt \&filter } );
	   Config::Any-&gtload_stems( { stems =&gt \@stems, use_ext =&gt 1 } );
	   Config::Any-&gtload_stems( { stems =&gt \@stems, flatten_to_hash =&gt 1 } );

       "load_stems()" attempts to load configuration from a list of files
       which it generates by combining the filename stems list passed in the
       "stems" parameter with the potential filename extensions from each
       loader, which you can check with the "extensions()" classmethod
       described below. Once this list of possible filenames is built it is
       treated exactly as in "load_files()" above, as which it takes the same
       parameters. Please read the "load_files()" documentation before using
       this method.

   finder( )
       The "finder()" classmethod returns the Module::Pluggable::Object object
       which is used to load the plugins. See the documentation for that
       module for more information.

   plugins( )
       The "plugins()" classmethod returns the names of configuration loading
       plugins as found by Module::Pluggable::Object.

   extensions( )
       The "extensions()" classmethod returns the possible file extensions
       which can be loaded by "load_stems()" and "load_files()". This may be
       useful if you set the "use_ext" parameter to those methods.

DIAGNOSTICS
       "No files specified!" or "No stems specified!"
	   The "load_files()" and "load_stems()" methods will issue this
	   warning if called with an empty list of files/stems to load.

       "_load requires a arrayref of file paths"
	   This fatal error will be thrown by the internal "_load" method. It
	   should not occur but is specified here for completeness. If your
	   code dies with this error, please email a failing test case to the
	   authors below.
