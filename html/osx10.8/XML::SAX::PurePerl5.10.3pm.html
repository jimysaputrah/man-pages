NAME
       XML::SAX::PurePerl - Pure Perl XML Parser with SAX2 interface

SYNOPSIS
	 use XML::Handler::Foo;
	 use XML::SAX::PurePerl;
	 my $handler = XML::Handler::Foo->new();
	 my $parser = XML::SAX::PurePerl->new(Handler => $handler);
	 $parser->parse_uri("myfile.xml");

DESCRIPTION
       This module implements an XML parser in pure perl. It is written around
       the upcoming perl 5.8's unicode support and support for multiple
       document encodings (using the PerlIO layer), however it has been ported
       to work with ASCII/UTF8 documents under lower perl versions.

       The SAX2 API is described in detail at
       http://sourceforge.net/projects/perl-xml/, in the CVS archive, under
       libxml-perl/docs. Hopefully those documents will be in a better
       location soon.

       Please refer to the SAX2 documentation for how to use this module - it
       is merely a front end to SAX2, and implements nothing that is not in
       that spec (or at least tries not to - please email me if you find
       errors in this implementation).

BUGS
       XML::SAX::PurePerl is slow. Very slow. I suggest you use something else
       in fact. However it is great as a fallback parser for XML::SAX, where
       the user might not be able to install an XS based parser or C library.

       Currently lots, probably. At the moment the weakest area is parsing
       DOCTYPE declarations, though the code is in place to start doing this.
       Also parsing parameter entity references is causing me much confusion,
       since it's not exactly what I would call trivial, or well documented in
       the XML grammar. XML documents with internal subsets are likely to
       fail.

       I am however trying to work towards full conformance using the Oasis
       test suite.
