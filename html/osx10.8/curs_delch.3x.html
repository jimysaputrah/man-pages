NAME
       delch, wdelch, mvdelch, mvwdelch - delete character under the cursor in
       a curses window

SYNOPSIS
       #include &ltcurses.h&gt

       int delch(void);
       int wdelch(WINDOW *win);
       int mvdelch(int y, int x);
       int mvwdelch(WINDOW *win, int y, int x);

DESCRIPTION
       These routines delete the character under the cursor; all characters to
       the  right  of  the  cursor  on the same line are moved to the left one
       position and the last character on the line is  filled  with  a	blank.
       The  cursor  position  does not change (after moving to y, x, if speci-
       fied).  (This does not imply use of the hardware delete character  fea-
       ture.)

RETURN VALUE
       All routines return the integer ERR upon failure and an OK (SVr4 speci-
       fies only "an integer value other than ERR")  upon  successful  comple-
       tion.

NOTES
       Note that delch, mvdelch, and mvwdelch may be macros.

PORTABILITY
       These functions are described in the XSI Curses standard, Issue 4.  The
       standard specifies that they return ERR on failure,  but  specifies  no
       error conditions.
