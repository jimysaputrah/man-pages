PTHREAD_CANCEL(3)	 BSD Library Functions Manual	     PTHREAD_CANCEL(3)

NAME
     pthread_cancel -- cancel execution of a thread

SYNOPSIS
     #include <pthread.h>

     int
     pthread_cancel(pthread_t thread);

DESCRIPTION
     The pthread_cancel() function requests that thread be canceled.  The tar-
     get thread's cancelability state and type determines when the cancella-
     tion takes effect.  When the cancellation is acted on, the cancellation
     cleanup handlers for thread are called.  When the last cancellation
     cleanup handler returns, the thread-specific data destructor functions
     will be called for thread.  When the last destructor function returns,
     thread will be terminated.

     The cancellation processing in the target thread runs asynchronously with
     respect to the calling thread returning from pthread_cancel().

     A status of PTHREAD_CANCELED is made available to any threads joining
     with the target.  The symbolic constant PTHREAD_CANCELED expands to a
     constant expression of type (void *), whose value matches no pointer to
     an object in memory nor the value NULL.

RETURN VALUES
     If successful,  the pthread_cancel() functions will return zero.  Other-
     wise an error number will be returned to indicate the error.

ERRORS
     pthread_cancel() will fail if:

     [ESRCH]		No thread could be found corresponding to that speci-
			fied by the given thread ID.
