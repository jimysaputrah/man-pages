NAME
       curl_easy_recv - receives raw data on an "easy" connection

SYNOPSIS
       #include &ltcurl/easy.h&gt

       CURLcode  curl_easy_recv(  CURL	*curl,	void  *buffer,	size_t buflen,
       size_t *n);

DESCRIPTION
       This function receives raw data from the  established  connection.  You
       may  use  it together with curl_easy_send(3) to implement custom proto-
       cols using libcurl. This functionality can be  particularly  useful  if
       you  use proxies and/or SSL encryption: libcurl will take care of proxy
       negotiation and connection set-up.

       buffer is a pointer to your buffer that will  get  the  received  data.
       buflen  is  the	maximum amount of data you can get in that buffer. The
       variable n points to will receive the number of received bytes.

       To establish the connection,  set  CURLOPT_CONNECT_ONLY	option	before
       calling curl_easy_perform(3). Note that curl_easy_recv(3) does not work
       on connections that were created without this option.

       You must ensure that  the  socket  has  data  to  read  before  calling
       curl_easy_recv(3),  otherwise  the  call  will return CURLE_AGAIN - the
       socket is used in  non-blocking	mode  internally.  Use	curl_easy_get-
       info(3) with CURLINFO_LASTSOCKET to obtain the socket; use your operat-
       ing system facilities like select(2) to check if it has	any  data  you
       can read.

AVAILABILITY
       Added in 7.18.2.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, returns CURLE_OK, stores the received data into buffer, and
       the number of bytes it actually read into *n.

       On failure, returns the appropriate error code.

       If there is no data to read, the function returns CURLE_AGAIN. Use your
       operating system facilities to wait until the data is ready, and retry.

EXAMPLE
       See sendrecv.c in docs/examples directory for usage example.
