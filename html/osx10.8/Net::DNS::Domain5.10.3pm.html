NAME
	   Net::DNS::Domain - Domain Name System domains

SYNOPSIS
	   use Net::DNS::Domain

DESCRIPTION
       The "Net::DNS::Domain" module implements a class of abstract DNS domain
       objects with associated class and instance methods.

       Each domain object instance represents a single DNS domain which has a
       fixed identity throughout its lifetime.

       Internally, the primary representation is a (possibly empty) list of
       ASCII domain labels, and optional link to an ancestor domain object
       topologically closer to the root of the DNS namespace.

       The presentation form of the domain name is generated on demand and the
       result cached within the object.

METHODS
   new
	   $domain = new Net::DNS::Domain('example.com');

       Creates a domain object which represents the DNS domain identified by
       the character string argument.  The identifier consists of a sequence
       of labels delimited by dots.

       The argument string consists of printable characters from the 7-bit
       ASCII repertoire.

       A character preceded by \ represents itself, without any special
       interpretation.

       Any 8-bit code point can be represented by \ followed by exactly three
       decimal digits.	Character code points are ASCII, irrespective of the
       encoding employed by the underlying platform.  No characters are
       associated with code points beyond 127.

       Argument strings should be delimited by single quotes to avoid escape
       sequences being misinterpreted by the compiler.

       The character string presentation format follows the conventions for
       zone files described in RFC1035.

   decode
	   $domain = decode Net::DNS::Domain( \$buffer, $offset, $hash );

	   ( $domain, $next ) = decode Net::DNS::Domain( \$buffer, $offset, $hash );

       Creates a domain object which represents the DNS domain identified by
       the compressed name at the indicated offset within the data buffer.

       The argument list consists of a reference to a scalar containing the
       wire-format data, specified offset and reference to a hash used to
       represent compressed names.

       The returned offset value indicates the start of the next item in the
       data buffer.

   encode
	   $data = $domain->encode( $offset, $hash );

       Returns the wire-format representation of the domain object suitable
       for inclusion in a DNS packet buffer.

       The optional arguments are the offset within the packet data where the
       domain name is to be stored and a reference to a hash table used to
       index compressed names within the packet.

   name
	   $name = $domain->name;

       Returns a character string corresponding to the "typical" form of
       domain name to which section 11 of RFC2181 alludes.

       The string consists of printable characters from the 7-bit ASCII
       repertoire.  Code points outside this set are represented by the
       appropriate numerical escape sequence.

   mailbox
	   $mail = $domain->mailbox;

       Returns a character string containing the mailbox interpretation of the
       domain name as described in RFC1035 section 8.

   string
	   $fqdn = $domain->string;

       Returns a character string containing the absolute name of the domain
       as described in RFC1035 section 5.1.

       The string consists of printable characters from the 7-bit ASCII
       repertoire.  Code points outside this set are represented by the
       appropriate numerical escape sequence.

       Characters which have special meaning in a zone file, dots which are
       part of a domain label, and the escape character itself are represented
       by escape sequences which remove any such meaning.

BUGS
       Platform-specific parts of the code are designed to be optimised away
       by the compiler for reasons of efficiency. This is achieved at
       considerable expense in terms of readability.
