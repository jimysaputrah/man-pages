       glGenLists - generate a contiguous set of empty display lists


C SPECIFICATION
       GLuint glGenLists( GLsizei range )


PARAMETERS
       range  Specifies  the  number  of  contiguous empty display lists to be

       glGenLists has one argument, range.  It returns an integer n such  that
       range  contiguous  empty  display lists, named n, n+1, ..., n+range -1,
       are created.  If range is 0, if there is no group of  range  contiguous
       names  available,  or  if  any error is generated, no display lists are
       generated, and 0 is returned.
