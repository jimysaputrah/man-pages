DESCRIPTION
       This module provides a Perl interface that allows writing zip
       compressed data to files or buffer.

       The primary purpose of this module is to provide streaming write access
       to zip files and buffers. It is not a general-purpose file archiver. If
       that is what you want, check out "Archive::Zip".

       At present three compression methods are supported by
       IO::Compress::Zip, namely Store (no compression at all), Deflate and
       Bzip2.

       Note that to create Bzip2 content, the module "IO::Compress::Bzip2"
       must be installed.

       For reading zip files/buffers, see the companion module
       IO::Uncompress::Unzip.

Functional Interface
       A top-level function, "zip", is provided to carry out "one-shot"
       compression between buffers and/or files. For finer control over the
       compression process, see the "OO Interface" section.

	   use IO::Compress::Zip qw(zip $ZipError) ;

	   zip $input => $output [,OPTS]
	       or die "zip failed: $ZipError\n";

       The functional interface needs Perl5.005 or better.

   zip $input => $output [, OPTS]
       "zip" expects at least two parameters, $input and $output.

       The $input parameter

       The parameter, $input, is used to define the source of the uncompressed
       data.

       It can take one of the following forms:

       A filename
	    If the $input parameter is a simple scalar, it is assumed to be a
	    filename. This file will be opened for reading and the input data
	    will be read from it.

       A filehandle
	    If the $input parameter is a filehandle, the input data will be
	    read from it.  The string '-' can be used as an alias for standard
	    input.

       A scalar reference
	    If $input is a scalar reference, the input data will be read from
	    $$input.

       An array reference
	    If $input is an array reference, each element in the array must be
	    a filename.

	    The input data will be read from each file in turn.

	    The complete array will be walked to ensure that it only contains
	    valid filenames before any data is compressed.

       An Input FileGlob string
	    If $input is a string that is delimited by the characters "<" and
	    ">" "zip" will assume that it is an input fileglob string. The
	    input is the list of files that match the fileglob.

	    If the fileglob does not match any files ...

	    See File::GlobMapper for more details.

       If the $input parameter is any other type, "undef" will be returned.

       In addition, if $input is a simple filename, the default values for the
       "Name", "Time", "ExtAttr" and "exTime" options will be sourced from
       that file.

       If you do not want to use these defaults they can be overridden by
       explicitly setting the "Name", "Time", "ExtAttr" and "exTime" options
       or by setting the "Minimal" parameter.

       The $output parameter

       The parameter $output is used to control the destination of the
       compressed data. This parameter can take one of these forms.

       A filename
	    If the $output parameter is a simple scalar, it is assumed to be a
	    filename.  This file will be opened for writing and the compressed
	    data will be written to it.

       A filehandle
	    If the $output parameter is a filehandle, the compressed data will
	    be written to it.  The string '-' can be used as an alias for
	    standard output.

       A scalar reference
	    If $output is a scalar reference, the compressed data will be
	    stored in $$output.

       An Array Reference
	    If $output is an array reference, the compressed data will be
	    pushed onto the array.

       An Output FileGlob
	    If $output is a string that is delimited by the characters "<" and
	    ">" "zip" will assume that it is an output fileglob string. The
	    output is the list of files that match the fileglob.

	    When $output is an fileglob string, $input must also be a fileglob
	    string. Anything else is an error.

       If the $output parameter is any other type, "undef" will be returned.

   Notes
       When $input maps to multiple files/buffers and $output is a single
       file/buffer the input files/buffers will each be stored in $output as a
       distinct entry.

   Optional Parameters
       Unless specified below, the optional parameters for "zip", "OPTS", are
       the same as those used with the OO interface defined in the
       "Constructor Options" section below.

       "AutoClose => 0|1"
	    This option applies to any input or output data streams to "zip"
	    that are filehandles.

	    If "AutoClose" is specified, and the value is true, it will result
	    in all input and/or output filehandles being closed once "zip" has
	    completed.

	    This parameter defaults to 0.

       "BinModeIn => 0|1"
	    When reading from a file or filehandle, set "binmode" before
	    reading.

	    Defaults to 0.

       "Append => 0|1"
	    TODO

   Examples
       To read the contents of the file "file1.txt" and write the compressed
       data to the file "file1.txt.zip".

	   use strict ;
	   use warnings ;
	   use IO::Compress::Zip qw(zip $ZipError) ;

	   my $input = "file1.txt";
	   zip $input => "$input.zip"
	       or die "zip failed: $ZipError\n";

       To read from an existing Perl filehandle, $input, and write the
       compressed data to a buffer, $buffer.

	   use strict ;
	   use warnings ;
	   use IO::Compress::Zip qw(zip $ZipError) ;
	   use IO::File ;

	   my $input = new IO::File "<file1.txt"
	       or die "Cannot open 'file1.txt': $!\n" ;
	   my $buffer ;
	   zip $input => \$buffer
	       or die "zip failed: $ZipError\n";

       To compress all files in the directory "/my/home" that match "*.txt"
       and store the compressed data in the same directory

	   use strict ;
	   use warnings ;
	   use IO::Compress::Zip qw(zip $ZipError) ;

	   zip '</my/home/*.txt>' => '<*.zip>'
	       or die "zip failed: $ZipError\n";

       and if you want to compress each file one at a time, this will do the
       trick

	   use strict ;
	   use warnings ;
	   use IO::Compress::Zip qw(zip $ZipError) ;

	   for my $input ( glob "/my/home/*.txt" )
	   {
	       my $output = "$input.zip" ;
	       zip $input => $output
		   or die "Error compressing '$input': $ZipError\n";
	   }

OO Interface
   Constructor
       The format of the constructor for "IO::Compress::Zip" is shown below

	   my $z = new IO::Compress::Zip $output [,OPTS]
	       or die "IO::Compress::Zip failed: $ZipError\n";

       It returns an "IO::Compress::Zip" object on success and undef on
       failure.  The variable $ZipError will contain an error message on
       failure.

       If you are running Perl 5.005 or better the object, $z, returned from
       IO::Compress::Zip can be used exactly like an IO::File filehandle.
       This means that all normal output file operations can be carried out
       with $z.  For example, to write to a compressed file/buffer you can use
       either of these forms

	   $z->print("hello world\n");
	   print $z "hello world\n";

       The mandatory parameter $output is used to control the destination of
       the compressed data. This parameter can take one of these forms.

       A filename
	    If the $output parameter is a simple scalar, it is assumed to be a
	    filename. This file will be opened for writing and the compressed
	    data will be written to it.

       A filehandle
	    If the $output parameter is a filehandle, the compressed data will
	    be written to it.  The string '-' can be used as an alias for
	    standard output.

       A scalar reference
	    If $output is a scalar reference, the compressed data will be
	    stored in $$output.

       If the $output parameter is any other type, "IO::Compress::Zip"::new
       will return undef.

   Constructor Options
       "OPTS" is any combination of the following options:

       "AutoClose => 0|1"
	    This option is only valid when the $output parameter is a
	    filehandle. If specified, and the value is true, it will result in
	    the $output being closed once either the "close" method is called
	    or the "IO::Compress::Zip" object is destroyed.

	    This parameter defaults to 0.

       "Append => 0|1"
	    Opens $output in append mode.

	    The behaviour of this option is dependent on the type of $output.

	    o	 A Buffer

		 If $output is a buffer and "Append" is enabled, all
		 compressed data will be append to the end if $output.
		 Otherwise $output will be cleared before any data is written
		 to it.

	    o	 A Filename

		 If $output is a filename and "Append" is enabled, the file
		 will be opened in append mode. Otherwise the contents of the
		 file, if any, will be truncated before any compressed data is
		 written to it.

	    o	 A Filehandle

		 If $output is a filehandle, the file pointer will be
		 positioned to the end of the file via a call to "seek" before
		 any compressed data is written to it.	Otherwise the file
		 pointer will not be moved.

	    This parameter defaults to 0.

       "Name => $string"
	    Stores the contents of $string in the zip filename header field.
	    If "Name" is not specified, no zip filename field will be created.

       "Time => $number"
	    Sets the last modified time field in the zip header to $number.

	    This field defaults to the time the "IO::Compress::Zip" object was
	    created if this option is not specified.

       "ExtAttr => $attr"
	    This option controls the "external file attributes" field in the
	    central header of the zip file. This is a 4 byte field.

	    If you are running a Unix derivative this value defaults to

		0666 << 16

	    This should allow read/write access to any files that are
	    extracted from the zip file/buffer.

	    For all other systems it defaults to 0.

       "exTime => [$atime, $mtime, $ctime]"
	    This option expects an array reference with exactly three
	    elements: $atime, "mtime" and $ctime. These correspond to the last
	    access time, last modification time and creation time
	    respectively.

	    It uses these values to set the extended timestamp field (ID is
	    "UT") in the local zip header using the three values, $atime,
	    $mtime, $ctime. In addition it sets the extended timestamp field
	    in the central zip header using $mtime.

	    If any of the three values is "undef" that time value will not be
	    used.  So, for example, to set only the $mtime you would use this

		exTime => [undef, $mtime, undef]

	    If the "Minimal" option is set to true, this option will be
	    ignored.

	    By default no extended time field is created.

       "exUnix2 => [$uid, $gid]"
	    This option expects an array reference with exactly two elements:
	    $uid and $gid. These values correspond to the numeric user ID and
	    group ID of the owner of the files respectively.

	    When the "exUnix2" option is present it will trigger the creation
	    of a Unix2 extra field (ID is "Ux") in the local zip. This will be
	    populated with $uid and $gid. In addition an empty Unix2 extra
	    field will also be created in the central zip header

	    If the "Minimal" option is set to true, this option will be
	    ignored.

	    By default no Unix2 extra field is created.

       "Comment => $comment"
	    Stores the contents of $comment in the Central File Header of the
	    zip file.

	    By default, no comment field is written to the zip file.

       "ZipComment => $comment"
	    Stores the contents of $comment in the End of Central Directory
	    record of the zip file.

	    By default, no comment field is written to the zip file.

       "Method => $method"
	    Controls which compression method is used. At present three
	    compression methods are supported, namely Store (no compression at
	    all), Deflate and Bzip2.

	    The symbols, ZIP_CM_STORE, ZIP_CM_DEFLATE and ZIP_CM_BZIP2 are
	    used to select the compression method.

	    These constants are not imported by "IO::Compress::Zip" by
	    default.

		use IO::Compress::Zip qw(:zip_method);
		use IO::Compress::Zip qw(:constants);
		use IO::Compress::Zip qw(:all);

	    Note that to create Bzip2 content, the module
	    "IO::Compress::Bzip2" must be installed. A fatal error will be
	    thrown if you attempt to create Bzip2 content when
	    "IO::Compress::Bzip2" is not available.

	    The default method is ZIP_CM_DEFLATE.

       "Stream => 0|1"
	    This option controls whether the zip file/buffer output is created
	    in streaming mode.

	    Note that when outputting to a file with streaming mode disabled
	    ("Stream" is 0), the output file must be seekable.

	    The default is 1.

       "Zip64 => 0|1"
	    Create a Zip64 zip file/buffer. This option should only be used if
	    you want to store files larger than 4 Gig.

	    If you intend to manipulate the Zip64 zip files created with this
	    module using an external zip/unzip make sure that it supports
	    streaming Zip64.

	    In particular, if you are using Info-Zip you need to have zip
	    version 3.x or better to update a Zip64 archive and unzip version
	    6.x to read a zip64 archive. At the time of writing both are beta
	    status.

	    When the "Zip64" option is enabled, the "Stream" option must be
	    enabled as well.

	    The default is 0.

       "TextFlag => 0|1"
	    This parameter controls the setting of a bit in the zip central
	    header. It is used to signal that the data stored in the zip
	    file/buffer is probably text.

	    The default is 0.

       "ExtraFieldLocal => $data" =item "ExtraFieldCentral => $data"
	    The "ExtraFieldLocal" option is used to store additional metadata
	    in the local header for the zip file/buffer. The
	    "ExtraFieldCentral" does the same for the matching central header.

	    An extra field consists of zero or more subfields. Each subfield
	    consists of a two byte header followed by the subfield data.

	    The list of subfields can be supplied in any of the following
	    formats

		ExtraFieldLocal => [$id1, $data1,
				    $id2, $data2,
				     ...
				   ]

		ExtraFieldLocal => [ [$id1 => $data1],
				     [$id2 => $data2],
				     ...
				   ]

		ExtraFieldLocal => { $id1 => $data1,
				     $id2 => $data2,
				     ...
				   }

	    Where $id1, $id2 are two byte subfield ID's.

	    If you use the hash syntax, you have no control over the order in
	    which the ExtraSubFields are stored, plus you cannot have
	    SubFields with duplicate ID.

	    Alternatively the list of subfields can by supplied as a scalar,
	    thus

		ExtraField => $rawdata

	    The Extended Time field (ID "UT"), set using the "exTime" option,
	    and the Unix2 extra field (ID "Ux), set using the "exUnix2"
	    option, are examples of extra fields.

	    If the "Minimal" option is set to true, this option will be
	    ignored.

	    The maximum size of an extra field 65535 bytes.

       "Minimal => 1|0"
	    If specified, this option will disable the creation of all extra
	    fields in the zip local and central headers. So the "exTime",
	    "exUnix2", "ExtraFieldLocal" and "ExtraFieldCentral" options will
	    be ignored.

	    This parameter defaults to 0.

       "BlockSize100K => number"
	    Specify the number of 100K blocks bzip2 uses during compression.

	    Valid values are from 1 to 9, where 9 is best compression.

	    This option is only valid if the "Method" is ZIP_CM_BZIP2. It is
	    ignored otherwise.

	    The default is 1.

       "WorkFactor => number"
	    Specifies how much effort bzip2 should take before resorting to a
	    slower fallback compression algorithm.

	    Valid values range from 0 to 250, where 0 means use the default
	    value 30.

	    This option is only valid if the "Method" is ZIP_CM_BZIP2. It is
	    ignored otherwise.

	    The default is 0.

       -Level
	    Defines the compression level used by zlib. The value should
	    either be a number between 0 and 9 (0 means no compression and 9
	    is maximum compression), or one of the symbolic constants defined
	    below.

	       Z_NO_COMPRESSION
	       Z_BEST_SPEED
	       Z_BEST_COMPRESSION
	       Z_DEFAULT_COMPRESSION

	    The default is Z_DEFAULT_COMPRESSION.

	    Note, these constants are not imported by "IO::Compress::Zip" by
	    default.

		use IO::Compress::Zip qw(:strategy);
		use IO::Compress::Zip qw(:constants);
		use IO::Compress::Zip qw(:all);

       -Strategy
	    Defines the strategy used to tune the compression. Use one of the
	    symbolic constants defined below.

	       Z_FILTERED
	       Z_HUFFMAN_ONLY
	       Z_RLE
	       Z_FIXED
	       Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY

	    The default is Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY.

       "Strict => 0|1"
	    This is a placeholder option.

   Examples
       TODO

Methods
   print
       Usage is

	   $z->print($data)
	   print $z $data

       Compresses and outputs the contents of the $data parameter. This has
       the same behaviour as the "print" built-in.

       Returns true if successful.

   printf
       Usage is

	   $z->printf($format, $data)
	   printf $z $format, $data

       Compresses and outputs the contents of the $data parameter.

       Returns true if successful.

   syswrite
       Usage is

	   $z->syswrite $data
	   $z->syswrite $data, $length
	   $z->syswrite $data, $length, $offset

       Compresses and outputs the contents of the $data parameter.

       Returns the number of uncompressed bytes written, or "undef" if
       unsuccessful.

   write
       Usage is

	   $z->write $data
	   $z->write $data, $length
	   $z->write $data, $length, $offset

       Compresses and outputs the contents of the $data parameter.

       Returns the number of uncompressed bytes written, or "undef" if
       unsuccessful.

   flush
       Usage is

	   $z->flush;
	   $z->flush($flush_type);

       Flushes any pending compressed data to the output file/buffer.

       This method takes an optional parameter, $flush_type, that controls how
       the flushing will be carried out. By default the $flush_type used is
       "Z_FINISH". Other valid values for $flush_type are "Z_NO_FLUSH",
       "Z_SYNC_FLUSH", "Z_FULL_FLUSH" and "Z_BLOCK". It is strongly
       recommended that you only set the "flush_type" parameter if you fully
       understand the implications of what it does - overuse of "flush" can
       seriously degrade the level of compression achieved. See the "zlib"
       documentation for details.

       Returns true on success.

   tell
       Usage is

	   $z->tell()
	   tell $z

       Returns the uncompressed file offset.

   eof
       Usage is

	   $z->eof();
	   eof($z);

       Returns true if the "close" method has been called.

   seek
	   $z->seek($position, $whence);
	   seek($z, $position, $whence);

       Provides a sub-set of the "seek" functionality, with the restriction
       that it is only legal to seek forward in the output file/buffer.  It is
       a fatal error to attempt to seek backward.

       Empty parts of the file/buffer will have NULL (0x00) bytes written to
       them.

       The $whence parameter takes one the usual values, namely SEEK_SET,
       SEEK_CUR or SEEK_END.

       Returns 1 on success, 0 on failure.

   binmode
       Usage is

	   $z->binmode
	   binmode $z ;

       This is a noop provided for completeness.

   opened
	   $z->opened()

       Returns true if the object currently refers to a opened file/buffer.

   autoflush
	   my $prev = $z->autoflush()
	   my $prev = $z->autoflush(EXPR)

       If the $z object is associated with a file or a filehandle, this method
       returns the current autoflush setting for the underlying filehandle. If
       "EXPR" is present, and is non-zero, it will enable flushing after every
       write/print operation.

       If $z is associated with a buffer, this method has no effect and always
       returns "undef".

       Note that the special variable $| cannot be used to set or retrieve the
       autoflush setting.

   input_line_number
	   $z->input_line_number()
	   $z->input_line_number(EXPR)

       This method always returns "undef" when compressing.

   fileno
	   $z->fileno()
	   fileno($z)

       If the $z object is associated with a file or a filehandle, "fileno"
       will return the underlying file descriptor. Once the "close" method is
       called "fileno" will return "undef".

       If the $z object is is associated with a buffer, this method will
       return "undef".

   close
	   $z->close() ;
	   close $z ;

       Flushes any pending compressed data and then closes the output
       file/buffer.

       For most versions of Perl this method will be automatically invoked if
       the IO::Compress::Zip object is destroyed (either explicitly or by the
       variable with the reference to the object going out of scope). The
       exceptions are Perl versions 5.005 through 5.00504 and 5.8.0. In these
       cases, the "close" method will be called automatically, but not until
       global destruction of all live objects when the program is terminating.

       Therefore, if you want your scripts to be able to run on all versions
       of Perl, you should call "close" explicitly and not rely on automatic
       closing.

       Returns true on success, otherwise 0.

       If the "AutoClose" option has been enabled when the IO::Compress::Zip
       object was created, and the object is associated with a file, the
       underlying file will also be closed.

   newStream([OPTS])
       Usage is

	   $z->newStream( [OPTS] )

       Closes the current compressed data stream and starts a new one.

       OPTS consists of any of the the options that are available when
       creating the $z object.

       See the "Constructor Options" section for more details.

   deflateParams
       Usage is

	   $z->deflateParams

       TODO

Importing
       A number of symbolic constants are required by some methods in
       "IO::Compress::Zip". None are imported by default.

       :all Imports "zip", $ZipError and all symbolic constants that can be
	    used by "IO::Compress::Zip". Same as doing this

		use IO::Compress::Zip qw(zip $ZipError :constants) ;

       :constants
	    Import all symbolic constants. Same as doing this

		use IO::Compress::Zip qw(:flush :level :strategy :zip_method) ;

       :flush
	    These symbolic constants are used by the "flush" method.

		Z_NO_FLUSH
		Z_PARTIAL_FLUSH
		Z_SYNC_FLUSH
		Z_FULL_FLUSH
		Z_FINISH
		Z_BLOCK

       :level
	    These symbolic constants are used by the "Level" option in the
	    constructor.

		Z_NO_COMPRESSION
		Z_BEST_SPEED
		Z_BEST_COMPRESSION
		Z_DEFAULT_COMPRESSION

       :strategy
	    These symbolic constants are used by the "Strategy" option in the
	    constructor.

		Z_FILTERED
		Z_HUFFMAN_ONLY
		Z_RLE
		Z_FIXED
		Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY

       :zip_method
	    These symbolic constants are used by the "Method" option in the
	    constructor.

		ZIP_CM_STORE
		ZIP_CM_DEFLATE
		ZIP_CM_BZIP2
