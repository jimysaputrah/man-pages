NAME
       Tcl_FindExecutable,  Tcl_GetNameOfExecutable  -	identify or return the
       name of the binary file containing the application

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lttcl.h&gt

       void
       Tcl_FindExecutable(argv0)

       const char *
       Tcl_GetNameOfExecutable()

ARGUMENTS
       char *argv0 (in) 	 The first command-line argument to  the  pro-
				 gram, which gives the application's name.

DESCRIPTION
       The  Tcl_FindExecutable	procedure  computes  the full path name of the
       executable file from which the application was invoked and saves it for
       Tcl's  internal	use.  The executable's path name is needed for several
       purposes in Tcl.  For example, it is needed on some  platforms  in  the
       implementation  of  the	load command.  It is also returned by the info
       nameofexecutable command.

       On UNIX platforms this procedure is typically invoked as the very first
       thing  in the application's main program;  it must be passed argv[0] as
       its argument.  It is important not  to  change  the  working  directory
       before  the  invocation.   Tcl_FindExecutable uses argv0 along with the
       PATH environment variable to find the application's executable, if pos-
       sible.  If it fails to find the binary, then future calls to info name-
       ofexecutable will return an empty string.

       Tcl_GetNameOfExecutable simply returns a pointer to the	internal  full
       path  name  of  the  executable file as computed by Tcl_FindExecutable.
       This procedure call is the C API  equivalent  to  the  info  nameofexe-
       cutable	command.   NULL is returned if the internal full path name has
       not been computed or unknown.
