YPPOLL(8)		  BSD System Manager's Manual		     YPPOLL(8)

NAME
     yppoll -- get version of a YP map from YP server

SYNOPSIS
     yppoll [-h host] [-d domainname] mapname

DESCRIPTION
     yppoll is used to get information of a maps order number and master
     server.  This utility is useful when determining if different servers
     have the same version of a map.  yppoll normally talks with the default
     ypserv(8) process, but by using the -h option it is possible to talk with
     a specific server.

     The options are as follows:

     -d domain
	     Don't use default domain, use the specified domain.

     -h host
	     Get map information from host instead of the default YP server.
