NAME
       DBM_Filter::null - filter for DBM_Filter

SYNOPSIS
	   use SDBM_File; # or DB_File, or GDBM_File, or NDBM_File, or ODBM_File
	   use DBM_Filter ;

	   $db = tie %hash, ...
	   $db->Filter_Push('null');

DESCRIPTION
       This filter ensures that all data written to the DBM file is null
       terminated. This is useful when you have a perl script that needs to
       interoperate with a DBM file that a C program also uses. A fairly
       common issue is for the C application to include the terminating null
       in a string when it writes to the DBM file. This filter will ensure
       that all data written to the DBM file can be read by the C application.
