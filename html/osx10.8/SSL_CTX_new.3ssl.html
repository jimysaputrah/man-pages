NAME
       SSL_CTX_new - create a new SSL_CTX object as framework for TLS/SSL
       enabled functions

SYNOPSIS
	#include &ltopenssl/ssl.h&gt

	SSL_CTX *SSL_CTX_new(SSL_METHOD *method);

DESCRIPTION
       SSL_CTX_new() creates a new SSL_CTX object as framework to establish
       TLS/SSL enabled connections.

NOTES
       The SSL_CTX object uses method as connection method. The methods exist
       in a generic type (for client and server use), a server only type, and
       a client only type. method can be of the following types:

       SSLv2_method(void), SSLv2_server_method(void),
       SSLv2_client_method(void)
	   A TLS/SSL connection established with these methods will only
	   understand the SSLv2 protocol. A client will send out SSLv2 client
	   hello messages and will also indicate that it only understand
	   SSLv2. A server will only understand SSLv2 client hello messages.

       SSLv3_method(void), SSLv3_server_method(void),
       SSLv3_client_method(void)
	   A TLS/SSL connection established with these methods will only
	   understand the SSLv3 protocol. A client will send out SSLv3 client
	   hello messages and will indicate that it only understands SSLv3. A
	   server will only understand SSLv3 client hello messages. This
	   especially means, that it will not understand SSLv2 client hello
	   messages which are widely used for compatibility reasons, see
	   SSLv23_*_method().

       TLSv1_method(void), TLSv1_server_method(void),
       TLSv1_client_method(void)
	   A TLS/SSL connection established with these methods will only
	   understand the TLSv1 protocol. A client will send out TLSv1 client
	   hello messages and will indicate that it only understands TLSv1. A
	   server will only understand TLSv1 client hello messages. This
	   especially means, that it will not understand SSLv2 client hello
	   messages which are widely used for compatibility reasons, see
	   SSLv23_*_method(). It will also not understand SSLv3 client hello
	   messages.

       SSLv23_method(void), SSLv23_server_method(void),
       SSLv23_client_method(void)
	   A TLS/SSL connection established with these methods will understand
	   the SSLv2, SSLv3, and TLSv1 protocol. A client will send out SSLv2
	   client hello messages and will indicate that it also understands
	   SSLv3 and TLSv1. A server will understand SSLv2, SSLv3, and TLSv1
	   client hello messages. This is the best choice when compatibility
	   is a concern.

       The list of protocols available can later be limited using the
       SSL_OP_NO_SSLv2, SSL_OP_NO_SSLv3, SSL_OP_NO_TLSv1 options of the
       SSL_CTX_set_options() or SSL_set_options() functions. Using these
       options it is possible to choose e.g. SSLv23_server_method() and be
       able to negotiate with all possible clients, but to only allow newer
       protocols like SSLv3 or TLSv1.

       SSL_CTX_new() initializes the list of ciphers, the session cache
       setting, the callbacks, the keys and certificates, and the options to
       its default values.

RETURN VALUES
       The following return values can occur:

       NULL
	   The creation of a new SSL_CTX object failed. Check the error stack
	   to find out the reason.

       Pointer to an SSL_CTX object
	   The return value points to an allocated SSL_CTX object.
