NAME
       glCheckFramebufferStatus - check the completeness status of a
       framebuffer

C SPECIFICATION
       GLenum glCheckFramebufferStatus(GLenum target);

PARAMETERS
       target
	   Specify the target of the framebuffer completeness check.

DESCRIPTION
       glCheckFramebufferStatus queries the completeness status of the
       framebuffer object currently bound to target.  target must be
       GL_DRAW_FRAMEBUFFER, GL_READ_FRAMEBUFFER or GL_FRAMEBUFFER.
       GL_FRAMEBUFFER is equivalent to GL_DRAW_FRAMEBUFFER.

       The return value is GL_FRAMEBUFFER_COMPLETE if the framebuffer bound to
       target is complete. Otherwise, the return value is determined as
       follows:

       o    GL_FRAMEBUFFER_UNDEFINED is returned if target is the default
	   framebuffer, but the default framebuffer does not exist.

       o    GL_FRAMEBUFFER_INCOMPLETE_ATTACHMENT is returned if any of the
	   framebuffer attachment points are framebuffer incomplete.

       o    GL_FRAMEBUFFER_INCOMPLETE_MISSING_ATTACHMENT is returned if the
	   framebuffer does not have at least one image attached to it.

       o    GL_FRAMEBUFFER_INCOMPLETE_DRAW_BUFFER is returned if the value of
	   GL_FRAMEBUFFER_ATTACHMENT_OBJECT_TYPE is GL_NONE for any color
	   attachment point(s) named by GL_DRAWBUFFERi.

       o    GL_FRAMEBUFFER_INCOMPLETE_READ_BUFFER is returned if
	   GL_READ_BUFFER is not GL_NONE and the value of
	   GL_FRAMEBUFFER_ATTACHMENT_OBJECT_TYPE is GL_NONE for the color
	   attachment point named by GL_READ_BUFFER.

       o    GL_FRAMEBUFFER_UNSUPPORTED is returned if the combination of
	   internal formats of the attached images violates an
	   implementation-dependent set of restrictions.

       o    GL_FRAMEBUFFER_INCOMPLETE_MULTISAMPLE is returned if the value of
	   GL_RENDERBUFFER_SAMPLES is not the same for all attached
	   renderbuffers; if the value of GL_TEXTURE_SAMPLES is the not same
	   for all attached textures; or, if the attached images are a mix of
	   renderbuffers and textures, the value of GL_RENDERBUFFER_SAMPLES
	   does not match the value of GL_TEXTURE_SAMPLES.

       o    GL_FRAMEBUFFER_INCOMPLETE_MULTISAMPLE is also returned if the
	   value of GL_TEXTURE_FIXED_SAMPLE_LOCATIONS is not the same for all
	   attached textures; or, if the attached images are a mix of
	   renderbuffers and textures, the value of
	   GL_TEXTURE_FIXED_SAMPLE_LOCATIONS is not GL_TRUE for all attached
	   textures.

       o    GL_FRAMEBUFFER_INCOMPLETE_LAYER_TARGETS is returned if any
	   framebuffer attachment is layered, and any populated attachment is
	   not layered, or if all populated color attachments are not from
	   textures of the same target.

       Additionally, if an error occurs, zero is returned.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if target is not GL_DRAW_FRAMEBUFFER,
       GL_READ_FRAMEBUFFER or GL_FRAMEBUFFER.
