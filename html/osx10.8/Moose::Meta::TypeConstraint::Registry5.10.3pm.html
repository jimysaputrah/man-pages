NAME
       Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint::Registry - registry for type constraints

DESCRIPTION
       This class is a registry that maps type constraint names to
       Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint objects.

       Currently, it is only used internally by Moose::Util::TypeConstraints,
       which creates a single global registry.

INHERITANCE
       "Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint::Registry" is a subclass of
       Class::MOP::Object.

METHODS
       Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint::Registry-&gtnew(%options)
	   This creates a new registry object based on the provided %options:

	   o	   parent_registry

		   This is an optional Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint::Registry
		   object.

	   o	   type_constraints

		   This is hash reference of type names to type objects. This
		   is optional. Constraints can be added to the registry after
		   it is created.

       $registry-&gtget_parent_registry
	   Returns the registry's parent registry, if it has one.

       $registry-&gthas_parent_registry
	   Returns true if the registry has a parent.

       $registry-&gtset_parent_registry($registry)
	   Sets the parent registry.

       $registry-&gtget_type_constraint($type_name)
	   This returns the Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint object from the
	   registry for the given name, if one exists.

       $registry-&gthas_type_constraint($type_name)
	   Returns true if the registry has a type of the given name.

       $registry-&gtadd_type_constraint($type)
	   Adds a new Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint object to the registry.

       $registry-&gtfind_type_constraint($type_name)
	   This method looks in the current registry for the named type. If
	   the type is not found, then this method will look in the registry's
	   parent, if it has one.
