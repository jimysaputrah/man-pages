REASSIGN OWNED(7)	PostgreSQL 9.1.4 Documentation	     REASSIGN OWNED(7)



NAME
       REASSIGN_OWNED - change the ownership of database objects owned by a
       database role

SYNOPSIS
       REASSIGN OWNED BY old_role [, ...] TO new_role

DESCRIPTION
       REASSIGN OWNED instructs the system to change the ownership of the
       database objects owned by one of the old_roles, to new_role.

PARAMETERS
       old_role
	   The name of a role. The ownership of all the objects in the current
	   database owned by this role will be reassigned to new_role.

       new_role
	   The name of the role that will be made the new owner of the
	   affected objects.

NOTES
       REASSIGN OWNED is often used to prepare for the removal of one or more
       roles. Because REASSIGN OWNED only affects the objects in the current
       database, it is usually necessary to execute this command in each
       database that contains objects owned by a role that is to be removed.


       REASSIGN OWNED requires privileges on both the source role(s) and the
       target role.

       The DROP OWNED (DROP_OWNED(7)) command is an alternative that drops all
       the database objects owned by one or more roles. Note also that DROP
       OWNED requires privileges only on the source role(s).

       The REASSIGN OWNED command does not affect the privileges granted to
       the old_roles in objects that are not owned by them. Use DROP OWNED to
       revoke those privileges.

       The REASSIGN OWNED command does not affect the ownership of any
       databases owned by the role. Use ALTER DATABASE (ALTER_DATABASE(7)) to
       reassign that ownership.

COMPATIBILITY
       The REASSIGN OWNED statement is a PostgreSQL extension.
