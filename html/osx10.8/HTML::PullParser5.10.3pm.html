NAME
       HTML::PullParser - Alternative HTML::Parser interface

SYNOPSIS
	use HTML::PullParser;

	$p = HTML::PullParser-&gtnew(file =&gt "index.html",
				   start =&gt 'event, tagname, @attr',
				   end	 =&gt 'event, tagname',
				   ignore_elements =&gt [qw(script style)],
				  ) || die "Can't open: $!";
	while (my $token = $p-&gtget_token) {
	    #...do something with $token
	}

DESCRIPTION
       The HTML::PullParser is an alternative interface to the HTML::Parser
       class.  It basically turns the HTML::Parser inside out.	You associate
       a file (or any IO::Handle object or string) with the parser at
       construction time and then repeatedly call $parser-&gtget_token to obtain
       the tags and text found in the parsed document.

       The following methods are provided:

       $p = HTML::PullParser-&gtnew( file =&gt $file, %options )
       $p = HTML::PullParser-&gtnew( doc =&gt \$doc, %options )
	   A "HTML::PullParser" can be made to parse from either a file or a
	   literal document based on whether the "file" or "doc" option is
	   passed to the parser's constructor.

	   The "file" passed in can either be a file name or a file handle
	   object.  If a file name is passed, and it can't be opened for
	   reading, then the constructor will return an undefined value and $!
	   will tell you why it failed.  Otherwise the argument is taken to be
	   some object that the "HTML::PullParser" can read() from when it
	   needs more data.  The stream will be read() until EOF, but not
	   closed.

	   A "doc" can be passed plain or as a reference to a scalar.  If a
	   reference is passed then the value of this scalar should not be
	   changed before all tokens have been extracted.

	   Next the information to be returned for the different token types
	   must be set up.  This is done by simply associating an argspec (as
	   defined in HTML::Parser) with the events you have an interest in.
	   For instance, if you want "start" tokens to be reported as the
	   string 'S' followed by the tagname and the attributes you might
	   pass an "start"-option like this:

	      $p = HTML::PullParser-&gtnew(
		     doc   =&gt $document_to_parse,
		     start =&gt '"S", tagname, @attr',
		     end   =&gt '"E", tagname',
		   );

	   At last other "HTML::Parser" options, like "ignore_tags", and
	   "unbroken_text", can be passed in.  Note that you should not use
	   the event_h options to set up parser handlers.  That would confuse
	   the inner logic of "HTML::PullParser".

       $token = $p-&gtget_token
	   This method will return the next token found in the HTML document,
	   or "undef" at the end of the document.  The token is returned as an
	   array reference.  The content of this array match the argspec set
	   up during "HTML::PullParser" construction.

       $p-&gtunget_token( @tokens )
	   If you find out you have read too many tokens you can push them
	   back, so that they are returned again the next time $p-&gtget_token
	   is called.

EXAMPLES
       The 'eg/hform' script shows how we might parse the form section of
       HTML::Documents using HTML::PullParser.
