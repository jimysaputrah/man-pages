NAME
       Regexp::Common::profanity -- provide regexes for profanity

SYNOPSIS
	   use Regexp::Common qw /profanity/;

	   while (<>) {
	       /$RE{profanity}/ 	      and  print "Contains profanity\n";
	   }

DESCRIPTION
       Please consult the manual of Regexp::Common for a general description
       of the works of this interface.

       Do not use this module directly, but load it via Regexp::Common.

   $RE{profanity}
       Returns a pattern matching words -- such as Carlin's "big seven" --
       that are most likely to give offense. Note that correct anatomical
       terms are deliberately not included in the list.

       Under "-keep" (see Regexp::Common):

       $1  captures the entire word

   $RE{profanity}{contextual}
       Returns a pattern matching words that are likely to give offense when
       used in specific contexts, but which also have genuinely non-offensive
       meanings.

       Under "-keep" (see Regexp::Common):

       $1  captures the entire word
