NAME
       Locale::Script - ISO codes for script identification (ISO 15924)

SYNOPSIS
	   use Locale::Script;
	   use Locale::Constants;

	   $script  = code2script('ph');		       # 'Phoenician'
	   $code    = script2code('Tibetan');		       # 'bo'
	   $code3   = script2code('Tibetan',
				  LOCALE_CODE_ALPHA_3);        # 'bod'
	   $codeN   = script2code('Tibetan',
				  LOCALE_CODE_ALPHA_NUMERIC);  # 330

	   @codes   = all_script_codes();
	   @scripts = all_script_names();

DESCRIPTION
       The "Locale::Script" module provides access to the ISO codes for
       identifying scripts, as defined in ISO 15924.  For example, Egyptian
       hieroglyphs are denoted by the two-letter code 'eg', the three-letter
       code 'egy', and the numeric code 050.

       You can either access the codes via the conversion routines (described
       below), or with the two functions which return lists of all script
       codes or all script names.

       There are three different code sets you can use for identifying
       scripts:

       alpha-2
	   Two letter codes, such as 'bo' for Tibetan.	This code set is
	   identified with the symbol "LOCALE_CODE_ALPHA_2".

       alpha-3
	   Three letter codes, such as 'ell' for Greek.  This code set is
	   identified with the symbol "LOCALE_CODE_ALPHA_3".

       numeric
	   Numeric codes, such as 410 for Hiragana.  This code set is
	   identified with the symbol "LOCALE_CODE_NUMERIC".

       All of the routines take an optional additional argument which
       specifies the code set to use.  If not specified, it defaults to the
       two-letter codes.  This is partly for backwards compatibility (previous
       versions of Locale modules only supported the alpha-2 codes), and
       partly because they are the most widely used codes.

       The alpha-2 and alpha-3 codes are not case-dependent, so you can use
       'BO', 'Bo', 'bO' or 'bo' for Tibetan.  When a code is returned by one
       of the functions in this module, it will always be lower-case.

   SPECIAL CODES
       The standard defines various special codes.

       o   The standard reserves codes in the ranges qa - qt, qaa - qat, and
	   900 - 919, for private use.

       o   zx, zxx, and 997, are the codes for unwritten languages.

       o   zy, zyy, and 998, are the codes for an undetermined script.

       o   zz, zzz, and 999, are the codes for an uncoded script.

       The private codes are not recognised by Locale::Script, but the others
       are.

CONVERSION ROUTINES
       There are three conversion routines: "code2script()", "script2code()",
       and "script_code2code()".

       code2script( CODE, [ CODESET ] )
	   This function takes a script code and returns a string which
	   contains the name of the script identified.	If the code is not a
	   valid script code, as defined by ISO 15924, then "undef" will be
	   returned:

	       $script = code2script('cy');   # Cyrillic

       script2code( STRING, [ CODESET ] )
	   This function takes a script name and returns the corresponding
	   script code, if such exists.  If the argument could not be
	   identified as a script name, then "undef" will be returned:

	       $code = script2code('Gothic', LOCALE_CODE_ALPHA_3);
	       # $code will now be 'gth'

	   The case of the script name is not important.  See the section
	   "KNOWN BUGS AND LIMITATIONS" below.

       script_code2code( CODE, CODESET, CODESET )
	   This function takes a script code from one code set, and returns
	   the corresponding code from another code set.

	       $alpha2 = script_code2code('jwi',
			    LOCALE_CODE_ALPHA_3 => LOCALE_CODE_ALPHA_2);
	       # $alpha2 will now be 'jw' (Javanese)

	   If the code passed is not a valid script code in the first code
	   set, or if there isn't a code for the corresponding script in the
	   second code set, then "undef" will be returned.

QUERY ROUTINES
       There are two function which can be used to obtain a list of all codes,
       or all script names:

       "all_script_codes ( [ CODESET ] )"
	   Returns a list of all two-letter script codes.  The codes are
	   guaranteed to be all lower-case, and not in any particular order.

       "all_script_names ( [ CODESET ] )"
	   Returns a list of all script names for which there is a
	   corresponding script code in the specified code set.  The names are
	   capitalised, and not returned in any particular order.

EXAMPLES
       The following example illustrates use of the "code2script()" function.
       The user is prompted for a script code, and then told the corresponding
       script name:

	   $| = 1;   # turn off buffering

	   print "Enter script code: ";
	   chop($code = <STDIN>);
	   $script = code2script($code, LOCALE_CODE_ALPHA_2);
	   if (defined $script)
	   {
	       print "$code = $script\n";
	   }
	   else
	   {
	       print "'$code' is not a valid script code!\n";
	   }

KNOWN BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
       o   When using "script2code()", the script name must currently appear
	   exactly as it does in the source of the module. For example,

	       script2code('Egyptian hieroglyphs')

	   will return eg, as expected. But the following will all return
	   "undef":

	       script2code('hieroglyphs')
	       script2code('Egyptian Hieroglypics')

	   If there's need for it, a future version could have variants for
	   script names.

       o   In the current implementation, all data is read in when the module
	   is loaded, and then held in memory.	A lazy implementation would be
	   more memory friendly.
