NAME
       DO - execute an anonymous code block

SYNOPSIS
       DO [ LANGUAGE lang_name ] code

DESCRIPTION
       DO executes an anonymous code block, or in other words a transient
       anonymous function in a procedural language.

       The code block is treated as though it were the body of a function with
       no parameters, returning void. It is parsed and executed a single time.

       The optional LANGUAGE clause can be written either before or after the
       code block.

PARAMETERS
       code
	   The procedural language code to be executed. This must be specified
	   as a string literal, just as in CREATE FUNCTION. Use of a
	   dollar-quoted literal is recommended.

       lang_name
	   The name of the procedural language the code is written in. If
	   omitted, the default is plpgsql.

NOTES
       The procedural language to be used must already have been installed
       into the current database by means of CREATE LANGUAGE.  plpgsql is
       installed by default, but other languages are not.

       The user must have USAGE privilege for the procedural language, or must
       be a superuser if the language is untrusted. This is the same privilege
       requirement as for creating a function in the language.

EXAMPLES
       Grant all privileges on all views in schema public to role webuser:

	   DO $$DECLARE r record;
	   BEGIN
	       FOR r IN SELECT table_schema, table_name FROM information_schema.tables
			WHERE table_type = 'VIEW' AND table_schema = 'public'
	       LOOP
		   EXECUTE 'GRANT ALL ON ' || quote_ident(r.table_schema) || '.' || quote_ident(r.table_name) || ' TO webuser';
	       END LOOP;
	   END$$;

COMPATIBILITY
       There is no DO statement in the SQL standard.
