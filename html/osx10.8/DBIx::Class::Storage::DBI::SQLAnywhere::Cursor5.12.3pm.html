NAME
       DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::SQLAnywhere::Cursor - GUID Support for SQL
       Anywhere over DBD::SQLAnywhere

DESCRIPTION
       This class is for normalizing GUIDs retrieved from SQL Anywhere via
       DBD::SQLAnywhere.

       You probably don't want to be here, see
       DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::SQLAnywhere for information on the SQL
       Anywhere driver.

       Unfortunately when using DBD::SQLAnywhere, GUIDs come back in binary,
       the purpose of this class is to transform them to text.
       DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::SQLAnywhere sets cursor_class to this class
       by default.  It is overridable via your connect_info.

       You can use DBIx::Class::Cursor::Cached safely with this class and not
       lose the GUID normalizing functionality, ::Cursor::Cached uses the
       underlying class data for the inner cursor class.
