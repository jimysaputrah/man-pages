NAME
       subs - Perl pragma to predeclare sub names

SYNOPSIS
	   use subs qw(frob);
	   frob 3..10;

DESCRIPTION
       This will predeclare all the subroutine whose names are in the list,
       allowing you to use them without parentheses even before they're
       declared.

       Unlike pragmas that affect the $^H hints variable, the "use vars" and
       "use subs" declarations are not BLOCK-scoped.  They are thus effective
       for the entire file in which they appear.  You may not rescind such
       declarations with "no vars" or "no subs".

       See "Pragmatic Modules" in perlmodlib and "strict subs" in strict.
