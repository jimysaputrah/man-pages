STATVFS(3)		 BSD Library Functions Manual		    STATVFS(3)

NAME
     fstatvfs, statvfs -- retrieve file system information

LIBRARY
     Standard C Library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/statvfs.h>

     int
     fstatvfs(int fildes, struct statvfs *buf);

     int
     statvfs(const char *restrict path, struct statvfs *restrict buf);

DESCRIPTION
     The statvfs() and fstatvfs() functions attempt to fill the structure
     pointed to by buf with file system statistics, but portable applications
     must not depend on this.  Applications must pass a pathname or file
     descriptor which refers to a file on the file system in which they are
     interested.

     The statvfs structure contains the following members:

	   f_namemax  The maximum length in bytes of a file name on this file
		      system.  Applications should use pathconf(2) instead.

	   f_fsid     Not meaningful in this implementation.

	   f_frsize   The size in bytes of the minimum unit of allocation on
		      this file system.  (This corresponds to the f_bsize mem-
		      ber of struct statfs.)

	   f_bsize    The preferred length of I/O requests for files on this
		      file system.  (Corresponds to the f_iosize member of
		      struct statfs.)

	   f_flag     Flags describing mount options for this file system; see
		      below.

     In addition, there are three members of type fsfilcnt_t, which represent
     counts of file serial numbers (i.e., inodes); these are named f_files,
     f_favail, and f_ffree, and represent the number of file serial numbers
     which exist in total, are available to unprivileged processes, and are
     available to privileged processes, respectively.  Likewise, the members
     f_blocks, f_bavail, and f_bfree (all of type fsblkcnt_t) represent the
     respective allocation-block counts.

     There are two flags defined for the f_flag member:

	   ST_RDONLY  The file system is mounted read-only.

	   ST_NOSUID  The semantics of the S_ISUID and S_ISGID file mode bits
		      are not supported by, or are disabled on, this file sys-
		      tem.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
     The statvfs() and fstatvfs() functions are implemented as wrappers around
     the statfs() and fstatfs() functions, respectively.  Not all the informa-
     tion provided by those functions is made available through this inter-
     face.

RETURN VALUES
     The statvfs() and fstatvfs() functions return the value 0 if successful;
     otherwise the value -1 is returned and the global variable errno is set
     to indicate the error.

ERRORS
     The statvfs() function fails if one or more of the following are true:

     [EACCES]		Search permission is denied for a component of the
			path prefix of path.

     [EFAULT]		Buf or path points to an invalid address.

     [EIO]		An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to
			the file system.

     [ELOOP]		Too many symbolic links were encountered in translat-
			ing path.

     [ENAMETOOLONG]	The length of a component of path exceeds {NAME_MAX}
			characters, or the length of path exceeds {PATH_MAX}
			characters.

     [ENOENT]		The file referred to by path does not exist.

     [ENOTDIR]		A component of the path prefix of Path is not a direc-
			tory.

     The fstatvfs() functions fails if one or more of the following are true:

     [EBADF]		fildes is not a valid open file descriptor.

     [EFAULT]		Buf points to an invalid address.

     [EIO]		An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to
			the file system.

STANDARDS
     The statvfs() and fstatvfs() functions conform to IEEE Std 1003.1-2001
     (``POSIX.1'').  As standardized, portable applications cannot depend on
     these functions returning any valid information at all.  This implementa-
     tion attempts to provide as much useful information as is provided by the
     underlying file system, subject to the limitations of the specified data
     types.
