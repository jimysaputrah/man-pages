NAME
       Digest::base - Digest base class

SYNOPSIS
	 package Digest::Foo;
	 use base 'Digest::base';

DESCRIPTION
       The "Digest::base" class provide implementations of the methods
       "addfile" and "add_bits" in terms of "add", and of the methods
       "hexdigest" and "b64digest" in terms of "digest".

       Digest implementations might want to inherit from this class to get
       this implementations of the alternative add and digest methods.	A
       minimal subclass needs to implement the following methods by itself:

	   new
	   clone
	   add
	   digest

       The arguments and expected behaviour of these methods are described in
       Digest.
