NAME
       SQL::Abstract::Test - Helper function for testing SQL::Abstract

SYNOPSIS
	 use SQL::Abstract;
	 use Test::More;
	 use SQL::Abstract::Test import => [qw/
	   is_same_sql_bind is_same_sql is_same_bind
	   eq_sql_bind eq_sql eq_bind
	 /];

	 my ($sql, @bind) = SQL::Abstract->new->select(%args);

	 is_same_sql_bind($given_sql,	 \@given_bind,
			  $expected_sql, \@expected_bind, $test_msg);

	 is_same_sql($given_sql, $expected_sql, $test_msg);
	 is_same_bind(\@given_bind, \@expected_bind, $test_msg);

	 my $is_same = eq_sql_bind($given_sql,	  \@given_bind,
				   $expected_sql, \@expected_bind);

	 my $sql_same = eq_sql($given_sql, $expected_sql);
	 my $bind_same = eq_bind(\@given_bind, \@expected_bind);

DESCRIPTION
       This module is only intended for authors of tests on SQL::Abstract and
       related modules; it exports functions for comparing two SQL statements
       and their bound values.

       The SQL comparison is performed on abstract syntax, ignoring
       differences in spaces or in levels of parentheses.  Therefore the tests
       will pass as long as the semantics is preserved, even if the surface
       syntax has changed.

       Disclaimer : the semantic equivalence handling is pretty limited.  A
       lot of effort goes into distinguishing significant from non-significant
       parenthesis, including AND/OR operator associativity.  Currently this
       module does not support commutativity and more intelligent
       transformations like Morgan laws, etc.

       For a good overview of what this test framework is capable of refer to
       "t/10test.t"

FUNCTIONS
   is_same_sql_bind
	 is_same_sql_bind($given_sql,	 \@given_bind,
			  $expected_sql, \@expected_bind, $test_msg);

       Compares given and expected pairs of "($sql, \@bind)", and calls "ok"
       in Test::Builder on the result, with $test_msg as message. If the test
       fails, a detailed diagnostic is printed. For clients which use
       Test::More, this is the one of the three functions ("is_same_sql_bind",
       "is_same_sql", "is_same_bind") that needs to be imported.

   is_same_sql
	 is_same_sql($given_sql, $expected_sql, $test_msg);

       Compares given and expected SQL statements, and calls "ok" in
       Test::Builder on the result, with $test_msg as message. If the test
       fails, a detailed diagnostic is printed. For clients which use
       Test::More, this is the one of the three functions ("is_same_sql_bind",
       "is_same_sql", "is_same_bind") that needs to be imported.

   is_same_bind
	 is_same_bind(\@given_bind, \@expected_bind, $test_msg);

       Compares given and expected bind values, and calls "ok" in
       Test::Builder on the result, with $test_msg as message. If the test
       fails, a detailed diagnostic is printed. For clients which use
       Test::More, this is the one of the three functions ("is_same_sql_bind",
       "is_same_sql", "is_same_bind") that needs to be imported.

   eq_sql_bind
	 my $is_same = eq_sql_bind($given_sql,	  \@given_bind,
				   $expected_sql, \@expected_bind);

       Compares given and expected pairs of "($sql, \@bind)". Similar to
       "is_same_sql_bind", but it just returns a boolean value and does not
       print diagnostics or talk to Test::Builder.

   eq_sql
	 my $is_same = eq_sql($given_sql, $expected_sql);

       Compares the abstract syntax of two SQL statements. Similar to
       "is_same_sql", but it just returns a boolean value and does not print
       diagnostics or talk to Test::Builder. If the result is false, the
       global variable "$sql_differ" will contain the SQL portion where a
       difference was encountered; this is useful for printing diagnostics.

   eq_bind
	 my $is_same = eq_sql(\@given_bind, \@expected_bind);

       Compares two lists of bind values, taking into account the fact that
       some of the values may be arrayrefs (see "bindtype" in SQL::Abstract).
       Similar to "is_same_bind", but it just returns a boolean value and does
       not print diagnostics or talk to Test::Builder.

GLOBAL VARIABLES
   $case_sensitive
       If true, SQL comparisons will be case-sensitive. Default is false;

   $parenthesis_significant
       If true, SQL comparison will preserve and report difference in nested
       parenthesis. Useful while testing "IN (( x ))" vs "IN ( x )".  Defaults
       to false;

   $sql_differ
       When "eq_sql" returns false, the global variable $sql_differ contains
       the SQL portion where a difference was encountered.
