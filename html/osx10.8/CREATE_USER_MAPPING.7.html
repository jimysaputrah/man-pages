NAME
       CREATE_USER_MAPPING - define a new mapping of a user to a foreign
       server

SYNOPSIS
       CREATE USER MAPPING FOR { user_name | USER | CURRENT_USER | PUBLIC }
	   SERVER server_name
	   [ OPTIONS ( option 'value' [ , ... ] ) ]

DESCRIPTION
       CREATE USER MAPPING defines a mapping of a user to a foreign server. A
       user mapping typically encapsulates connection information that a
       foreign-data wrapper uses together with the information encapsulated by
       a foreign server to access an external data resource.

       The owner of a foreign server can create user mappings for that server
       for any user. Also, a user can create a user mapping for his own user
       name if USAGE privilege on the server has been granted to the user.

PARAMETERS
       user_name
	   The name of an existing user that is mapped to foreign server.
	   CURRENT_USER and USER match the name of the current user. When
	   PUBLIC is specified, a so-called public mapping is created that is
	   used when no user-specific mapping is applicable.

       server_name
	   The name of an existing server for which the user mapping is to be
	   created.

       OPTIONS ( option 'value' [, ... ] )
	   This clause specifies the options of the user mapping. The options
	   typically define the actual user name and password of the mapping.
	   Option names must be unique. The allowed option names and values
	   are specific to the server's foreign-data wrapper.

EXAMPLES
       Create a user mapping for user bob, server foo:

	   CREATE USER MAPPING FOR bob SERVER foo OPTIONS (user 'bob', password 'secret');

COMPATIBILITY
       CREATE USER MAPPING conforms to ISO/IEC 9075-9 (SQL/MED).
