NAME
       snmp - cups snmp backend

SYNOPSIS
       /usr/libexec/cups/backend/snmp ip-address-or-hostname
       lpinfo -v --include-schemes snmp

DESCRIPTION
       The  CUPS  SNMP backend provides legacy discovery and identification of
       network printers using SNMPv1. When  used  for  discovery  through  the
       scheduler,  the backend will list all printers that respond to a broad-
       cast SNMPv1 query with the "public" community name. Additional  queries
       are  then  sent to printers that respond in order to determine the cor-
       rect device URI, make and  model,  and  other  information  needed  for
       printing.

       In the first form, the SNMP backend is run directly by the user to look
       up the device URI and other information when you have an IP address  or
       hostname.  This	can  be used for programs that need to configure print
       queues where the user has supplied an address but nothing else.

       In the second form, the	SNMP  backend  is  run	indirectly  using  the
       lpinfo(8)  command.  The output provides all printers detected via SNMP
       on the configured broadcast addresses. Note: no broadcast addresses are
       configured by default.

MIBS
       The  CUPS SNMP backend uses the information from the Host, Printer, and
       Port Monitor MIBs along with some vendor private MIBs  and  intelligent
       port  probes to determine the correct device URI and make and model for
       each printer.

CONFIGURATION
       The SNMP backend reads  the  /private/etc/cups/snmp.conf  configuration
       file, if present, to set the default broadcast address, community name,
       and logging level.  The	configuration  file  is  documented  in  cups-
       snmp.conf(5).   The  DebugLevel	value  can  be	overridden  using  the
       CUPS_DEBUG_LEVEL environment variable and the MaxRunTime value  can  be
       overridden using the CUPS_MAX_RUN_TIME environment variable.
