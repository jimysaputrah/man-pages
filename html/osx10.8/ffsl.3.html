NAME
     ffs, ffsl, fls, flsl -- find first or last bit set in a bit string

LIBRARY
     Standard C Library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <strings.h>

     int
     ffs(int i);

     int
     ffsl(long i);

     int
     fls(int i);

     int
     flsl(long i);

DESCRIPTION
     The ffs() and ffsl() functions find the first bit set (beginning with the
     least significant bit) in i and return the index of that bit.

     The fls() and flsl() functions find the last bit set in i and return the
     index of that bit.

     Bits are numbered starting at 1 (the least significant bit).  A return
     value of zero from any of these functions means that the argument was
     zero.

SEE ALSO
     bitstring(3)

HISTORY
     The ffs() function appeared in 4.3BSD.  Its prototype existed previously
     in <string.h> before it was moved to <strings.h> for IEEE Std 1003.1-2001
     (``POSIX.1'') compliance.

     The ffsl(), fls(), and flsl() functions appeared in FreeBSD 5.3.
