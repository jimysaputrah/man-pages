NAME
       glDepthRange  -	specify mapping of depth values from normalized device
       coordinates to window coordinates


C SPECIFICATION
       void glDepthRange( GLclampd zNear,
			  GLclampd zFar )


PARAMETERS
       zNear  Specifies the mapping of the near clipping plane to window coor-
	      dinates.	The initial value is 0.

       zFar   Specifies  the mapping of the far clipping plane to window coor-
	      dinates.	The initial value is 1.

DESCRIPTION
       After clipping and division by w, depth coordinates range from -1 to 1,
       corresponding to the near and far clipping planes.  glDepthRange speci-
       fies a linear mapping of the normalized depth coordinates in this range
       to  window  depth  coordinates.	 Regardless of the actual depth buffer
       implementation, window coordinate depth values are  treated  as	though
       they  range from 0 through 1 (like color components).  Thus, the values
       accepted by glDepthRange are both clamped to this range before they are
       accepted.

       The  setting  of (0,1) maps the near plane to 0 and the far plane to 1.
       With this mapping, the depth buffer range is fully utilized.

NOTES
       It is not necessary that zNear be less  than  zFar.   Reverse  mappings
       such as zNear=1, and zFar=0 are acceptable.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_OPERATION  is  generated if glDepthRange is executed between
       the execution of glBegin and the corresponding execution of glEnd.
