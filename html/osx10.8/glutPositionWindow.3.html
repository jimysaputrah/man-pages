NAME
       glutPositionWindow  -  requests a change to the position of the current
       window.

SYNTAX
       #include &ltGLUT/glut.h&gt

       void glutPositionWindow(int x, int y);

ARGUMENTS
       x	 New X location of window in pixels.

       y	 New Y location of window in pixels.

DESCRIPTION
       glutPositionWindow requests a change in the  position  of  the  current
       window. For top-level windows, the x and y parameters are pixel offsets
       from the screen origin. For subwindows, the  x  and  y  parameters  are
       pixel offsets from the window's parent window origin.

       The  requests by glutPositionWindow are not processed immediately.  The
       request is executed after returning to the main event loop. This allows
       multiple   glutPositionWindow,  glutReshapeWindow,  and	glutFullScreen
       requests to the same window to be coalesced.

       In the case of top-level windows, a glutPositionWindow call is  consid-
       ered  only  a  request for positioning the window. The window system is
       free to apply its own policies  to  top-level  window  placement.   The
       intent is that top-level windows should be repositioned according glut-
       PositionWindow's parameters.

       glutPositionWindow disables the full screen status of a window if  pre-
       viously enabled.
