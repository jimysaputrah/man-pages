NAME
       Digest::HMAC - Keyed-Hashing for Message Authentication

SYNOPSIS
	# Functional style
	use Digest::HMAC qw(hmac hmac_hex);
	$digest = hmac($data, $key, \&myhash);
	print hmac_hex($data, $key, \&myhash);

	# OO style
	use Digest::HMAC;
	$hmac = Digest::HMAC-&gtnew($key, "Digest::MyHash");

	$hmac-&gtadd($data);
	$hmac-&gtaddfile(*FILE);

	$digest = $hmac-&gtdigest;
	$digest = $hmac-&gthexdigest;
	$digest = $hmac-&gtb64digest;

DESCRIPTION
       HMAC is used for message integrity checks between two parties that
       share a secret key, and works in combination with some other Digest
       algorithm, usually MD5 or SHA-1.  The HMAC mechanism is described in
       RFC 2104.

       HMAC follow the common "Digest::" interface, but the constructor takes
       the secret key and the name of some other simple "Digest::" as
       argument.

       The hmac() and hmac_hex() functions and the Digest::HMAC-&gtnew()
       constructor takes an optional $blocksize argument as well.  The HMAC
       algorithm assumes the digester to hash by iterating a basic compression
       function on blocks of data and the $blocksize should match the byte-
       length of such blocks.

       The default $blocksize is 64 which is suitable for the MD5 and SHA-1
       digest functions.  For stronger algorithms the blocksize probably needs
       to be increased.
