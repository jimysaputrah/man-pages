NAME
       Moose::Manual::MooseX - Recommended Moose extensions

MooseX?
       It's easy to extend and change Moose, and this is part of what makes
       Moose so powerful. You can use the MOP API to do things your own way,
       add new features, and generally customize your Moose.

       Writing your own extensions does require a good understanding of the
       meta-model. You can start learning about this with the
       Moose::Manual::MOP docs. There are also several extension recipes in
       the Moose::Cookbook.

       Explaining how to write extensions is beyond the scope of this manual.
       Fortunately, lots of people have already written extensions and put
       them on CPAN for you.

       This document covers a few of the ones we like best.

MooseX::AttributeHelpers
       The functionality of this MooseX module has been moved into Moose core.
       See Moose::Meta::Attribute::Native.

Moose::Autobox
       MooseX::AttributeHelpers, but turned inside out, Moose::Autobox
       provides methods on both arrays/hashes/etc. but also references to
       them, using Moose roles, allowing you do to things like:

	 use Moose::Autobox;

	 $somebody_elses_object-&gtorders-&gtpush($order);

       Lexically scoped and not to everybody's taste, but very handy for
       sugaring up other people's APIs and your own code.

MooseX::StrictConstructor
       By default, Moose lets you pass any old junk into a class's
       constructor. If you load MooseX::StrictConstructor, your class will
       throw an error if it sees something it doesn't recognize;

	 package User;

	 use Moose;
	 use MooseX::StrictConstructor;

	 has 'name';
	 has 'email';

	 User-&gtnew( name =&gt 'Bob', emali =&gt 'bob@example.com' );

       With MooseX::StrictConstructor, that typo ("emali") will cause a
       runtime error. With plain old Moose, the "emali" attribute would be
       silently ignored.

MooseX::Params::Validate
       We have high hopes for the future of MooseX::Method::Signatures and
       MooseX::Declare. However, these modules, while used regularly in
       production by some of the more insane members of the community, are
       still marked alpha just in case backwards incompatible changes need to
       be made.

       If you don't want to risk that, for now we recommend the decidedly more
       clunky (but also faster and simpler) MooseX::Params::Validate. This
       module lets you apply Moose types and coercions to any method
       arguments.

	 package User;

	 use Moose;
	 use MooseX::Params::Validate;

	 sub login {
	     my $self = shift;
	     my ($password)
		 = validated_list( \@_, password =&gt { isa =&gt 'Str', required =&gt 1 } );

	     ...
	 }

MooseX::Getopt
       This is a role which adds a "new_with_options" method to your class.
       This is a constructor that takes the command line options and uses them
       to populate attributes.

       This makes writing a command-line application as a module trivially
       simple:

	 package App::Foo;

	 use Moose;
	 with 'MooseX::Getopt';

	 has 'input' =&gt (
	     is       =&gt 'ro',
	     isa      =&gt 'Str',
	     required =&gt 1
	 );

	 has 'output' =&gt (
	     is       =&gt 'ro',
	     isa      =&gt 'Str',
	     required =&gt 1
	 );

	 sub run { ... }

       Then in the script that gets run we have:

	 use App::Foo;

	 App::Foo-&gtnew_with_options-&gtrun;

       From the command line, someone can execute the script:

	 foo@example&gt foo --input /path/to/input --output /path/to/output

MooseX::Singleton
       To be honest, using a singleton is just a way to have a magic global
       variable in languages that don't actually have global variables.

       In perl, you can just as easily use a global. However, if your
       colleagues are Java-infected, they might prefer a singleton. Also, if
       you have an existing class that isn't a singleton but should be, using
       MooseX::Singleton is the easiest way to convert it.

	 package Config;

	 use MooseX::Singleton; # instead of Moose

	 has 'cache_dir' =&gt ( ... );

       It's that simple.

EXTENSIONS TO CONSIDER
       There are literally dozens of other extensions on CPAN. This is a list
       of extensions that you might find useful, but we're not quite ready to
       endorse just yet.

   MooseX::Declare
       Extends Perl with Moose-based keywords using "Devel::Declare". Very
       cool, but still new and experimental.

	 class User {

	     has 'name'  =&gt ( ... );
	     has 'email' =&gt ( ... );

	     method login (Str $password) { ... }
	 }

   MooseX::Types
       This extension helps you build a type library for your application. It
       also lets you predeclare type names and use them as barewords.

	 use MooseX::Types -declare =&gt ['PositiveInt'];
	 use MooseX::Types::Moose 'Int';

	 subtype PositiveInt,
	     as Int,
	     where { $_ &gt 0 },
	     message { "Int is not larger than 0" };

       One nice feature is that those bareword names are actually namespaced
       in Moose's type registry, so multiple applications can use the same
       bareword names, even if the type definitions differ.

   MooseX::Types::Structured
       This extension builds on top of MooseX::Types to let you declare
       complex data structure types.

	 use MooseX::Types -declare =&gt [ qw( Name Color ) ];
	 use MooseX::Types::Moose qw(Str Int);
	 use MooseX::Types::Structured qw(Dict Tuple Optional);

	 subtype Name
	     =&gt as Dict[ first =&gt Str, middle =&gt Optional[Str], last =&gt Str ];

	 subtype Color
	     =&gt as Tuple[ Int, Int, Int, Optional[Int] ];

       Of course, you could always use objects to represent these sorts of
       things too.

   MooseX::ClassAttribute
       This extension provides class attributes for Moose classes. The
       declared class attributes are introspectable just like regular Moose
       attributes.

	 package User;

	 use Moose;
	 use MooseX::ClassAttribute;

	 has 'name' =&gt ( ... );

	 class_has 'Cache' =&gt ( ... );

       Note however that this class attribute does not inherit like a
       Class::Data::Inheritable or similar attribute - calling

	 $subclass-&gtCache($cache);

       will set it for the superclass as well. Additionally, class data is
       usually The Wrong Thing To Do in a strongly OO program since it makes
       testing a lot harder - consider carefully whether you'd be better off
       with an object that's passed around instead.

   MooseX::Daemonize
       This is a role that provides a number of methods useful for creating a
       daemon, including methods for starting and stopping, managing a PID
       file, and signal handling.

   MooseX::Role::Parameterized
       If you find yourself wanting a role that customizes itself for each
       consumer, this is the tool for you. With this module, you can create a
       role that accepts parameters and generates attributes, methods, etc. on
       a customized basis for each consumer.

   MooseX::POE
       This is a small wrapper that ties together a Moose class with
       "POE::Session", and gives you an "event" sugar function to declare
       event handlers.

   MooseX::FollowPBP
       Automatically names all accessors Perl Best Practices-style, "get_size"
       and "set_size".

   MooseX::SemiAffordanceAccessor
       Automatically names all accessors with an explicit set and implicit
       get, "size" and "set_size".

   MooseX::NonMoose
       MooseX::NonMoose allows for easily subclassing non-Moose classes with
       Moose, taking care of the annoying details connected with doing this,
       such as setting up proper inheritance from Moose::Object and installing
       (and inlining, at make_immutable time) a constructor that makes sure
       things like BUILD methods are called.
