NAME
       DROP_EXTENSION - remove an extension

SYNOPSIS
       DROP EXTENSION [ IF EXISTS ] extension_name [, ...] [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ]

DESCRIPTION
       DROP EXTENSION removes extensions from the database. Dropping an
       extension causes its component objects to be dropped as well.

       You must own the extension to use DROP EXTENSION.

PARAMETERS
       IF EXISTS
	   Do not throw an error if the extension does not exist. A notice is
	   issued in this case.

       extension_name
	   The name of an installed extension.

       CASCADE
	   Automatically drop objects that depend on the extension.

       RESTRICT
	   Refuse to drop the extension if any objects depend on it (other
	   than its own member objects and other extensions listed in the same
	   DROP command). This is the default.

EXAMPLES
       To remove the extension hstore from the current database:

	   DROP EXTENSION hstore;

       This command will fail if any of hstore's objects are in use in the
       database, for example if any tables have columns of the hstore type.
       Add the CASCADE option to forcibly remove those dependent objects as
       well.

COMPATIBILITY
       DROP EXTENSION is a PostgreSQL extension.
