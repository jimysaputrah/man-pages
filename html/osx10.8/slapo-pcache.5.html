SLAPO-PCACHE(5) 					       SLAPO-PCACHE(5)



NAME
       slapo-pcache - proxy cache overlay to slapd

SYNOPSIS
       /etc/openldap/slapd.conf

DESCRIPTION
       The  pcache  overlay to slapd(8) allows caching of LDAP search requests
       (queries) in a local database.  For an incoming query, the proxy  cache
       determines its corresponding template. If the template was specified as
       cacheable using the pcacheTemplate directive and the  request  is  con-
       tained  in a cached request, it is answered from the proxy cache.  Oth-
       erwise, the search is performed as usual and cacheable  search  results
       are saved in the cache for use in future queries.


       A template is defined by a filter string and an index identifying a set
       of attributes. The template string for  a  query  can  be  obtained  by
       removing  assertion  values  from  the  RFC  4515 representation of its
       search filter. A query belongs to a template if its template string and
       set  of projected attributes correspond to a cacheable template.  Exam-
       ples of template strings  are  (mail=),	(|(sn=)(cn=)),	(&(sn=)(given-
       Name=)).


       The  config  directives	that are specific to the pcache overlay can be
       prefixed by pcache-, to avoid conflicts with directives specific to the
       underlying database or to other stacked overlays.  This may be particu-
       larly useful for those directives that refer to the  backend  used  for
       local  storage.	The following cache specific directives can be used to
       configure the proxy cache:

       overlay pcache
	      This directive adds the proxy cache overlay to the current back-
	      end. The proxy cache overlay may be used with any backend but is
	      intended for use with the ldap, meta, and sql  backends.	Please
	      note  that the underlying backend must have a configured rootdn.

       pcache &ltdatabase&gt &ltmax_entries&gt &ltnumattrsets&gt &ltentry_limit&gt &ltcc_period&gt
	      The directive enables proxy caching in the current  backend  and
	      sets general cache parameters. A &ltdatabase&gt backend will be used
	      internally to maintain the cached entries. The  chosen  database
	      will  need  to  be  configured  as  well,  as shown below. Cache
	      replacement  is  invoked	when   the   cache   size   grows   to
	      &ltmax_entries&gt  entries  and  continues till the cache size drops
	      below this size.	&ltnumattrsets&gt should be equal to the number of
	      following  pcacheAttrset	directives. Queries are cached only if
	      they correspond to a cacheable template (specified by  the  pca-
	      cheTemplate  directive)  and  the  number of entries returned is
	      less than &ltentry_limit&gt. Consistency check  is  performed  every
	      &ltcc_period&gt  duration (specified in secs). In each cycle queries
	      with expired "time to live(TTL)" are  removed.  A  sample  cache
	      configuration is:

	      pcache bdb 10000 1 50 100


       pcacheAttrset &ltindex&gt &ltattrs...&gt
	      Used to associate a set of attributes &ltattrs..&gt with an &ltindex&gt.
	      Each attribute set is associated	with  an  integer  from  0  to
	      &ltnumattrsets&gt-1.	These  indices	are used by the pcacheTemplate
	      directive to define cacheable templates.	A  set	of  attributes
	      cannot  be  empty.   A set of attributes can contain the special
	      attributes "*"  (all  user  attributes),	"+"  (all  operational
	      attributes)  or both; in the latter case, any other attribute is
	      redundant  and  should  be  avoided  for	clarity.   A  set   of
	      attributes  can  contain	"1.1"  as  the only attribute; in this
	      case, only the presence of the entries  is  cached.   Attributes
	      prefixed by "undef:" need not be present in the schema.


       pcacheMaxQueries &ltqueries&gt
	      Specify  the  maximum number of queries to cache. The default is
	      10000.


       pcacheValidate { TRUE | FALSE }
	      Check whether the results of a query being cached  can  actually
	      be  returned from the cache by the proxy DSA.  When enabled, the
	      entries being returned while caching the results of a query  are
	      checked to ensure consistency with the schema known to the proxy
	      DSA.  In case of failure, the query is not cached.  By  default,
	      the check is off.


       pcacheOffline { TRUE | FALSE }
	      Set  the	cache  to offline mode. While offline, the consistency
	      checker will be stopped and  no  expirations  will  occur.  This
	      allows  the  cache  contents  to	be used indefinitely while the
	      proxy is cut off from network access to  the  remote  DSA.   The
	      default  is  FALSE, i.e. consistency checks and expirations will
	      be performed.


       pcachePersist { TRUE | FALSE }
	      Specify whether  the  cached  queries  should  be  saved	across
	      restarts	of  the  caching  proxy, to provide hot startup of the
	      cache.  Only non-expired queries are reloaded.  The  default  is
	      FALSE.

	      CAVEAT: of course, the configuration of the proxy cache must not
	      change across restarts; the pcache overlay does not perform  any
	      consistency checks in this sense.  In detail, this option should
	      be disabled unless the existing pcacheAttrset and pcacheTemplate
	      directives are not changed neither in order nor in contents.  If
	      new sets and templates are added, or if  other  details  of  the
	      pcache overlay configuration changed, this feature should not be
	      affected.


       pcacheTemplate  &lttemplate_string&gt   &ltattrset_index&gt   &ltttl&gt   [&ltnegttl&gt
       [&ltlimitttl&gt [&ltttr&gt]]]
	      Specifies a cacheable template  and  "time  to  live"  &ltttl&gt  of
	      queries  belonging  to the template. An optional &ltnegttl&gt can be
	      used to  specify	that  negative	results  (i.e.,  queries  that
	      returned	zero  entries) should also be cached for the specified
	      amount of time. Negative	results  are  not  cached  by  default
	      (&ltnegttl&gt  set  to  0).	An  optional &ltlimitttl&gt can be used to
	      specify that results hitting a sizelimit should also  be	cached
	      for  the	specified amount of time.  Results hitting a sizelimit
	      are not cached by default (&ltlimitttl&gt set to  0).   An  optional
	      &ltttr&gt  "time  to	refresh"  can  be  used to specify that cached
	      entries should be automatically refreshed after a certain  time.
	      Entries  will  only be refreshed while they have not expired, so
	      the &ltttl&gt should be larger than the &ltttr&gt for this option to  be
	      useful. Entries are not refreshed by default (&ltttr&gt set to 0).


       pcacheBind &ltfilter_template&gt &ltattrset_index&gt &ltttr&gt &ltscope&gt &ltbase&gt
	      Specifies  a  template for caching Simple Bind credentials based
	      on an already defined pcacheTemplate. The  &ltfilter_template&gt  is
	      similar to a &lttemplate_string&gt except that it may have some val-
	      ues present. Its purpose is to allow  the  overlay  to  generate
	      filters  similar	to  what  other applications do when they do a
	      Search immediately  before  a  Bind.  E.g.,  if  a  client  like
	      nss_ldap	is  configured	to  search  for a user with the filter
	      "(&(objectClass=posixAccount)(uid=&ltusername&gt))" then the	corre-
	      sponding	template  "(&(objectClass=posixAccount)(uid=))" should
	      be  used	here.  When  converted	to  a  regular	template  e.g.
	      "(&(objectClass=)(uid=))"  this template and the &ltattrset_index&gt
	      must match an already defined pcacheTemplate clause.  The  "time
	      to  refresh"  &ltttr&gt determines the time interval after which the
	      cached credentials may be refreshed. The first Bind request that
	      occurs  after  that  time  will  trigger	the  refresh  attempt.
	      Refreshes are not performed when the overlay is  Offline.  There
	      is  no  "time  to  live" parameter for the Bind credentials; the
	      credentials will expire according to the pcacheTemplate ttl. The
	      &ltscope&gt  and  &ltbase&gt should match the search scope and base used
	      by the authentication clients. The cached  credentials  are  not
	      stored  in cleartext, they are hashed using the default password
	      hash.  By default Bind caching is not enabled.


       pcachePosition { head | tail }
	      Specifies whether the response callback should be placed at  the
	      tail (the default) or at the head (actually, wherever the stack-
	      ing sequence would make it appear) of the callback  list.   This
	      affects how the overlay interacts with other overlays, since the
	      proxycache overlay should be executed as early as possible  (and
	      thus  configured as late as possible), to get a chance to return
	      the cached results; however, if executed early at  response,  it
	      would  cache entries that may be later "massaged" by other data-
	      bases and thus returned after  massaging	the  first  time,  and
	      before massaging when cached.


       There are some constraints:

	      all values must be positive;

	      &ltentry_limit&gt must be less than or equal to &ltmax_entries&gt;

	      &ltnumattrsets&gt  attribute	sets  SHOULD  be  defined by using the
	      directive pcacheAttrset;

	      all attribute sets SHOULD be referenced by (at least)  one  pca-
	      cheTemplate directive;


       The  following  adds a template with filter string (&(sn=)(givenName=))
       and attributes mail, postaladdress, telephonenumber  and  a  TTL  of  1
       hour.

	      pcacheAttrset 0 mail postaladdress telephonenumber
	      pcacheTemplate (&(sn=)(givenName=)) 0 3600


       Directives  for configuring the underlying database must also be given,
       as shown here:

	      directory /var/tmp/cache
	      cachesize 100

       Any valid directives for the chosen database type may be used. Indexing
       should  be  used as appropriate for the queries being handled. In addi-
       tion, an equality index on the pcacheQueryid attribute should  be  con-
       figured, to assist in the removal of expired query data.

BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY
       The configuration keywords have been renamed and the older form is dep-
       recated. These older keywords are still recognized but may disappear in
       future releases.

CAVEATS
       Caching	data is prone to inconsistencies because updates on the remote
       server will not be reflected in the response of the cache at least (and
       at  most)  for the duration of the pcacheTemplate TTL.  These inconsis-
       tencies can be minimized by careful use of the TTR.

       The remote server should expose the objectClass attribute  because  the
       underlying  database  that  actually caches the entries may need it for
       optimal local processing of the queries.

       The proxy server should contain all the schema information required for
       caching.   Significantly, it needs the schema of attributes used in the
       query templates.  If the objectClass attribute is used in a query  tem-
       plate,  it  needs the definition of the objectClasses of the entries it
       is supposed to cache.  It is the responsibility of the  proxy  adminis-
       trator  to  keep  the  proxy  schema  lined up with that of the proxied
       server.

       Another potential (and subtle) inconsistency may  occur	when  data  is
       retrieved  with	different  identities and specific per-identity access
       control is enforced by the remote server.  If data was  retrieved  with
       an identity that collected only partial results because of access rules
       enforcement on the remote server, other	users  with  different	access
       privileges  on  the  remote  server will get different results from the
       remote server and from the cache.  If those users  have	higher	access
       privileges  on  the  remote server, they will get from the cache only a
       subset of the results they would get directly from the  remote  server;
       but  if they have lower access privileges, they will get from the cache
       a superset of the results they  would  get  directly  from  the	remote
       server.	 Either  occurrence may or may not be acceptable, based on the
       security policy of the cache and of the remote server.  It is important
       to  note  that  in this case the proxy is violating the security of the
       remote server by disclosing to an identity data that was  collected  by
       another	identity.   For  this reason, it is suggested that, when using
       back-ldap, proxy caching be  used  in  conjunction  with  the  identity
       assertion  feature  of  slapd-ldap(5)  (see  the  idassert-bind and the
       idassert-authz statements), so that remote server interrogation	occurs
       with  a	vanilla identity that has some relatively high search and read
       access privileges, and the "real" access control is  delegated  to  the
       proxy's	ACLs.	Beware that since only the cached fraction of the real
       datum is available to the cache, it may not be possible to enforce  the
       same access rules that are defined on the remote server.  When security
       is a concern, cached proxy access must be carefully tailored.
