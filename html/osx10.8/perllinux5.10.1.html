NAME
       README.linux - Perl version 5 on Linux systems

DESCRIPTION
       This document describes various features of Linux that will affect how
       Perl version 5 (hereafter just Perl) is compiled and/or runs.

   Experimental Support for Sun Studio Compilers for Linux OS
       Sun Microsystems has released a port of their Sun Studio compiliers for
       Linux.  As of November 2005, only an alpha version has been released.
       Until a release of these compilers is made, support for compiling Perl
       with these compiler experimental.

       Also, some special instructions for building Perl with Sun Studio on
       Linux.  Following the normal "Configure", you have to run make as
       follows:

	   LDLOADLIBS=-lc make

       "LDLOADLIBS" is an environment variable used by the linker to link
       modules "/ext" modules to glibc.  Currently, that environment variable
       is not getting populated by a combination of "Config" entries and
       "ExtUtil::MakeMaker".  While there may be a bug somewhere in Perl's
       configuration or "ExtUtil::MakeMaker" causing the problem, the most
       likely cause is an incomplete understanding of Sun Studio by this
       author.	Further investigation is needed to get this working better.
