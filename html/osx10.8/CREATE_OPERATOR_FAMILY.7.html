CREATE OPERATOR FAMILY(7PostgreSQL 9.1.4 DocumentatioCREATE OPERATOR FAMILY(7)



NAME
       CREATE_OPERATOR_FAMILY - define a new operator family

SYNOPSIS
       CREATE OPERATOR FAMILY name USING index_method

DESCRIPTION
       CREATE OPERATOR FAMILY creates a new operator family. An operator
       family defines a collection of related operator classes, and perhaps
       some additional operators and support functions that are compatible
       with these operator classes but not essential for the functioning of
       any individual index. (Operators and functions that are essential to
       indexes should be grouped within the relevant operator class, rather
       than being "loose" in the operator family. Typically, single-data-type
       operators are bound to operator classes, while cross-data-type
       operators can be loose in an operator family containing operator
       classes for both data types.)

       The new operator family is initially empty. It should be populated by
       issuing subsequent CREATE OPERATOR CLASS commands to add contained
       operator classes, and optionally ALTER OPERATOR FAMILY commands to add
       "loose" operators and their corresponding support functions.

       If a schema name is given then the operator family is created in the
       specified schema. Otherwise it is created in the current schema. Two
       operator families in the same schema can have the same name only if
       they are for different index methods.

       The user who defines an operator family becomes its owner. Presently,
       the creating user must be a superuser. (This restriction is made
       because an erroneous operator family definition could confuse or even
       crash the server.)

       Refer to Section 35.14, "Interfacing Extensions To Indexes", in the
       documentation for further information.

PARAMETERS
       name
	   The name of the operator family to be created. The name can be
	   schema-qualified.

       index_method
	   The name of the index method this operator family is for.

COMPATIBILITY
       CREATE OPERATOR FAMILY is a PostgreSQL extension. There is no CREATE
       OPERATOR FAMILY statement in the SQL standard.
