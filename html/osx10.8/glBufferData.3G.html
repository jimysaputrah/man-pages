NAME
       glBufferData - creates and initializes a buffer object's data store

C SPECIFICATION
       void glBufferData(GLenum target, GLsizeiptr size, const GLvoid * data,
			 GLenum usage);

PARAMETERS
       target
	   Specifies the target buffer object. The symbolic constant must be
	   GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, GL_COPY_READ_BUFFER, GL_COPY_WRITE_BUFFER,
	   GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, GL_PIXEL_PACK_BUFFER,
	   GL_PIXEL_UNPACK_BUFFER, GL_TEXTURE_BUFFER,
	   GL_TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_BUFFER, or GL_UNIFORM_BUFFER.

       size
	   Specifies the size in bytes of the buffer object's new data store.

       data
	   Specifies a pointer to data that will be copied into the data store
	   for initialization, or NULL if no data is to be copied.

       usage
	   Specifies the expected usage pattern of the data store. The
	   symbolic constant must be GL_STREAM_DRAW, GL_STREAM_READ,
	   GL_STREAM_COPY, GL_STATIC_DRAW, GL_STATIC_READ, GL_STATIC_COPY,
	   GL_DYNAMIC_DRAW, GL_DYNAMIC_READ, or GL_DYNAMIC_COPY.

DESCRIPTION
       glBufferData creates a new data store for the buffer object currently
       bound to target. Any pre-existing data store is deleted. The new data
       store is created with the specified size in bytes and usage. If data is
       not NULL, the data store is initialized with data from this pointer. In
       its initial state, the new data store is not mapped, it has a NULL
       mapped pointer, and its mapped access is GL_READ_WRITE.


       usage is a hint to the GL implementation as to how a buffer object's
       data store will be accessed. This enables the GL implementation to make
       more intelligent decisions that may significantly impact buffer object
       performance. It does not, however, constrain the actual usage of the
       data store.  usage can be broken down into two parts: first, the
       frequency of access (modification and usage), and second, the nature of
       that access. The frequency of access may be one of these:

       STREAM
	   The data store contents will be modified once and used at most a
	   few times.

       STATIC
	   The data store contents will be modified once and used many times.

       DYNAMIC
	   The data store contents will be modified repeatedly and used many
	   times.

       The nature of access may be one of these:

       DRAW
	   The data store contents are modified by the application, and used
	   as the source for GL drawing and image specification commands.

       READ
	   The data store contents are modified by reading data from the GL,
	   and used to return that data when queried by the application.

       COPY
	   The data store contents are modified by reading data from the GL,
	   and used as the source for GL drawing and image specification
	   commands.

NOTES
       If data is NULL, a data store of the specified size is still created,
       but its contents remain uninitialized and thus undefined.

       Clients must align data elements consistent with the requirements of
       the client platform, with an additional base-level requirement that an
       offset within a buffer to a datum comprising N bytes be a multiple of
       N.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if target is not one of the accepted
       buffer targets.


       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if usage is not GL_STREAM_DRAW,
       GL_STREAM_READ, GL_STREAM_COPY, GL_STATIC_DRAW, GL_STATIC_READ,
       GL_STATIC_COPY, GL_DYNAMIC_DRAW, GL_DYNAMIC_READ, or GL_DYNAMIC_COPY.


       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if size is negative.


       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if the reserved buffer object name 0
       is bound to target.


       GL_OUT_OF_MEMORY is generated if the GL is unable to create a data
       store with the specified size.

ASSOCIATED GETS
       glGetBufferSubData()


       glGetBufferParameter() with argument GL_BUFFER_SIZE or GL_BUFFER_USAGE
