NAME
       App::Prove::State::Result - Individual test suite results.

VERSION
       Version 3.17

DESCRIPTION
       The "prove" command supports a "--state" option that instructs it to
       store persistent state across runs. This module encapsulates the
       results for a single test suite run.

SYNOPSIS
	   # Re-run failed tests
	   $ prove --state=fail,save -rbv

METHODS
   Class Methods
       "new"

	   my $result = App::Prove::State::Result-&gtnew({
	       generation =&gt $generation,
	       tests	  =&gt \%tests,
	   });

       Returns a new "App::Prove::State::Result" instance.

   "state_version"
       Returns the current version of state storage.

   "test_class"
       Returns the name of the class used for tracking individual tests.  This
       class should either subclass from "App::Prove::State::Result::Test" or
       provide an identical interface.

       "generation"

       Getter/setter for the "generation" of the test suite run. The first
       generation is 1 (one) and subsequent generations are 2, 3, etc.

       "last_run_time"

       Getter/setter for the time of the test suite run.

       "tests"

       Returns the tests for a given generation. This is a hashref or a hash,
       depending on context called. The keys to the hash are the individual
       test names and the value is a hashref with various interesting values.
       Each k/v pair might resemble something like this:

	't/foo.t' =&gt {
	   elapsed	  =&gt '0.0428488254547119',
	   gen		  =&gt '7',
	   last_pass_time =&gt '1219328376.07815',
	   last_result	  =&gt '0',
	   last_run_time  =&gt '1219328376.07815',
	   last_todo	  =&gt '0',
	   mtime	  =&gt '1191708862',
	   seq		  =&gt '192',
	   total_passes   =&gt '6',
	 }

       "test"

	my $test = $result-&gttest('t/customer/create.t');

       Returns an individual "App::Prove::State::Result::Test" instance for
       the given test name (usually the filename).  Will return a new
       "App::Prove::State::Result::Test" instance if the name is not found.

       "test_names"

       Returns an list of test names, sorted by run order.

       "remove"

	$result-&gtremove($test_name);		# remove the test
	my $test = $result-&gttest($test_name);	# fatal error

       Removes a given test from results.  This is a no-op if the test name is
       not found.

       "num_tests"

       Returns the number of tests for a given test suite result.

       "raw"

       Returns a hashref of raw results, suitable for serialization by YAML.
