NAME
       Term::ReadLine - Perl interface to various "readline" packages.	If no
       real package is found, substitutes stubs instead of basic functions.

SYNOPSIS
	 use Term::ReadLine;
	 my $term = Term::ReadLine->new('Simple Perl calc');
	 my $prompt = "Enter your arithmetic expression: ";
	 my $OUT = $term->OUT || \*STDOUT;
	 while ( defined ($_ = $term->readline($prompt)) ) {
	   my $res = eval($_);
	   warn $@ if $@;
	   print $OUT $res, "\n" unless $@;
	   $term->addhistory($_) if /\S/;
	 }

DESCRIPTION
       This package is just a front end to some other packages. It's a stub to
       set up a common interface to the various ReadLine implementations found
       on CPAN (under the "Term::ReadLine::*" namespace).

Minimal set of supported functions
       All the supported functions should be called as methods, i.e., either
       as

	 $term = Term::ReadLine->new('name');

       or as

	 $term->addhistory('row');

       where $term is a return value of Term::ReadLine->new().

       "ReadLine"  returns the actual package that executes the commands.
		   Among possible values are "Term::ReadLine::Gnu",
		   "Term::ReadLine::Perl", "Term::ReadLine::Stub".

       "new"	   returns the handle for subsequent calls to following
		   functions. Argument is the name of the application.
		   Optionally can be followed by two arguments for "IN" and
		   "OUT" filehandles. These arguments should be globs.

       "readline"  gets an input line, possibly with actual "readline"
		   support. Trailing newline is removed. Returns "undef" on
		   "EOF".

       "addhistory"
		   adds the line to the history of input, from where it can be
		   used if the actual "readline" is present.

       "IN", "OUT" return the filehandles for input and output or "undef" if
		   "readline" input and output cannot be used for Perl.

       "MinLine"   If argument is specified, it is an advice on minimal size
		   of line to be included into history.  "undef" means do not
		   include anything into history. Returns the old value.

       "findConsole"
		   returns an array with two strings that give most
		   appropriate names for files for input and output using
		   conventions "<$in", ">out".

       Attribs	   returns a reference to a hash which describes internal
		   configuration of the package. Names of keys in this hash
		   conform to standard conventions with the leading "rl_"
		   stripped.

       "Features"  Returns a reference to a hash with keys being features
		   present in current implementation. Several optional
		   features are used in the minimal interface: "appname"
		   should be present if the first argument to "new" is
		   recognized, and "minline" should be present if "MinLine"
		   method is not dummy.  "autohistory" should be present if
		   lines are put into history automatically (maybe subject to
		   "MinLine"), and "addhistory" if "addhistory" method is not
		   dummy.

		   If "Features" method reports a feature "attribs" as
		   present, the method "Attribs" is not dummy.

Additional supported functions
       Actually "Term::ReadLine" can use some other package, that will support
       a richer set of commands.

       All these commands are callable via method interface and have names
       which conform to standard conventions with the leading "rl_" stripped.

       The stub package included with the perl distribution allows some
       additional methods:

       "tkRunning" makes Tk event loop run when waiting for user input (i.e.,
		   during "readline" method).

       "ornaments" makes the command line stand out by using termcap data.
		   The argument to "ornaments" should be 0, 1, or a string of
		   a form "aa,bb,cc,dd".  Four components of this string
		   should be names of terminal capacities, first two will be
		   issued to make the prompt standout, last two to make the
		   input line standout.

       "newTTY"    takes two arguments which are input filehandle and output
		   filehandle.	Switches to use these filehandles.

       One can check whether the currently loaded ReadLine package supports
       these methods by checking for corresponding "Features".

EXPORTS
       None

ENVIRONMENT
       The environment variable "PERL_RL" governs which ReadLine clone is
       loaded. If the value is false, a dummy interface is used. If the value
       is true, it should be tail of the name of the package to use, such as
       "Perl" or "Gnu".

       As a special case, if the value of this variable is space-separated,
       the tail might be used to disable the ornaments by setting the tail to
       be "o=0" or "ornaments=0".  The head should be as described above, say

       If the variable is not set, or if the head of space-separated list is
       empty, the best available package is loaded.

	 export "PERL_RL=Perl o=0"     # Use Perl ReadLine without ornaments
	 export "PERL_RL= o=0"	       # Use best available ReadLine without ornaments

       (Note that processing of "PERL_RL" for ornaments is in the discretion
       of the particular used "Term::ReadLine::*" package).

CAVEATS
       It seems that using Term::ReadLine from Emacs minibuffer doesn't work
       quite right and one will get an error message like

	   Cannot open /dev/tty for read at ...

       One possible workaround for this is to explicitly open /dev/tty like
       this

	   open (FH, "/dev/tty" )
	     or eval 'sub Term::ReadLine::findConsole { ("&STDIN", "&STDERR") }';
	   die $@ if $@;
	   close (FH);

       or you can try using the 4-argument form of Term::ReadLine->new().
