NAME
       IP::Country::Medium - cached lookup of country codes by IP address and
       domain name

SYNOPSIS
	 use IP::Country::Medium;

DESCRIPTION
       See documentation for IP::Country. In addition, IP::Country::Medium
       objects have a cache() method, which controls whether hostname-&gtcc
       lookups are cached (on by default).

       $ic-&gtcache(BOOLEAN)
	   By default, the module caches results of country-code lookups. This
	   feature can be switched off by setting cache to a false value
	   (zero, empty string or undef), and can be switched on again by
	   setting cache to a true value (anything which isn't false).

	     $ic-&gtcache(0); # clears and disables cache
	     $ic-&gtcache(1); # enables the cache

	   The cache is formed at the class level, so any change in caching in
	   one object will affect all objectcs of this class. Turning off the
	   cache also clears the cache.
