       void glMap2d( GLenum target,
		     GLdouble u1,
		     GLdouble u2,
		     GLint ustride,
		     GLint uorder,

		     GLint vorder,
		     const GLfloat *points )


PARAMETERS
       target	Specifies the kind of values that are generated by the evalua-
		tor.  Symbolic constants  GL_MAP2_VERTEX_3,  GL_MAP2_VERTEX_4,
		GL_MAP2_INDEX,	       GL_MAP2_COLOR_4,        GL_MAP2_NORMAL,
		GL_MAP2_TEXTURE_COORD_1,	      GL_MAP2_TEXTURE_COORD_2,
		GL_MAP2_TEXTURE_COORD_3,   and	 GL_MAP2_TEXTURE_COORD_4   are
		accepted.

       u1, u2	Specify a linear mapping of u, as presented  to  glEvalCoord2,
		to  u  hat, one of the two variables that are evaluated by the
		equations specified by this command. Initially, u1 is 0 and u2
		is 1.

       ustride	Specifies  the	number of floats or doubles between the begin-
		ning of control point Rij and the beginning of	control  point
		R(i+1)j , where i and j are the u and v control point indices,
		respectively.  This allows control points to  be  embedded  in
		arbitrary  data  structures.   The only constraint is that the
		values for a particular control point must  occupy  contiguous
		memory locations. The initial value of ustride is 0.

       uorder	Specifies  the	dimension  of the control point array in the u
		axis.  Must be positive. The initial value is 1.

       v1, v2	Specify a linear mapping of v, as presented  to  glEvalCoord2,
		to  v  hat, one of the two variables that are evaluated by the
		equations specified by this command. Initially, v1 is 0 and v2
		is 1.

       vstride	Specifies  the	number of floats or doubles between the begin-
		ning of control point Rij and the beginning of	control  point
		Ri(j+1),  where i and j are the u and v control point indices,
		respectively.  This allows control points to  be  embedded  in
		arbitrary  data  structures.   The only constraint is that the
		values for a particular control point must  occupy  contiguous
		memory locations. The initial value of vstride is 0.

       vorder	Specifies  the	dimension  of the control point array in the v
		axis.  Must be positive. The initial value is 1.

       points	Specifies a pointer to the array of control points.

DESCRIPTION
       Evaluators provide a way to use polynomial or rational polynomial  map-
       ping  to  produce  vertices,  normals, texture coordinates, and colors.
       The values produced by an evaluator are sent on to further stages of GL
       processing just as if they had been presented using glVertex, glNormal,
       glTexCoord, and glColor commands, except that the generated  values  do
       not update the current normal, texture coordinates, or color.

       All  polynomial or rational polynomial splines of any degree (up to the
       maximum degree supported by the GL  implementation)  can  be  described
       using  evaluators.   These include almost all surfaces used in computer
       graphics, including B-spline surfaces, NURBS surfaces, Bezier surfaces,
       and so on.

       Evaluators  define  surfaces  based on bivariate Bernstein polynomials.
       Define p ( u hat , v hat ) as

       p(u hat, v hat) = Sum(i=0 to n) Sum(j=0 to n)  Bi^n  (u	hat)  Bj^m  (v
				      hat) Rij

       where  Rij is a control point, Bi^n(u hat) is the ith Bernstein polyno-
       mial of degree
       n (uorder = n + 1)

		Bi^n ( u hat ) = (n,i) (u hat)^i (1 - u hat) ^ (n-1)


       and Bj^m ( v hat ) is the jth Bernstein polynomial of degree m  (vorder
       = m + 1)

		Bj^m ( u hat ) = (m,j) (v hat)^j (1 - b hat) ^ (m-j)

       Recall that

			      0^0 == 1	and (0,n) == 1

       glMap2  is  used to define the basis and to specify what kind of values
       are produced.  Once defined, a map can be enabled and disabled by call-
       ing  glEnable  and  glDisable with the map name, one of the nine prede-
       fined values for target, described below.  When	glEvalCoord2  presents
       values u and v, the bivariate Bernstein polynomials are evaluated using
       u hat and v hat, where

			       u hat = (u-u1)/(u2-u1)

			       v hat = (v-v1)/(v2-v1)

       target is a symbolic constant  that  indicates  what  kind  of  control
       points  are  provided  in points, and what output is generated when the
       map is evaluated.  It can assume one of nine predefined values:

       GL_MAP2_VERTEX_3 	Each control  point  is  three	floating-point
				values	representing  x,  y,  and z.  Internal
				glVertex3 commands are generated when the  map
				is evaluated.

       GL_MAP2_VERTEX_4 	Each control point is four floating-point val-
				ues representing x, y,	z,  and  w.   Internal
				glVertex4  commands are generated when the map
				is evaluated.

       GL_MAP2_INDEX		Each control point is a single	floating-point
				value  representing  a	color index.  Internal
				glIndex commands are generated when the map is
				evaluated but the current index is not updated
				with the value of these glIndex commands.

       GL_MAP2_COLOR_4		Each control point is four floating-point val-
				ues  representing red, green, blue, and alpha.
				Internal glColor4 commands are generated  when
				the  map is evaluated but the current color is
				not updated with the value of  these  glColor4
				commands.

       GL_MAP2_NORMAL		Each  control  point  is  three floating-point
				values representing the x, y, and z components
				of  a  normal  vector.	Internal glNormal com-
				mands are generated when the map is  evaluated
				but the current normal is not updated with the
				value of these glNormal commands.

       GL_MAP2_TEXTURE_COORD_1	Each control point is a single	floating-point
				value  representing  the s texture coordinate.
				Internal
				glTexCoord1 commands are  generated  when  the
				map is evaluated but the current texture coor-
				dinates are not  updated  with	the  value  of
				these glTexCoord commands.

       GL_MAP2_TEXTURE_COORD_2	Each  control point is two floating-point val-
				ues representing the s and t  texture  coordi-
				nates.	Internal
				glTexCoord2  commands  are  generated when the
				map is evaluated but the current texture coor-
				dinates  are  not  updated  with  the value of
				these glTexCoord commands.

       GL_MAP2_TEXTURE_COORD_3	Each control  point  is  three	floating-point
				values	representing  the  s, t, and r texture
				coordinates.   Internal  glTexCoord3  commands
				are  generated	when  the map is evaluated but
				the  current  texture  coordinates   are   not
				updated  with  the  value  of these glTexCoord
				commands.

       GL_MAP2_TEXTURE_COORD_4	Each control point is four floating-point val-
				ues  representing  the	s, t, r, and q texture
				coordinates.  Internal
				glTexCoord4 commands are  generated  when  the
				map is evaluated but the current texture coor-
				dinates are not  updated  with	the  value  of
				these glTexCoord commands.

       ustride,  uorder, vstride, vorder, and points define the array address-
       ing for accessing the control points.  points is the  location  of  the
       first control point, which occupies one, two, three, or four contiguous
       memory locations, depending on which map is being defined.   There  are
       uorder*vorder  control points in the array.  ustride specifies how many
       float or double locations are skipped to advance  the  internal	memory
       pointer from control point Rij to control point R(i+1)j.  vstride spec-
       ifies how many float or double locations are  skipped  to  advance  the
       internal  memory  pointer  from	control  point	Rij  to  control point
       Ri(j+1).

NOTES
       As is the case with all GL commands that accept pointers to data, it is
       as  if  the  contents  of  points  were	copied by glMap2 before glMap2
       returns.  Changes to the contents of points have no effect after glMap2
       is called.

       Initially,  GL_AUTO_NORMAL  is  enabled.  If GL_AUTO_NORMAL is enabled,
       normal  vectors	are  generated	 when	either	 GL_MAP2_VERTEX_3   or
       GL_MAP2_VERTEX_4 is used to generate vertices.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if target is not an accepted value.

       GL_INVALID_VALUE  is  generated if u1 is equal to u2, or if v1 is equal
       to v2.

       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if either ustride or vstride is less than
       the number of values in a control point.

       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if either uorder or vorder is less than 1
       or greater than the return value of GL_MAX_EVAL_ORDER.

       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if glMap2  is	executed  between  the
       execution of glBegin and the corresponding execution of glEnd.

       When	the	GL_ARB_multitexture	extension     is    supported,
       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if glMap2 is called and the value  of
       GL_ACTIVE_TEXTURE_ARB is not GL_TEXTURE0_ARB.
