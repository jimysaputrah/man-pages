NAME
       XS::APItest::KeywordRPN - write arithmetic expressions in RPN

SYNOPSIS
	       use XS::APItest::KeywordRPN qw(rpn calcrpn);

	       $triangle = rpn($n $n 1 + * 2 /);

	       calcrpn $triangle { $n $n 1 + * 2 / }

DESCRIPTION
       This module supplies plugged-in keywords, using the new mechanism in
       Perl 5.11.2, that allow arithmetic to be expressed in reverse Polish
       notation, in an otherwise Perl program.	This module has serious
       limitations and is not intended for real use: its purpose is only to
       test the keyword plugin mechanism.  For that purpose it is part of the
       Perl core source distribution, and is not meant to be installed.

   RPN expression syntax
       Tokens of an RPN expression may be separated by whitespace, but such
       separation is usually not required.  It is required only where
       unseparated tokens would look like a longer token.  For example, "12 34
       +" can be written as "12 34+", but not as "1234 +".

       An RPN expression may be any of:

       1234
	   A sequence of digits is an unsigned decimal literal number.

       $foo
	   An alphanumeric name preceded by dollar sign refers to a Perl
	   scalar variable.  Only variables declared with "my" or "state" are
	   supported.  If the variable's value is not a native integer, it
	   will be converted to an integer, by Perl's usual mechanisms, at the
	   time it is evaluated.

       A B "+"
	   Sum of A and B.

       A B "-"
	   Difference of A and B, the result of subtracting B from A.

       A B "*"
	   Product of A and B.

       A B "/"
	   Quotient when A is divided by B, rounded towards zero.  Division by
	   zero generates an exception.

       A B "%"
	   Remainder when A is divided by B with the quotient rounded towards
	   zero.  Division by zero generates an exception.

       Because the arithmetic operators all have fixed arity and are
       postfixed, there is no need for operator precedence, nor for a grouping
       operator to override precedence.  This is half of the point of RPN.

       An RPN expression can also be interpreted in another way, as a sequence
       of operations on a stack, one operation per token.  A literal or
       variable token pushes a value onto the stack.  A binary operator pulls
       two items off the stack, performs a calculation with them, and pushes
       the result back onto the stack.	The stack starts out empty, and at the
       end of the expression there must be exactly one value left on the
       stack.

OPERATORS
       These are the operators being added to the Perl language.

       rpn(EXPRESSION)
	   This construct is a Perl expression.  EXPRESSION must be an RPN
	   arithmetic expression, as described above.  The RPN expression is
	   evaluated, and its value is returned as the value of the Perl
	   expression.

       calcrpn VARIABLE { EXPRESSION }
	   This construct is a complete Perl statement.  (No semicolon should
	   follow the closing brace.)  VARIABLE must be a Perl scalar "my"
	   variable, and EXPRESSION must be an RPN arithmetic expression as
	   described above.  The RPN expression is evaluated, and its value is
	   assigned to the variable.

BUGS
       This module only performs arithmetic on native integers, and only a
       small subset of the arithmetic operations that Perl offers.  This is
       due to it being intended only for demonstration and test purposes.

       The RPN parser is liable to leak memory when a parse error occurs.  It
       doesn't leak on success, however.
