NAME
     fenv -- functions providing access to the floating-point environment

SYNOPSIS
     #include &ltfenv.h&gt
     #pragma STDC FENV_ACCESS ON

DESCRIPTION
     The header &ltfenv.h&gt declares types, macros, and functions to provide
     access to the floating-point environment, consisting of any floating-
     point status flags and control modes supported by the implementation.  A
     floating-point status flag is a variable whose value is set (but not
     cleared) when a floating-point exception is raised, which occurs as a
     side effect of floating-point arithmetic when an exceptional condition is
     encountered. A floating-point control mode is a variable whose value may
     be set by the user to affect the subsequent behavior of floating-point
     arithmetic.

     Certain conventions are expected as part of the intended model for inter-
     action with the floating-point environment:
	   o   A function does not alter its caller's floating-point control
	       modes, clear its caller's floating-point status flags, nor
	       depend on the state of its caller's floating-point status flags
	       unless the function is so documented.
	   o   A function is assumed to require default floating-point control
	       modes unless its documentation promises otherwise.
	   o   A function is assumed to have the potential for raising float-
	       ing-point exceptions unless its documentation promises other-
	       wise.
     Programmers should adhere to these guidelines in their usage of the func-
     tions defined in &ltfenv.h&gt.  Failure to do so may result in bugs which are
     extraordinarily hard to diagnose.

     Note that any usage of the functions provided by &ltfenv.h&gt should occur
     within the scope of

	   #pragma STDC FENV_ACCESS ON

     The FENV_ACCESS pragma provides a means to inform the compiler that the
     program might access the floating-point environment to test status flags
     or change the control modes.  The pragma shall occur either outside
     external declarations (i.e.  at file scope) or preceeding all explicit
     declarations and statements inside a compound statement.  If part of a
     program tests floating-point status flags or sets control modes, but was
     translated with FENV_ACCESS "off", the behavior of that program is unde-
     fined.

     The types fenv_t and fexcept_t represent the entire floating-point envi-
     ronment and the floating-point status flags, respectively.  These should
     be treated as opaque types, and be manipulated only via the functions
     defined in &ltfenv.h&gt.

     The macros FE_INVALID, FE_DIVBYZERO, FE_OVERFLOW, FE_UNDERFLOW, and
     FE_INEXACT expand to integer constant expressions such that bitwise ORs
     of any combination of the macros result in distinct values and bitwise
     ANDs of any combinations of the macros results in zero.  These macros are
     used in functions defined in &ltfenv.h&gt to represent floating-point excep-
     tions and status flags.  Additionally, the macro FE_ALL_EXCEPT is defined
     to be the bitwise OR of all floating-point exception macros defined by
     the implementation.

     The macros FE_TONEAREST, FE_TOWARDZERO, FE_DOWNWARD, and FE_UPWARD expand
     to integer constant expressions whose values are distinct nonnegative
     numbers.  These are intended for use with the fesetround() and
     fegetround() functions for control of the floating-point rounding modes.

     The macro FE_DFL_ENV represents the default floating-point environ-
     ment--the one installed at program startup--and expands to a pointer to a
     const fenv_t object.  It can be used as an argument to &ltfenv.h&gt functions
     that manage the floating-point environment.

     The feclearexcept(), feraiseexcept(), fetestexcept(), fegetexceptflag(),
     and fesetexceptflag() functions provide access to the floating-point sta-
     tus flags.

     The fegetround() and fesetround() functions provide control of rounding
     direction modes.

     The fegetenv(), feholdexcept(), fesetenv(), and feupdateenv() functions
     provide control of the entire floating-point environment as an abstract
     object.

     Further documentation for all of these functions is available in their
     respective manpages, and also in section 7.6 of the C standard.
