NAME
       Pod::Select, podselect() - extract selected sections of POD from input

SYNOPSIS
	   use Pod::Select;

	   ## Select all the POD sections for each file in @filelist
	   ## and print the result on standard output.
	   podselect(@filelist);

	   ## Same as above, but write to tmp.out
	   podselect({-output => "tmp.out"}, @filelist):

	   ## Select from the given filelist, only those POD sections that are
	   ## within a 1st level section named any of: NAME, SYNOPSIS, OPTIONS.
	   podselect({-sections => ["NAME|SYNOPSIS", "OPTIONS"]}, @filelist):

	   ## Select the "DESCRIPTION" section of the PODs from STDIN and write
	   ## the result to STDERR.
	   podselect({-output => ">&STDERR", -sections => ["DESCRIPTION"]}, \*STDIN);

       or

	   use Pod::Select;

	   ## Create a parser object for selecting POD sections from the input
	   $parser = new Pod::Select();

	   ## Select all the POD sections for each file in @filelist
	   ## and print the result to tmp.out.
	   $parser->parse_from_file("<&STDIN", "tmp.out");

	   ## Select from the given filelist, only those POD sections that are
	   ## within a 1st level section named any of: NAME, SYNOPSIS, OPTIONS.
	   $parser->select("NAME|SYNOPSIS", "OPTIONS");
	   for (@filelist) { $parser->parse_from_file($_); }

	   ## Select the "DESCRIPTION" and "SEE ALSO" sections of the PODs from
	   ## STDIN and write the result to STDERR.
	   $parser->select("DESCRIPTION");
	   $parser->add_selection("SEE ALSO");
	   $parser->parse_from_filehandle(\*STDIN, \*STDERR);

EXPORTS
       podselect()

DESCRIPTION
       podselect() is a function which will extract specified sections of pod
       documentation from an input stream. This ability is provided by the
       Pod::Select module which is a subclass of Pod::Parser.  Pod::Select
       provides a method named select() to specify the set of POD sections to
       select for processing/printing. podselect() merely creates a
       Pod::Select object and then invokes the podselect() followed by
       parse_from_file().

SECTION SPECIFICATIONS
       podselect() and Pod::Select::select() may be given one or more "section
       specifications" to restrict the text processed to only the desired set
       of sections and their corresponding subsections.  A section
       specification is a string containing one or more Perl-style regular
       expressions separated by forward slashes ("/").	If you need to use a
       forward slash literally within a section title you can escape it with a
       backslash ("\/").

       The formal syntax of a section specification is:

       o   head1-title-regex/head2-title-regex/...

       Any omitted or empty regular expressions will default to ".*".  Please
       note that each regular expression given is implicitly anchored by
       adding "^" and "$" to the beginning and end.  Also, if a given regular
       expression starts with a "!" character, then the expression is negated
       (so "!foo" would match anything except "foo").

       Some example section specifications follow.

       o   Match the "NAME" and "SYNOPSIS" sections and all of their
	   subsections:

	   "NAME|SYNOPSIS"

       o   Match only the "Question" and "Answer" subsections of the
	   "DESCRIPTION" section:

	   "DESCRIPTION/Question|Answer"

       o   Match the "Comments" subsection of all sections:

	   "/Comments"

       o   Match all subsections of "DESCRIPTION" except for "Comments":

	   "DESCRIPTION/!Comments"

       o   Match the "DESCRIPTION" section but do not match any of its
	   subsections:

	   "DESCRIPTION/!.+"

       o   Match all top level sections but none of their subsections:

	   "/!.+"

OBJECT METHODS
       The following methods are provided in this module. Each one takes a
       reference to the object itself as an implicit first parameter.

curr_headings()
		   ($head1, $head2, $head3, ...) = $parser->curr_headings();
		   $head1 = $parser->curr_headings(1);

       This method returns a list of the currently active section headings and
       subheadings in the document being parsed. The list of headings returned
       corresponds to the most recently parsed paragraph of the input.

       If an argument is given, it must correspond to the desired section
       heading number, in which case only the specified section heading is
       returned. If there is no current section heading at the specified
       level, then "undef" is returned.

select()
		   $parser->select($section_spec1,$section_spec2,...);

       This method is used to select the particular sections and subsections
       of POD documentation that are to be printed and/or processed. The
       existing set of selected sections is replaced with the given set of
       sections.  See add_selection() for adding to the current set of
       selected sections.

       Each of the $section_spec arguments should be a section specification
       as described in "SECTION SPECIFICATIONS".  The section specifications
       are parsed by this method and the resulting regular expressions are
       stored in the invoking object.

       If no $section_spec arguments are given, then the existing set of
       selected sections is cleared out (which means "all" sections will be
       processed).

       This method should not normally be overridden by subclasses.

add_selection()
		   $parser->add_selection($section_spec1,$section_spec2,...);

       This method is used to add to the currently selected sections and
       subsections of POD documentation that are to be printed and/or
       processed. See <select()> for replacing the currently selected
       sections.

       Each of the $section_spec arguments should be a section specification
       as described in "SECTION SPECIFICATIONS". The section specifications
       are parsed by this method and the resulting regular expressions are
       stored in the invoking object.

       This method should not normally be overridden by subclasses.

clear_selections()
		   $parser->clear_selections();

       This method takes no arguments, it has the exact same effect as
       invoking <select()> with no arguments.

match_section()
		   $boolean = $parser->match_section($heading1,$heading2,...);

       Returns a value of true if the given section and subsection heading
       titles match any of the currently selected section specifications in
       effect from prior calls to select() and add_selection() (or if there
       are no explicitly selected/deselected sections).

       The arguments $heading1, $heading2, etc. are the heading titles of the
       corresponding sections, subsections, etc. to try and match.  If
       $headingN is omitted then it defaults to the current corresponding
       section heading title in the input.

       This method should not normally be overridden by subclasses.

is_selected()
		   $boolean = $parser->is_selected($paragraph);

       This method is used to determine if the block of text given in
       $paragraph falls within the currently selected set of POD sections and
       subsections to be printed or processed. This method is also responsible
       for keeping track of the current input section and subsections. It is
       assumed that $paragraph is the most recently read (but not yet
       processed) input paragraph.

       The value returned will be true if the $paragraph and the rest of the
       text in the same section as $paragraph should be selected (included)
       for processing; otherwise a false value is returned.

EXPORTED FUNCTIONS
       The following functions are exported by this module. Please note that
       these are functions (not methods) and therefore "do not" take an
       implicit first argument.

podselect()
		   podselect(\%options,@filelist);

       podselect will print the raw (untranslated) POD paragraphs of all POD
       sections in the given input files specified by @filelist according to
       the given options.

       If any argument to podselect is a reference to a hash (associative
       array) then the values with the following keys are processed as
       follows:

       -output
	   A string corresponding to the desired output file (or ">&STDOUT" or
	   ">&STDERR"). The default is to use standard output.

       -sections
	   A reference to an array of sections specifications (as described in
	   "SECTION SPECIFICATIONS") which indicate the desired set of POD
	   sections and subsections to be selected from input. If no section
	   specifications are given, then all sections of the PODs are used.

       All other arguments should correspond to the names of input files
       containing POD sections. A file name of "-" or "<&STDIN" will be
       interpreted to mean standard input (which is the default if no
       filenames are given).

PRIVATE METHODS AND DATA
       Pod::Select makes uses a number of internal methods and data fields
       which clients should not need to see or use. For the sake of avoiding
       name collisions with client data and methods, these methods and fields
       are briefly discussed here. Determined hackers may obtain further
       information about them by reading the Pod::Select source code.

       Private data fields are stored in the hash-object whose reference is
       returned by the new() constructor for this class. The names of all
       private methods and data-fields used by Pod::Select begin with a prefix
       of "_" and match the regular expression "/^_\w+$/".
