NAME
       glBeginQuery - delimit the boundaries of a query object

C SPECIFICATION
       void glBeginQuery(GLenum target, GLuint id);

PARAMETERS
       target
	   Specifies the target type of query object established between
	   glBeginQuery and the subsequent glEndQuery(). The symbolic constant
	   must be one of GL_SAMPLES_PASSED, GL_ANY_SAMPLES_PASSED,
	   GL_PRIMITIVES_GENERATED, GL_TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_PRIMITIVES_WRITTEN,
	   or GL_TIME_ELAPSED.

       id
	   Specifies the name of a query object.

C SPECIFICATION
       void glEndQuery(GLenum target);

PARAMETERS
       target
	   Specifies the target type of query object to be concluded. The
	   symbolic constant must be one of GL_SAMPLES_PASSED,
	   GL_ANY_SAMPLES_PASSED, GL_PRIMITIVES_GENERATED,
	   GL_TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_PRIMITIVES_WRITTEN, or GL_TIME_ELAPSED.

DESCRIPTION
       glBeginQuery and glEndQuery() delimit the boundaries of a query object.
       query must be a name previously returned from a call to glGenQueries().
       If a query object with name id does not yet exist it is created with
       the type determined by target.  target must be one of
       GL_SAMPLES_PASSED, GL_ANY_SAMPLES_PASSED, GL_PRIMITIVES_GENERATED,
       GL_TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_PRIMITIVES_WRITTEN, or GL_TIME_ELAPSED. The
       behavior of the query object depends on its type and is as follows.

       If target is GL_SAMPLES_PASSED, id must be an unused name, or the name
       of an existing occlusion query object. When glBeginQuery is executed,
       the query object's samples-passed counter is reset to 0. Subsequent
       rendering will increment the counter for every sample that passes the
       depth test. If the value of GL_SAMPLE_BUFFERS is 0, then the
       samples-passed count is incremented by 1 for each fragment. If the
       value of GL_SAMPLE_BUFFERS is 1, then the samples-passed count is
       incremented by the number of samples whose coverage bit is set.
       However, implementations, at their discression may instead increase the
       samples-passed count by the value of GL_SAMPLES if any sample in the
       fragment is covered. When glEndQuery is executed, the samples-passed
       counter is assigned to the query object's result value. This value can
       be queried by calling glGetQueryObject() with pname GL_QUERY_RESULT.

       If target is GL_ANY_SAMPLES_PASSED, id must be an unused name, or the
       name of an existing boolean occlusion query object. When glBeginQuery
       is executed, the query object's samples-passed flag is reset to
       GL_FALSE. Subsequent rendering causes the flag to be set to GL_TRUE if
       any sample passes the depth test. When glEndQuery is executed, the
       samples-passed flag is assigned to the query object's result value.
       This value can be queried by calling glGetQueryObject() with pname
       GL_QUERY_RESULT.

       If target is GL_PRIMITIVES_GENERATED, id must be an unused name, or the
       name of an existing primitive query object previously bound to the
       GL_PRIMITIVES_GENERATED query binding. When glBeginQuery is executed,
       the query object's primitives-generated counter is reset to 0.
       Subsequent rendering will increment the counter once for every vertex
       that is emitted from the geometry shader, or from the vertex shader if
       no geometry shader is present. When glEndQuery is executed, the
       primitives-generated counter is assigned to the query object's result
       value. This value can be queried by calling glGetQueryObject() with
       pname GL_QUERY_RESULT.

       If target is GL_TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_PRIMITIVES_WRITTEN, id must be an
       unused name, or the name of an existing primitive query object
       previously bound to the GL_TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_PRIMITIVES_WRITTEN query
       binding. When glBeginQuery is executed, the query object's
       primitives-written counter is reset to 0. Subsequent rendering will
       increment the counter once for every vertex that is written into the
       bound transform feedback buffer(s). If transform feedback mode is not
       activated between the call to glBeginQuery and glEndQuery, the counter
       will not be incremented. When glEndQuery is executed, the
       primitives-written counter is assigned to the query object's result
       value. This value can be queried by calling glGetQueryObject() with
       pname GL_QUERY_RESULT.

       If target is GL_TIME_ELAPSED, id must be an unused name, or the name of
       an existing timer query object previously bound to the GL_TIME_ELAPSED
       query binding. When glBeginQuery is executed, the query object's time
       counter is reset to 0. When glEndQuery is executed, the elapsed server
       time that has passed since the call to glBeginQuery is written into the
       query object's time counter. This value can be queried by calling
       glGetQueryObject() with pname GL_QUERY_RESULT.

       Querying the GL_QUERY_RESULT implicitly flushes the GL pipeline until
       the rendering delimited by the query object has completed and the
       result is available.  GL_QUERY_RESULT_AVAILABLE can be queried to
       determine if the result is immediately available or if the rendering is
       not yet complete.

NOTES
       If the query target's count exceeds the maximum value representable in
       the number of available bits, as reported by glGetQueryiv() with target
       set to the appropriate query target and pname GL_QUERY_COUNTER_BITS,
       the count becomes undefined.

       An implementation may support 0 bits in its counter, in which case
       query results are always undefined and essentially useless.

       When GL_SAMPLE_BUFFERS is 0, the samples-passed counter of an occlusion
       query will increment once for each fragment that passes the depth test.
       When GL_SAMPLE_BUFFERS is 1, an implementation may either increment the
       samples-passed counter individually for each sample of a fragment that
       passes the depth test, or it may choose to increment the counter for
       all samples of a fragment if any one of them passes the depth test.

       The query targets GL_ANY_SAMPLES_PASSED, and GL_TIME_ELAPSED are
       availale only if the GL version is 3.3 or higher.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if target is not one of the accepted
       tokens.


       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if glBeginQuery is executed while a
       query object of the same target is already active.


       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if glEndQuery() is executed when a
       query object of the same target is not active.


       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if id is 0.


       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if id is the name of an already
       active query object.


       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if id refers to an existing query
       object whose type does not does not match target.
