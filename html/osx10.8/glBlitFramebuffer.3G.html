NAME
       glBlitFramebuffer - copy a block of pixels from the read framebuffer to
       the draw framebuffer

C SPECIFICATION
       void glBlitFramebuffer(GLint srcX0, GLint srcY0, GLint srcX1,
			      GLint srcY1, GLint dstX0, GLint dstY0,
			      GLint dstX1, GLint dstY1, GLbitfield mask,
			      GLenum filter);

PARAMETERS
       srcX0, srcY0, srcX1, srcY1
	   Specify the bounds of the source rectangle within the read buffer
	   of the read framebuffer.

       dstX0, dstY0, dstX1, dstY1
	   Specify the bounds of the destination rectangle within the write
	   buffer of the write framebuffer.

       mask
	   The bitwise OR of the flags indicating which buffers are to be
	   copied. The allowed flags are GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT,
	   GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT and GL_STENCIL_BUFFER_BIT.

       filter
	   Specifies the interpolation to be applied if the image is
	   stretched. Must be GL_NEAREST or GL_LINEAR.

DESCRIPTION
       glBlitFramebuffer transfers a rectangle of pixel values from one region
       of the read framebuffer to another region in the draw framebuffer.
       mask is the bitwise OR of a number of values indicating which buffers
       are to be copied. The values are GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT,
       GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT, and GL_STENCIL_BUFFER_BIT. The pixels
       corresponding to these buffers are copied from the source rectangle
       bounded by the locations (srcX0; srcY0) and (srcX1; srcY1) to the
       destination rectangle bounded by the locations (dstX0; dstY0) and
       (dstX1; dstY1). The lower bounds of the rectangle are inclusive, while
       the upper bounds are exclusive.

       The actual region taken from the read framebuffer is limited to the
       intersection of the source buffers being transferred, which may include
       the color buffer selected by the read buffer, the depth buffer, and/or
       the stencil buffer depending on mask. The actual region written to the
       draw framebuffer is limited to the intersection of the destination
       buffers being written, which may include multiple draw buffers, the
       depth buffer, and/or the stencil buffer depending on mask. Whether or
       not the source or destination regions are altered due to these limits,
       the scaling and offset applied to pixels being transferred is performed
       as though no such limits were present.

       If the sizes of the source and destination rectangles are not equal,
       filter specifies the interpolation method that will be applied to
       resize the source image , and must be GL_NEAREST or GL_LINEAR.
       GL_LINEAR is only a valid interpolation method for the color buffer. If
       filter is not GL_NEAREST and mask includes GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT or
       GL_STENCIL_BUFFER_BIT, no data is transferred and a
       GL_INVALID_OPERATION error is generated.

       If filter is GL_LINEAR and the source rectangle would require sampling
       outside the bounds of the source framebuffer, values are read as if the
       GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE texture wrapping mode were applied.

       When the color buffer is transferred, values are taken from the read
       buffer of the read framebuffer and written to each of the draw buffers
       of the draw framebuffer.

       If the source and destination rectangles overlap or are the same, and
       the read and draw buffers are the same, the result of the operation is
       undefined.

NOTES
       glBindVertexArray is available only if the GL version is 3.0 or
       greater.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if mask contains any of the
       GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT or GL_STENCIL_BUFFER_BIT and filter is not
       GL_NEAREST.


       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if mask contains GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT
       and any of the following conditions hold:

       o   The read buffer contains fixed-point or floating-point values and
	   any draw buffer contains neither fixed-point nor floating-point
	   values.

       o   The read buffer contains unsigned integer values and any draw
	   buffer does not contain unsigned integer values.

       o   The read buffer contains signed integer values and any draw buffer
	   does not contain signed integer values.


       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if mask contains GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT
       or GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT and the source and destination depth and stencil
       formats do not match.


       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if filter is GL_LINEAR and the read
       buffer contains integer data.


       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if the value of GL_SAMPLES for the
       read and draw buffers is not identical.


       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if GL_SAMPLE_BUFFERS for both read
       and draw buffers greater than zero and the dimensions of the source and
       destination rectangles is not identical.


       GL_INVALID_FRAMEBUFFER_OPERATION is generated if the objects bound to
       GL_DRAW_FRAMEBUFFER_BINDING or GL_READ_FRAMEBUFFER_BINDING are not
       framebuffer complete.
