NAME
       MIME::Decoder::Binary - perform no encoding/decoding

SYNOPSIS
       A generic decoder object; see MIME::Decoder for usage.

DESCRIPTION
       A MIME::Decoder subclass for the "binary" encoding (in other words, no
       encoding).

       The "binary" decoder is a special case, since it's ill-advised to read
       the input line-by-line: after all, an uncompressed image file might
       conceivably have loooooooooong stretches of bytes without a "\n" among
       them, and we don't want to risk blowing out our core.  So, we read-and-
       write fixed-size chunks.

       Both the encoder and decoder do a simple pass-through of the data from
       input to output.
