NAME
       DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::NoBindVars - Sometime DBDs have poor to no
       support for bind variables

DESCRIPTION
       This class allows queries to work when the DBD or underlying library
       does not support the usual "?" placeholders, or at least doesn't
       support them very well, as is the case with DBD::Sybase

METHODS
   connect_info
       We can't cache very effectively without bind variables, so force the
       "disable_sth_caching" setting to be turned on when the connect info is
       set.

   _prep_for_execute
       Manually subs in the values for the usual "?" placeholders.

   interpolate_unquoted
       This method is called by "_prep_for_execute" for every column in order
       to determine if its value should be quoted or not. The arguments are
       the current column data type and the actual bind value. The return
       value is interpreted as: true - do not quote, false - do quote. You
       should override this in you Storage::DBI::&ltdatabase&gt subclass, if your
       RDBMS does not like quotes around certain datatypes (e.g. Sybase and
       integer columns). The default method returns false, except for integer
       datatypes paired with values containing nothing but digits.

	WARNING!!!

	Always validate that the bind-value is valid for the current datatype.
	Otherwise you may very well open the door to SQL injection attacks.

   _prep_interpolated_value
       Given a datatype and the value to be inserted directly into a SQL
       query, returns the necessary string to represent that value (by e.g.
       adding a '$' sign)
