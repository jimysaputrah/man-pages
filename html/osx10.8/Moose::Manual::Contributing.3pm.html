NAME
       Moose::Manual::Contributing - How to get involved in Moose

VERSION
       version 2.0205

GETTING INVOLVED
       Moose is an open project, and we are always willing to accept bug
       fixes, more tests, and documentation patches. Commit bits are given out
       freely, and the "STANDARD WORKFLOW" is very simple. The general gist
       is: clone the Git repository, create a new topic branch, hack away,
       then find a committer to review your changes.

NEW FEATURES
       Moose already has a fairly large feature set, and we are currently not
       looking to add any major new features to it. If you have an idea for a
       new feature in Moose, you are encouraged to create a MooseX module
       first.

       At this stage, no new features will even be considered for addition
       into the core without first being vetted as a MooseX module, unless it
       is absolutely 100% impossible to implement the feature outside the
       core.

       If you think it is 100% impossible, please come discuss it with us on
       IRC or via e-mail. Your feature may need a small hook in the core, or a
       refactoring of some core modules, and we are definitely open to that.

       Moose was built from the ground up with the idea of being highly
       extensible, and quite often the feature requests we see can be
       implemented through small extensions. Try it, it's much easier than you
       might think.

PEOPLE
       As Moose has matured, some structure has emerged in the process.

       Contributors - people creating a topic or branch
	   You.

	   If you have commit access, you can create a topic on the main
	   Moose.git repository.  If you don't have a commit bit, give us your
	   SSH key or create your own clone of the
	   <git://git.moose.perl.org/Moose.git> repository.

	   The relevant repository URIs are:

	   Read-Only
	       <git://git.moose.perl.org/Moose.git>

	   Read+Write
	       gitmo@git.moose.perl.org:Moose.git

       Cabal - people who can release moose
	   These people are the ones who have co-maint on Moose itself and can
	   create a release. They're listed under "CABAL" in Moose in the
	   Moose documentation. They are responsible for reviewing branches,
	   and are the only people who are allowed to push to stable branches.

	   Cabal members are listed in Moose and can often be found on irc in
	   the irc://irc.perl.org/#moose-dev <irc://irc.perl.org/#moose-dev>
	   channel.

BRANCH LAYOUT
       The repository is divided into several branches to make maintenance
       easier for everyone involved. The branches below are ordered by level
       of stability.

       stable/*
	   The branch from which releases are cut. When making a new major
	   release, the release manager makes a new "stable/X.YY" branch at
	   the current position of "master". The version used in the stable
	   branch should not include the last two digits of the version
	   number.

	   For minor releases, patches will be committed to "master", and
	   backported (cherry-picked) to the appropriate stable branch as
	   needed. A stable branch is only updated by someone from the Cabal
	   during a release.

       master
	   The main development branch. All new code should be written against
	   this branch. This branch contains code that has been reviewed, and
	   will be included in the next major release. Commits which are
	   judged to not break backwards compatibility may be backported into
	   "stable" to be included in the next minor release.

       rfc/*
	   Topic branches that are completed and waiting on review. A Cabal
	   member will look over branches in this namespace, and either merge
	   them to "master" if they are acceptable, or move them back to a
	   different namespace otherwise.

       topic/*
	   Small personal branches that are still in progress. They can be
	   freely rebased.  They contain targeted features that may span a
	   handful of commits. Any change or bugfix should be created in a
	   topic branch.

       attic/*
	   Branches which have been reviewed, and rejected. They remain in the
	   repository in case we later change our mind, or in case parts of
	   them are still useful.

       abandoned/*
	   Topic branches which have had no activity for a long period of time
	   will be moved here, to keep the main areas clean.

       Larger, longer term branches can also be created in the root namespace
       (i.e.  at the same level as master and stable). This may be appropriate
       if multiple people are intending to work on the branch. These branches
       should not be rebased without checking with other developers first.

STANDARD WORKFLOW
	   # update your copy of master
	   git checkout master
	   git pull --rebase

	   # create a new topic branch
	   git checkout -b topic/my-feature

	   # hack, commit, feel free to break fast forward
	   git commit --amend	     # allowed
	   git rebase --interactive  # allowed
	   git push --force	     # allowed

	   # keep the branch rebased on top of master, for easy reviewing
	   git remote update
	   git rebase origin/master
	   git push --force

	   # when finished, move the branch to the rfc/ namespace
	   git branch -m rfc/my-feature
	   git push
	   git push origin :topic/my-feature

       When your branch is completed, make sure it has been moved to the
       "rfc/" namespace and is rebased on top of master, and ask for
       review/approval (see "APPROVAL WORKFLOW"). If it is approved, the
       reviewer will merge it into "master".

       No actual merging (as in a human resolving conflicts) should be done
       when merging into "master", only from "master" into other branches.

APPROVAL WORKFLOW
       Moose is an open project but it is also an increasingly important one.
       Many modules depend on Moose being stable. Therefore, we have a basic
       set of criteria for reviewing and merging branches. What follows is a
       set of rough guidelines that ensures all new code is properly vetted
       before it is merged to the master branch.

       It should be noted that if you want your specific branch to be
       approved, it is your responsibility to follow this process and advocate
       for your branch. The preferred way is to send a request to the mailing
       list for review/approval; this allows us to better keep track of the
       branches awaiting approval and those which have been approved.

       Small bug fixes, doc patches and additional passing tests.
	   These items don't really require approval beyond one of the core
	   contributors just doing a simple review. For especially simple
	   patches (doc patches especially), committing directly to master is
	   fine.

       Larger bug fixes, doc additions and TODO or failing tests.
	   Larger bug fixes should be reviewed by at least one cabal member
	   and should be tested using the xt/author/test-my-dependents.t test.

	   New documentation is always welcome, but should also be reviewed by
	   a cabal member for accuracy.

	   TODO tests are basically feature requests, see our "NEW FEATURES"
	   section for more information on that. If your feature needs core
	   support, create a "topic/" branch using the "STANDARD WORKFLOW" and
	   start hacking away.

	   Failing tests are basically bug reports. You should find a core
	   contributor and/or cabal member to see if it is a real bug, then
	   submit the bug and your test to the RT queue. Source control is not
	   a bug reporting tool.

       New user-facing features.
	   Anything that creates a new user-visible feature needs to be
	   approved by more than one cabal member.

	   Make sure you have reviewed "NEW FEATURES" to be sure that you are
	   following the guidelines. Do not be surprised if a new feature is
	   rejected for the core.

       New internals features.
	   New features for Moose internals are less restrictive than user
	   facing features, but still require approval by at least one cabal
	   member.

	   Ideally you will have run the test-my-dependents.t script to be
	   sure you are not breaking any MooseX module or causing any other
	   unforeseen havoc. If you do this (rather than make us do it), it
	   will only help to hasten your branch's approval.

       Backwards incompatible changes.
	   Anything that breaks backwards compatibility must be discussed by
	   the cabal. Backwards incompatible changes should not be merged to
	   master if there are strong objections from any cabal members.

	   We have a policy for what we see as sane "BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY"
	   for Moose. If your changes break back-compat, you must be ready to
	   discuss and defend your change.

RELEASE WORKFLOW
	   # major releases (including trial releases)
	   git checkout master

	   # minor releases
	   git checkout stable/X.YY

	   # do final changelogging, etc
	   vim dist.ini # increment version number
	   git commit
	   dzil release # or dzil release --trial for trial releases
	   git commit # to add the actual release date
	   git branch stable/X.YY # only for non-trial major releases

   Release How-To
       Moose uses Dist::Zilla to manage releases. Although the git repository
       comes with a "Makefile.PL", it is a very basic one just to allow the
       basic "perl Makefile.PL && make && make test" cycle to work. In
       particular, it doesn't include any release metadata, such as
       dependencies. In order to get started with Dist::Zilla, first install
       it: "cpanm Dist::Zilla", and then install the plugins necessary for
       reading the "dist.ini": "dzil authordeps | cpanm".

       Moose releases fall into two categories, each with their own level of
       release preparation. A minor release is one which does not include any
       API changes, deprecations, and so on. In that case, it is sufficient to
       simply test the release candidate against a few different different
       Perls. Testing should be done against at least two recent major version
       of Perl (5.8.8 and 5.10.1, for example). If you have more versions
       available, you are encouraged to test them all. However, we do not put
       a lot of effort into supporting older 5.8.x releases.

       For major releases which include an API change or deprecation, you
       should run the xt/author/test-my-dependents.t test. This tests a long
       list of MooseX and other Moose-using modules from CPAN. In order to run
       this script, you must arrange to have the new version of Moose in
       Perl's include path. You can use "prove -b" and "prove -I", install the
       module, or fiddle with the "PERL5LIB" environment variable, whatever
       makes you happy.

       This test downloads each module from CPAN, runs its tests, and logs
       failures and warnings to a set of files named test-mydeps-$$-*.log. If
       there are failures or warnings, please work with the authors of the
       modules in question to fix them. If the module author simply isn't
       available or does not want to fix the bug, it is okay to make a
       release.

       Regardless of whether or not a new module is available, any breakages
       should be noted in the conflicts list in the distribution's dist.ini.

EMERGENCY BUG WORKFLOW (for immediate release)
       The stable branch exists for easily making bug fix releases.

	   git remote update
	   git checkout -b topic/my-emergency-fix origin/master
	   # hack
	   git commit

       Then a cabal member merges into "master", and backports the change into
       "stable/X.YY":

	   git checkout master
	   git merge topic/my-emergency-fix
	   git push
	   git checkout stable/X.YY
	   git cherry-pick -x master
	   git push
	   # release

PROJECT WORKFLOW
       For longer lasting branches, we use a subversion style branch layout,
       where master is routinely merged into the branch. Rebasing is allowed
       as long as all the branch contributors are using "git pull --rebase"
       properly.

       "commit --amend", "rebase --interactive", etc. are not allowed, and
       should only be done in topic branches. Committing to master is still
       done with the same review process as a topic branch, and the branch
       must merge as a fast forward.

       This is pretty much the way we're doing branches for large-ish things
       right now.

       Obviously there is no technical limitation on the number of branches.
       You can freely create topic branches off of project branches, or sub
       projects inside larger projects freely. Such branches should
       incorporate the name of the branch they were made off so that people
       don't accidentally assume they should be merged into master:

	   git checkout -b my-project--topic/foo my-project

       (unfortunately Git will not allow "my-project/foo" as a branch name if
       "my-project" is a valid ref).

BRANCH ARCHIVAL
       Merged branches should be deleted.

       Failed branches may be kept, but should be moved to "attic/" to
       differentiate them from in-progress topic branches.

       Branches that have not been worked on for a long time will be moved to
       "abandoned/" periodically, but feel free to move the branch back to
       "topic/" if you want to start working on it again.

TESTS, TESTS, TESTS
       If you write any code for Moose, you must add tests for that code. If
       you do not write tests then we cannot guarantee your change will not be
       removed or altered at a later date, as there is nothing to confirm this
       is desired behavior.

       If your code change/addition is deep within the bowels of Moose and
       your test exercises this feature in a non-obvious way, please add some
       comments either near the code in question or in the test so that others
       know.

       We also greatly appreciate documentation to go with your changes, and
       an entry in the Changes file. Make sure to give yourself credit! Major
       changes or new user-facing features should also be documented in
       Moose::Manual::Delta.

DOCS, DOCS, DOCS
       Any user-facing changes must be accompanied by documentation. If you're
       not comfortable writing docs yourself, you might be able to convince
       another Moose dev to help you.

       Our goal is to make sure that all features are documented. Undocumented
       features are not considered part of the API when it comes to
       determining whether a change is backwards compatible.

BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY
       Change is inevitable, and Moose is not immune to this. We do our best
       to maintain backwards compatibility, but we do not want the code base
       to become overburdened by this. This is not to say that we will be
       frivolous with our changes, quite the opposite, just that we are not
       afraid of change and will do our best to keep it as painless as
       possible for the end user.

       Our policy for handling backwards compatibility is documented in more
       detail in Moose::Manual::Support.

       All backwards incompatible changes must be documented in
       Moose::Manual::Delta. Make sure to document any useful tips or
       workarounds for the change in that document.
