NAME
       glGetBufferSubData - returns a subset of a buffer object's data store

C SPECIFICATION
       void glGetBufferSubData(GLenum target, GLintptr offset,
			       GLsizeiptr size, GLvoid * data);

PARAMETERS
       target
	   Specifies the target buffer object. The symbolic constant must be
	   GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, GL_COPY_READ_BUFFER, GL_COPY_WRITE_BUFFER,
	   GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, GL_PIXEL_PACK_BUFFER,
	   GL_PIXEL_UNPACK_BUFFER, GL_TEXTURE_BUFFER,
	   GL_TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_BUFFER, or GL_UNIFORM_BUFFER.

       offset
	   Specifies the offset into the buffer object's data store from which
	   data will be returned, measured in bytes.

       size
	   Specifies the size in bytes of the data store region being
	   returned.

       data
	   Specifies a pointer to the location where buffer object data is
	   returned.

DESCRIPTION
       glGetBufferSubData returns some or all of the data from the buffer
       object currently bound to target. Data starting at byte offset offset
       and extending for size bytes is copied from the data store to the
       memory pointed to by data. An error is thrown if the buffer object is
       currently mapped, or if offset and size together define a range beyond
       the bounds of the buffer object's data store.

NOTES
       If an error is generated, no change is made to the contents of data.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if target is not GL_ARRAY_BUFFER,
       GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, GL_PIXEL_PACK_BUFFER, or
       GL_PIXEL_UNPACK_BUFFER.


       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if offset or size is negative, or if
       together they define a region of memory that extends beyond the buffer
       object's allocated data store.


       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if the reserved buffer object name 0
       is bound to target.


       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if the buffer object being queried is
       mapped.
