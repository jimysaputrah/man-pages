NAME
       DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::Sybase::ASE::NoBindVars - Storage::DBI
       subclass for Sybase ASE without placeholder support

DESCRIPTION
       If you're using this driver then your version of Sybase or the
       libraries you use to connect to it do not support placeholders.

       You can also enable this driver explicitly using:

	 my $schema = SchemaClass->clone;
	 $schema->storage_type('::DBI::Sybase::ASE::NoBindVars');
	 $schema->connect($dsn, $user, $pass, \%opts);

       See the discussion in "Using ? Placeholders & bind parameters to
       $sth->execute" in DBD::Sybase for details on the pros and cons of using
       placeholders.

       One advantage of not using placeholders is that "select @@identity"
       will work for obtaining the last insert id of an "IDENTITY" column,
       instead of having to do "select max(col)" in a transaction as the base
       Sybase driver does.

       When using this driver, bind variables will be interpolated (properly
       quoted of course) into the SQL query itself, without using
       placeholders.

       The caching of prepared statements is also explicitly disabled, as the
       interpolation renders it useless.
