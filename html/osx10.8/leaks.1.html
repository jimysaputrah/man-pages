NAME
     leaks -- Search a process's memory for unreferenced malloc buffers

SYNOPSIS
     leaks [-nocontext] [-nostacks] [-exclude symbol] pid |
	   partial-executable-name

DESCRIPTION
     leaks identifies leaked memory -- memory that the application has allo-
     cated, but has been lost and cannot be freed.  Specifically, leaks exam-
     ines a specified process's memory for values that may be pointers to mal-
     loc-allocated buffers.  Any buffer reachable from a pointer in writable
     memory, a register, or on the stack is assumed to be memory in use.  Any
     buffer reachable from a pointer in a reachable malloc-allocated buffer is
     also assumed to be in use.  The buffers which are not reachable are
     leaks; the buffers could never be freed because no pointer exists in mem-
     ory to the buffer, and thus free() could never be called for these
     buffers.  Such buffers waste memory; removing them can reduce swapping
     and memory usage.	Leaks are particularly dangerous for long-running pro-
     grams, for eventually the leaks could fill memory and cause the applica-
     tion to crash.

     leaks requires one parameter -- either the process ID or executable name
     of the process to examine.  It also takes several arguments for modifying
     its behavior.

     For each leaked buffer that is found, leaks prints the address of the
     leaked memory and its size.  If leaks can determine that the object is an
     instance of an Objective-C, CoreFoundation, or C++ class, or a CFType, it
     also specifies the name and type of the class, and the binary image that
     implements the class.  It then prints a string or hexadecimal representa-
     tion of the contents of the memory, unless the -nocontext option was
     specified.

     If the MallocStackLogging environment variable was set when the applica-
     tion was launched, leaks also prints a stack trace describing where the
     buffer was allocated.

OPTIONS
     -nocontext     Do not print the string or hex representation of leaked
		    memory.  Although that information can be useful for rec-
		    ognizing the contents of the buffer and understanding why
		    it might be leaked, it can also provide overwhelming
		    detail, and could expose confidential information from
		    your process if you, for example, file bug reports with
		    that output included.

     -nostacks	    Do not print backtraces of leaked blocks even if the tar-
		    get process has the MallocStackLogging environment vari-
		    able set.

     -exclude symbol
		    Exclude leaked blocks whose backtraces include the speci-
		    fied symbol.  This option can be repeated for multiple
		    symbols.  This allows ignoring leaks that, for example,
		    are allocated in libraries for which you do not have
		    source code.

     The developer tools for the system also include a graphical application,
     /Developer/Applications/Instruments.app, that provides instruments that
     give information similar to that provided by leaks. The Leaks instrument
     performs memory leak analysis.  The Allocations instrument graphically
     displays dynamic, real-time information about the object and memory use
     in an application, including backtraces of where the allocations occured.
     To use these instruments, the target application must be launched from
     Instruments.app, whereas leaks can examine existing processes.
