NAME
       glVertexPointer - define an array of vertex data


C SPECIFICATION
       void glVertexPointer( GLint size,
			     GLenum type,
			     GLsizei stride,
			     const GLvoid *pointer )


PARAMETERS
       size	Specifies  the number of coordinates per vertex; must be 2, 3,
		or 4. The initial value is 4.

       type	Specifies the data type of each coordinate in the array.  Sym-
		bolic  constants GL_SHORT, GL_INT, GL_FLOAT, and GL_DOUBLE are
		accepted. The initial value is GL_FLOAT.

       stride	Specifies the byte offset  between  consecutive  vertices.  If
		stride	is 0, the vertices are understood to be tightly packed
		in the array. The initial value is 0.

       pointer	Specifies a pointer to the first coordinate of the first  ver-
		tex in the array. The initial value is 0.

DESCRIPTION
       glVertexPointer	specifies the location and data  of an array of vertex
       coordinates to use when rendering.  size specifies the number of  coor-
       dinates	per  vertex  and type the data type of the coordinates. stride
       specifies the byte stride from one vertex to the next allowing vertices
       and  attributes	to be packed into a single array or stored in separate
       arrays.	(Single-array storage may be more efficient on some  implemen-
       tations;  see  glInterleavedArrays.)  When a vertex array is specified,
       size, type, stride, and pointer are saved as client-side state.

       To enable and disable the vertex array, call glEnableClientState and
       glDisableClientState with the argument GL_VERTEX_ARRAY. If enabled, the
       vertex	array	is   used   when   glDrawArrays,   glDrawElements,  or
       glArrayElement is called.

       Use glDrawArrays to construct a sequence of primitives (all of the same
       type)  from  prespecified  vertex  and  vertex  attribute  arrays.  Use
       glArrayElement to specify primitives by indexing  vertices  and	vertex
       attributes  and glDrawElements to construct a sequence of primitives by
       indexing vertices and vertex attributes.

NOTES
       glVertexPointer is available only if the GL version is 1.1 or  greater.

       The  vertex  array  is  initially  disabled  and  isn't	accessed  when
       glArrayElement, glDrawElements or glDrawArrays is called.

       Execution of glVertexPointer is not allowed between  the  execution  of
       glBegin	and  the corresponding execution of glEnd, but an error may or
       may not be generated. If no error is generated, the operation is  unde-
       fined.

       glVertexPointer is typically implemented on the client side.

       Vertex  array  parameters  are  client-side state and are therefore not
       saved   or   restored   by   glPushAttrib   and	  glPopAttrib.	   Use
       glPushClientAttrib and glPopClientAttrib instead.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if size is not 2, 3, or 4.

       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if type is is not an accepted value.

       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if stride is negative.
