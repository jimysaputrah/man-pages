NAME
       pt::peg::from::peg - PEG Conversion. Read PEG format

SYNOPSIS
       package require Tcl  8.5

       package require pt::peg::from::peg  ?1?

       pt::peg::from::peg convert text

_________________________________________________________________

DESCRIPTION
       Are  you  lost ?  Do you have trouble understanding this document ?  In
       that case please read the overview  provided  by  the  Introduction  to
       Parser  Tools.  This document is the entrypoint to the whole system the
       current package is a part of.

       This package implements	the  converter	from  PEG  markup  to  parsing
       expression grammars.

       It resides in the Import section of the Core Layer of Parser Tools, and
       can be used either directly with the other packages of this  layer,  or
       indirectly  through the import manager provided by pt::peg::import. The
       latter is intented for use in untrusted environments and  done  through
       the  corresponding  import  plugin pt::peg::import::peg sitting between
       converter and import manager.

API
       The API provided by this package satisfies  the	specification  of  the
       Converter API found in the Parser Tools Import API specification.

       pt::peg::from::peg convert text
	      This  command takes the PEG markup encoding a parsing expression
	      grammar and contained in text, and generates the canonical seri-
	      alization  of  said grammar, as specified in section PEG serial-
	      ization format.  The created  value  is  then  returned  as  the
	      result of the command.


PEG SPECIFICATION LANGUAGE
       peg, a language for the specification of parsing expression grammars is
       meant to be human readable, and writable as well, yet strict enough  to
       allow  its  processing  by  machine. Like any computer language. It was
       defined to make writing the specification of a grammar easy,  something
       the other formats found in the Parser Tools do not lend themselves too.

       It is formally specified by the grammar shown below, written in itself.
       For  a  tutorial  / introduction to the language please go and read the
       PEG Language Tutorial.

   EXAMPLE
       Our example specifies the grammar for a basic 4-operation calculator.


       PEG calculator (Expression)
	   Digit      &lt- '0'/'1'/'2'/'3'/'4'/'5'/'6'/'7'/'8'/'9'   ;
	   Sign       &lt- '-' / '+'			 ;
	   Number     &lt- Sign? Digit+			      ;
	   Expression &lt- '(' Expression ')' / (Factor (MulOp Factor)*)	;
	   MulOp      &lt- '*' / '/'			 ;
	   Factor     &lt- Term (AddOp Term)*		      ;
	   AddOp      &lt- '+'/'-'			 ;
	   Term       &lt- Number 		    ;
       END;


       Using higher-level features of the notation, i.e. the character classes
       (predefined and custom), this example can be rewritten as


       PEG calculator (Expression)
	   Sign       &lt- [-+]				 ;
	   Number     &lt- Sign? &ltddigit&gt+		 ;
	   Expression &lt- '(' Expression ')' / (Factor (MulOp Factor)*)	;
	   MulOp      &lt- [*/]				 ;
	   Factor     &lt- Term (AddOp Term)*		      ;
	   AddOp      &lt- [-+]				 ;
	   Term       &lt- Number 		    ;
       END;



PEG SERIALIZATION FORMAT
       Here  we specify the format used by the Parser Tools to serialize Pars-
       ing Expression Grammars as immutable values for transport,  comparison,
       etc.

       We  distinguish	between regular and canonical serializations.  While a
       PEG may have more than one regular serialization only  exactly  one  of
       them will be canonical.

       regular serialization

	      [1]    The  serialization of any PEG is a nested Tcl dictionary.

	      [2]    This dictionary holds a single key, pt::grammar::peg, and
		     its  value. This value holds the contents of the grammar.

	      [3]    The contents of the grammar are a Tcl dictionary  holding
		     the  set  of nonterminal symbols and the starting expres-
		     sion. The relevant keys and their values are

		     rules  The value is a Tcl dictionary whose keys  are  the
			    names  of  the  nonterminal  symbols  known to the
			    grammar.

			    [1]    Each  nonterminal  symbol  may  occur  only
				   once.

			    [2]    The empty string is not a legal nonterminal
				   symbol.

			    [3]    The value for each symbol is a Tcl  dictio-
				   nary  itself.  The  relevant keys and their
				   values in this dictionary are

				   is	  The value is	the  serialization  of
					  the  parsing	expression  describing
					  the symbols sentennial structure, as
					  specified  in the section PE serial-
					  ization format.

				   mode   The value can be one of three values
					  specifying  how a parser should han-
					  dle the semantic value  produced  by
					  the symbol.

					  value  The  semantic	value  of  the
						 nonterminal  symbol   is   an
						 abstract syntax tree consist-
						 ing of a single node node for
						 the nonterminal itself, which
						 has the ASTs of the  symbol's
						 right	hand side as its chil-
						 dren.

					  leaf	 The  semantic	value  of  the
						 nonterminal   symbol	is  an
						 abstract syntax tree consist-
						 ing of a single node node for
						 the nonterminal, without  any
						 children.  Any ASTs generated
						 by the  symbol's  right  hand
						 side are discarded.

					  void	 The nonterminal has no seman-
						 tic value. Any ASTs generated
						 by  the  symbol's  right hand
						 side are discarded (as well).

		     start  The  value is the serialization of the start pars-
			    ing expression of the grammar, as specified in the
			    section PE serialization format.

	      [4]    The terminal symbols of the grammar are specified implic-
		     itly as the set of all terminal symbols used in the start
		     expression and on the RHS of the grammar rules.

       canonical serialization
	      The canonical serialization of a grammar has the format as spec-
	      ified in the previous item, and then additionally satisfies  the
	      constraints  below,  which make it unique among all the possible
	      serializations of this grammar.

	      [1]    The keys found in all the	nested	Tcl  dictionaries  are
		     sorted  in  ascending  dictionary	order, as generated by
		     Tcl's builtin command lsort -increasing -dict.

	      [2]    The string representation of the value is	the  canonical
		     representation of a Tcl dictionary. I.e. it does not con-
		     tain superfluous whitespace.


   EXAMPLE
       Assuming the following PEG for simple mathematical expressions


       PEG calculator (Expression)
	   Digit      &lt- '0'/'1'/'2'/'3'/'4'/'5'/'6'/'7'/'8'/'9'   ;
	   Sign       &lt- '-' / '+'			 ;
	   Number     &lt- Sign? Digit+			      ;
	   Expression &lt- '(' Expression ')' / (Factor (MulOp Factor)*)	;
	   MulOp      &lt- '*' / '/'			 ;
	   Factor     &lt- Term (AddOp Term)*		      ;
	   AddOp      &lt- '+'/'-'			 ;
	   Term       &lt- Number 		    ;
       END;


       then its canonical serialization (except for whitespace) is


       pt::grammar::peg {
	   rules {
	    AddOp      {is {/ {t -} {t +}}								  mode value}
	    Digit      {is {/ {t 0} {t 1} {t 2} {t 3} {t 4} {t 5} {t 6} {t 7} {t 8} {t 9}}		  mode value}
	    Expression {is {/ {x {t (} {n Expression} {t )}} {x {n Factor} {* {x {n MulOp} {n Factor}}}}} mode value}
	    Factor     {is {x {n Term} {* {x {n AddOp} {n Term}}}}					  mode value}
	    MulOp      {is {/ {t *} {t /}}								  mode value}
	    Number     {is {x {? {n Sign}} {+ {n Digit}}}						  mode value}
	    Sign       {is {/ {t -} {t +}}								  mode value}
	    Term       {is  {n Number}									  mode value}
	   }
	   start {n Expression}
       }

	      Combined Parsing Expressions

		     [1]    For parsing expressions e1, e2, ... the result  of
			    [list  /  e1  e2  ... ] is a parsing expression as
			    well.  This is the ordered choice, aka prioritized
			    choice.

		     [2]    For  parsing expressions e1, e2, ... the result of
			    [list x e1 e2 ... ] is  a  parsing	expression  as
			    well.  This is the sequence.

		     [3]    For  a  parsing expression e the result of [list *
			    e] is a parsing expression as well.  This  is  the
			    kleene  closure,  describing  zero or more repeti-
			    tions.

		     [4]    For a parsing expression e the result of  [list  +
			    e]	is  a parsing expression as well.  This is the
			    positive kleene closure, describing  one  or  more
			    repetitions.

		     [5]    For  a  parsing expression e the result of [list &
			    e] is a parsing expression as well.  This  is  the
			    and lookahead predicate.

		     [6]    For  a  parsing expression e the result of [list !
			    e] is a parsing expression as well.  This  is  the
			    not lookahead predicate.

		     [7]    For  a  parsing expression e the result of [list ?
			    e] is a parsing expression as well.  This  is  the
			    optional input.

       Canonical serialization
	      The canonical serialization of a parsing expression has the for-
	      mat as specified in the previous	item,  and  then  additionally
	      satisfies  the constraints below, which make it unique among all
	      the possible serializations of this parsing expression.

	      [1]    The string representation of the value is	the  canonical
		     representation  of a pure Tcl list. I.e. it does not con-
		     tain superfluous whitespace.

	      [2]    Terminals are not encoded as ranges (where start and  end
		     of the range are identical).



   EXAMPLE
       Assuming  the  parsing  expression  shown on the right-hand side of the
       rule


	   Expression &lt- '(' Expression ')'
		       / Factor (MulOp Factor)*


       then its canonical serialization (except for whitespace) is


	   {/ {x {t (} {n Expression} {t )}} {x {n Factor} {* {x {n MulOp} {n Factor}}}}}
