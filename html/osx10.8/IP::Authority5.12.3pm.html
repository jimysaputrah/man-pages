IP::Authority(3)      User Contributed Perl Documentation     IP::Authority(3)



NAME
       IP::Authority - fast lookup of authority by IP address

SYNOPSIS
	 use IP::Authority;
	 my $reg = IP::Authority-&gtnew();
	 print $reg-&gtinet_atoauth('212.67.197.128')   ."\n";
	 print $reg-&gtinet_atoauth('www.slashdot.org') ."\n";

DESCRIPTION
       Historically, the former InterNIC  managed (under the auspices of IANA)
       the allocation of IP numbers to ISPs and other organizations. This
       changed somewhat when the Regional Internet Registry system was
       started, with the creation of three (and later, four) Regional Internet
       Registries (RIRs) around the world, each managing the allocation of IP
       addresses to organizations within differing physical areas (see also
       RFC2050).

       This means that there is no central whois database for IP numbers.

       This module allows the user to lookup the RIR who has authority for a
       particular IP address. After finding out the authority for an IP
       address, it is possible to use the authority's whois server to lookup
       the netblock owner.

CONSTRUCTOR
       The constructor takes no arguments.

	 use IP::Authority;
	 my $reg = IP::Authority-&gtnew();

OBJECT METHODS
       All object methods are designed to be used in an object-oriented
       fashion.

	 $result = $object-&gtfoo_method($bar,$baz);

       Using the module in a procedural fashion (without the arrow syntax)
       won't work.

       $auth = $reg-&gtinet_atoauth(HOSTNAME)
	   Takes a string giving the name of a host, and translates that to an
	   two-letter string representing the regional Internet registry that
	   has authority of that IP address:

	     AR = ARIN (North America)
	     RI = RIPE (Europe)
	     LA = LACNIC (Latin America)
	     AP = APNIC (Asia-Pacific)
	     AF = AFRINIC (Africa and Indian Ocean)
	     IA = IANA (see RFC3330)

	   Takes arguments of both the 'rtfm.mit.edu' type and '18.181.0.24'.
	   If the host name cannot be resolved, returns undef. If the resolved
	   IP address is not contained within the database, returns undef. For
	   multi-homed hosts (hosts with more than one address), the first
	   address found is returned.

       $auth = $reg-&gtinet_ntoauth(IP_ADDRESS)
	   Takes a string (an opaque string as returned by
	   Socket::inet_aton()) and translates it into a two-letter string
	   representing the regional Internet registry that has authority of
	   that IP address:

	     AR = ARIN (North America)
	     RI = RIPE (Europe)
	     LA = LACNIC (Latin America)
	     AP = APNIC (Asia-Pacific)
	     AF = AFRINIC (Africa and Indian Ocean)
	     IA = IANA (see RFC3330)

	   If the IP address is not contained within the database, returns
	   undef.

       $t = $reg-&gtdb_time()
	   Returns the creation date of the database, measured as number of
	   seconds since the Unix epoch (00:00:00 GMT, January 1, 1970).
	   Suitable for feeding to "gmtime" and "localtime".

BUGS/LIMITATIONS
       Only works with IPv4 addresses and ASCII hostnames.
