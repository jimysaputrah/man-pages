NAME
       IO::Tty - Low-level allocate a pseudo-Tty, import constants.

VERSION
       1.08

SYNOPSIS
	   use IO::Tty qw(TIOCNOTTY);
	   ...
	   # use only to import constants, see IO::Pty to create ptys.

DESCRIPTION
       "IO::Tty" is used internally by "IO::Pty" to create a pseudo-tty.  You
       wouldn't want to use it directly except to import constants, use
       "IO::Pty".  For a list of importable constants, see IO::Tty::Constant.

       Windows is now supported, but ONLY under the Cygwin environment, see
       &lthttp://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/&gt.

       Please note that pty creation is very system-dependend.	From my
       experience, any modern POSIX system should be fine.  Find below a list
       of systems that "IO::Tty" should work on.  A more detailed table (which
       is slowly getting out-of-date) is available from the project pages
       document manager at SourceForge
       &lthttp://sourceforge.net/projects/expectperl/&gt.

       If you have problems on your system and your system is listed in the
       "verified" list, you probably have some non-standard setup, e.g. you
       compiled your Linux-kernel yourself and disabled ptys (bummer!).
       Please ask your friendly sysadmin for help.

       If your system is not listed, unpack the latest version of "IO::Tty",
       do a 'perl Makefile.PL; make; make test; uname -a' and send me
       (RGiersig@cpan.org) the results and I'll see what I can deduce from
       that.  There are chances that it will work right out-of-the-box...

       If it's working on your system, please send me a short note with
       details (version number, distribution, etc. 'uname -a' and 'perl -V' is
       a good start; also, the output from "perl Makefile.PL" contains a lot
       of interesting info, so please include that as well) so I can get an
       overview.  Thanks!

VERIFIED SYSTEMS, KNOWN ISSUES
       This is a list of systems that "IO::Tty" seems to work on ('make test'
       passes) with comments about "features":

       o   AIX 4.3

	   Returns EIO instead of EOF when the slave is closed.  Benign.

       o   AIX 5.x

       o   FreeBSD 4.4

	   EOF on the slave tty is not reported back to the master.

       o   OpenBSD 2.8

	   The ioctl TIOCSCTTY sometimes fails.  This is also known in
	   Tcl/Expect, see http://expect.nist.gov/FAQ.html

	   EOF on the slave tty is not reported back to the master.

       o   Darwin 7.9.0

       o   HPUX 10.20 & 11.00

	   EOF on the slave tty is not reported back to the master.

       o   IRIX 6.5

       o   Linux 2.2.x & 2.4.x

	   Returns EIO instead of EOF when the slave is closed.  Benign.

       o   OSF 4.0

	   EOF on the slave tty is not reported back to the master.

       o   Solaris 8, 2.7, 2.6

	   Has the "feature" of returning EOF just once?!

	   EOF on the slave tty is not reported back to the master.

       o   Windows NT/2k/XP (under Cygwin)

	   When you send (print) a too long line (&gt160 chars) to a non-raw
	   pty, the call just hangs forever and even alarm() cannot get you
	   out.  Don't complain to me...

	   EOF on the slave tty is not reported back to the master.

       o   z/OS

       The following systems have not been verified yet for this version, but
       a previous version worked on them:

       o   SCO Unix

       o   NetBSD

	   probably the same as the other *BSDs...
