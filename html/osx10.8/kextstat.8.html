KEXTSTAT(8)		  BSD System Manager's Manual		   KEXTSTAT(8)

NAME
     kextstat -- display status of loaded kernel extensions (kexts)

SYNOPSIS
     kextstat [-h] [-k] [-l] [-b identifier] ...

DESCRIPTION
     The kextstat utility displays the status of any kexts currently loaded in
     the kernel.  The following information is shown for each loaded kext:

     Index     The load index of the kext (used to track linkage references).
	       Gaps in the list indicate kexts that have been unloaded.

     Refs      The number of references to this kext by others.  If nonzero,
	       the kext cannot be unloaded.

     Address   The address in kernel space where the kext has been loaded.

     Size      The number of bytes of kernel memory that the kext occupies.
	       If this is zero, the kext is a built-in part of the kernel that
	       has a record as a kext for resolving dependencies among kexts.

     Wired     The number of wired bytes of kernel memory that the kext occu-
	       pies.

     Name      The CFBundleIdentifier of the kext.

     (Version)
	       The CFBundleVersion of the kext.

     <Linked Against>
	       The index numbers of all other kexts that this kext has a ref-
	       erence to.

OPTIONS
     These options are available:

     -b identifier, -bundle-id identifier
	       Display the status of only the kext with the given bundle iden-
	       tifier.	This option trumps the -no-kernel option; if both are
	       given and a kernel component is specified, its information is
	       shown.

     -h, -help
	       Print a help message describing each option flag and exit with
	       a success result, regardless of any other options on the com-
	       mand line.

     -k, -no-kernel
	       Don't show information for built-in components of the kernel.

     -l, -list-only
	       Print the list of loaded kexts only and omit the header (useful
	       for running output through text-analysis tools).

DIAGNOSTICS
     The kextstat utility exits with a status of 0 on success and with a
     nonzero status if an error occurs.
