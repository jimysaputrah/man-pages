NAME
       sasl_authorize_t - The SASL authorization callback



SYNOPSIS
       #include <sasl/sasl.h>


       int sasl_authorize_t(void *context,
			   const char *requested_user, unsigned alen,
			   const char *auth_identity, unsigned alen,
			   const char *def_realm, unsigned urlen,
			   struct propctx *propctx)


DESCRIPTION
       sasl_authorize_t   is   used  to  check	whether  the  authorized  user
       auth_identity may act as the user requested_user.  For example the user
       root  may wish to authenticate with his credentials but act as the user
       tmartin (with all of tmartin's rights not roots). A server  application
       should  be  very careful, and probably err on the side of caution, when
       determining which users may proxy as whom.



RETURN VALUE
       SASL callback functions should return SASL return codes. See sasl.h for
       a complete list. SASL_OK indicates success.
