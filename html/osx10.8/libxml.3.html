NAME
       libxml - library used to parse XML files

DESCRIPTION
       The  libxml  library is used to parse XML files.  Its internal document
       repesentation is as close as  possible  to  the	DOM  (Document	Object
       Model)  interface,  an  API  for accessing XML or HTML structured docu-
       ments.

       The libxml library also has a SAX-like interface, which is designed  to
       be  compatible  with expat(1).  NOTE: SAX, the Simple API for XML, is a
       standard interface for event-based XML  parsing,  developed  collabora-
       tively  by the members of the XML-DEV mailing list, currently hosted by
       OASIS.  The expat library is a XML 1.0 parser written in C, which  aims
       to  be  fully conforming.  It is currently not a validating XML proces-
       sor.

       The libxml library now includes a nearly complete XPath implementation.
       The  XPath (XML Path Language) is a language for addressing parts of an
       XML document, designed to be used by both XSLT and XPointer.

       The libxml library exports Push and Pull  type  parser  interfaces  for
       both XML and html.
