NAME
       HTML::HeadParser - Parse <HEAD> section of a HTML document

SYNOPSIS
	require HTML::HeadParser;
	$p = HTML::HeadParser->new;
	$p->parse($text) and  print "not finished";

	$p->header('Title')	     # to access <title>....</title>
	$p->header('Content-Base')   # to access <base href="http://...">
	$p->header('Foo')	     # to access <meta http-equiv="Foo" content="...">
	$p->header('X-Meta-Author')  # to access <meta name="author" content="...">
	$p->header('X-Meta-Charset') # to access <meta charset="...">

DESCRIPTION
       The "HTML::HeadParser" is a specialized (and lightweight)
       "HTML::Parser" that will only parse the <HEAD>...</HEAD> section of an
       HTML document.  The parse() method will return a FALSE value as soon as
       some <BODY> element or body text are found, and should not be called
       again after this.

       Note that the "HTML::HeadParser" might get confused if raw undecoded
       UTF-8 is passed to the parse() method.  Make sure the strings are
       properly decoded before passing them on.

       The "HTML::HeadParser" keeps a reference to a header object, and the
       parser will update this header object as the various elements of the
       <HEAD> section of the HTML document are recognized.  The following
       header fields are affected:

       Content-Base:
	   The Content-Base header is initialized from the <base href="...">
	   element.

       Title:
	   The Title header is initialized from the <title>...</title>
	   element.

       Isindex:
	   The Isindex header will be added if there is a <isindex> element in
	   the <head>.	The header value is initialized from the prompt
	   attribute if it is present.	If no prompt attribute is given it
	   will have '?' as the value.

       X-Meta-Foo:
	   All <meta> elements containing a "name" attribute will result in
	   headers using the prefix "X-Meta-" appended with the value of the
	   "name" attribute as the name of the header, and the value of the
	   "content" attribute as the pushed header value.

	   <meta> elements containing a "http-equiv" attribute will result in
	   headers as in above, but without the "X-Meta-" prefix in the header
	   name.

	   <meta> elements containing a "charset" attribute will result in an
	   "X-Meta-Charset" header, using the value of the "charset" attribute
	   as the pushed header value.

METHODS
       The following methods (in addition to those provided by the superclass)
       are available:

       $hp = HTML::HeadParser->new
       $hp = HTML::HeadParser->new( $header )
	   The object constructor.  The optional $header argument should be a
	   reference to an object that implement the header() and
	   push_header() methods as defined by the "HTTP::Headers" class.
	   Normally it will be of some class that is a or delegates to the
	   "HTTP::Headers" class.

	   If no $header is given "HTML::HeadParser" will create an
	   "HTTP::Headers" object by itself (initially empty).

       $hp->header;
	   Returns a reference to the header object.

       $hp->header( $key )
	   Returns a header value.  It is just a shorter way to write
	   "$hp->header->header($key)".

EXAMPLE
	$h = HTTP::Headers->new;
	$p = HTML::HeadParser->new($h);
	$p->parse(<<EOT);
	<title>Stupid example</title>
	<base href="http://www.linpro.no/lwp/">
	Normal text starts here.
	EOT
	undef $p;
	print $h->title;   # should print "Stupid example"

SEE ALSO
       HTML::Parser, HTTP::Headers

       The "HTTP::Headers" class is distributed as part of the libwww-perl
       package.  If you don't have that distribution installed you need to
       provide the $header argument to the "HTML::HeadParser" constructor with
       your own object that implements the documented protocol.
