NAME
       PPI::Statement::Package - A package statement

INHERITANCE
	 PPI::Statement::Package
	 isa PPI::Statement
	     isa PPI::Node
		 isa PPI::Element

DESCRIPTION
       Most PPI::Statement subclasses are assigned based on the value of the
       first token or word found in the statement. When PPI encounters a
       statement starting with 'package', it converts it to a
       "PPI::Statement::Package" object.

       When working with package statements, please remember that packages
       only exist within their scope, and proper support for scoping has yet
       to be completed in PPI.

       However, if the immediate parent of the package statement is the top
       level PPI::Document object, then it can be considered to define
       everything found until the next top-level "file scoped" package
       statement.

       A file may, however, contain nested temporary package, in which case
       you are mostly on your own :)

METHODS
       "PPI::Statement::Package" has a number of methods in addition to the
       standard PPI::Statement, PPI::Node and PPI::Element methods.

   namespace
       Most package declarations are simple, and just look something like

	 package Foo::Bar;

       The "namespace" method returns the name of the declared package, in the
       above case 'Foo::Bar'. It returns this exactly as written and does not
       attempt to clean up or resolve things like ::Foo to main::Foo.

       If the package statement is done any different way, it returns false.

   file_scoped
       Regardless of whether it is named or not, the "file_scoped" method will
       test to see if the package declaration is a top level "file scoped"
       statement or not, based on its location.

       In general, returns true if it is a "file scoped" package declaration
       with an immediate parent of the top level Document, or false if not.

       Note that if the PPI DOM tree does not have a PPI::Document object at
       as the root element, this will return false. Likewise, it will also
       return false if the root element is a PPI::Document::Fragment, as a
       fragment of a file does not represent a scope.
