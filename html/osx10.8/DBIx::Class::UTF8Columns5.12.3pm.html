NAME
       DBIx::Class::UTF8Columns - Force UTF8 (Unicode) flag on columns
       (DEPRECATED)

SYNOPSIS
	   package Artist;
	   use base 'DBIx::Class::Core';

	   __PACKAGE__->load_components(qw/UTF8Columns/);
	   __PACKAGE__->utf8_columns(qw/name description/);

	   # then belows return strings with utf8 flag
	   $artist->name;
	   $artist->get_column('description');

DESCRIPTION
       This module allows you to get and store utf8 (unicode) column data in a
       database that does not natively support unicode. It ensures that column
       data is correctly serialised as a byte stream when stored and de-
       serialised to unicode strings on retrieval.

	 THE USE OF THIS MODULE (AND ITS COUSIN DBIx::Class::ForceUTF8) IS VERY
	 STRONGLY DISCOURAGED, PLEASE READ THE WARNINGS BELOW FOR AN EXPLANATION.

       If you want to continue using this module and do not want to receive
       further warnings set the environment variable "DBIC_UTF8COLUMNS_OK" to
       a true value.

   Warning - Module does not function properly on create/insert
       Recently (April 2010) a bug was found deep in the core of DBIx::Class
       which affects any component attempting to perform encoding/decoding by
       overloading store_column and get_columns. As a result of this problem
       create sends the original column values to the database, while update
       sends the encoded values. DBIx::Class::UTF8Columns and
       DBIx::Class::ForceUTF8 are both affected by ths bug.

       It is unclear how this bug went undetected for so long (it was
       introduced in March 2006), No attempts to fix it will be made while the
       implications of changing such a fundamental behavior of DBIx::Class are
       being evaluated. However in this day and age you should not be using
       this module anyway as Unicode is properly supported by all major
       database engines, as explained below.

       If you have specific questions about the integrity of your data in
       light of this development - please join us on IRC or the mailing list
       to further discuss your concerns with the team.

   Warning - Native Database Unicode Support
       If your database natively supports Unicode (as does SQLite with the
       "sqlite_unicode" connect flag, MySQL with "mysql_enable_utf8" connect
       flag or Postgres with the "pg_enable_utf8" connect flag), then this
       component should not be used, and will corrupt unicode data in a subtle
       and unexpected manner.

       It is far better to do Unicode support within the database if possible
       rather than converting data to and from raw bytes on every database
       round trip.

   Warning - Component Overloading
       Note that this module overloads "store_column" in DBIx::Class::Row in a
       way that may prevent other components overloading the same method from
       working correctly. This component must be the last one before
       DBIx::Class::Row (which is provided by DBIx::Class::Core). DBIx::Class
       will detect such incorrect component order and issue an appropriate
       warning, advising which components need to be loaded differently.
