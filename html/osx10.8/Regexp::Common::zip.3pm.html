NAME
       Regexp::Common::zip -- provide regexes for postal codes.

SYNOPSIS
	   use Regexp::Common qw /zip/;

	   while (&lt&gt) {
	       /^$RE{zip}{Netherlands}$/   and	print "Dutch postal code\n";
	   }

DESCRIPTION
       Please consult the manual of Regexp::Common for a general description
       of the works of this interface.

       Do not use this module directly, but load it via Regexp::Common.

       This module offers patterns for zip or postal codes of many different
       countries. They all have the form "$RE{zip}{Country}[{options}]".

       The following common options are used:

   "{-prefix=[yes|no|allow]}" and "{-country=PAT}".
       Postal codes can be prefixed with a country abbreviation. That is, a
       dutch postal code of 1234 AB can also be written as NL-1234 AB.	By
       default, all the patterns will allow the prefixes. But this can be
       changed with the "-prefix" option. With "-prefix=yes", the returned
       pattern requires a country prefix, while "-prefix=no" disallows a
       prefix. Any argument that doesn't start with a "y" or a "n" allows a
       country prefix, but doesn't require them.

       The prefixes used are, unfortunally, not always the same. Officially,
       ISO country codes need to be used, but the usage of CEPT codes (the
       same ones as used on cars) is common too. By default, each postal code
       will recognize a country prefix that's either the ISO standard or the
       CEPT code. That is, German postal codes may prefixed with either "DE"
       or "D". The recognized prefix can be changed with the "-country"
       option, which takes a (sub)pattern as argument. The arguments "iso" and
       "cept" are special, and indicate the language prefix should be the ISO
       country code, or the CEPT code.

       Examples:
	/$RE{zip}{Netherlands}/;
		  # Matches '1234 AB' and 'NL-1234 AB'.
	/$RE{zip}{Netherlands}{-prefix =&gt 'no'}/;
		  # Matches '1234 AB' but not 'NL-1234 AB'.
	/$RE{zip}{Netherlands}{-prefix =&gt 'yes'}/;
		  # Matches 'NL-1234 AB' but not '1234 AB'.

	/$RE{zip}{Germany}/;
		  # Matches 'DE-12345' and 'D-12345'.
	/$RE{zip}{Germany}{-country =&gt 'iso'}/;
		  # Matches 'DE-12345' but not 'D-12345'.
	/$RE{zip}{Germany}{-country =&gt 'cept'}/;
		  # Matches 'D-12345' but not 'DE-12345'.
	/$RE{zip}{Germany}{-country =&gt 'GER'}/;
		  # Matches 'GER-12345'.

   "{-sep=PAT}"
       Some countries have postal codes that consist of two parts. Typically
       there is an official way of separating those parts; but in practise
       people tend to use different separators. For instance, if the official
       way to separate parts is to use a space, it happens that the space is
       left off. The "-sep" option can be given a pattern as argument which
       indicates what to use as a separator between the parts.

       Examples:
	/$RE{zip}{Netherlands}/;
		  # Matches '1234 AB' but not '1234AB'.
	/$RE{zip}{Netherlands}{-sep =&gt '\s*'}/;
		  # Matches '1234 AB' and '1234AB'.

   $RE{zip}{Australia}
       Returns a pattern that recognizes Australian postal codes. Australian
       postal codes consist of four digits; the first two digits, which range
       from '10' to '97', indicate the state. Territories use '02' or '08' as
       starting digits; the leading zero is optional. '0909' is the only
       postal code starting with '09' (the leading zero is optional here as
       well) - this is the postal code for the Nothern Territory University).
       The (optional) country prefixes are AU (ISO country code) and AUS (CEPT
       code).  Regexp::Common 2.107 and before used $RE{zip}{Australia}. This
       is still supported.

       If "{-keep}" is used, the following variables will be set:

       $1  The entire postal code.

       $2  The country code prefix.

       $3  The postal code without the country prefix.

       $4  The state or territory.

       codes consist of 5 digits. The first digit indicates the region, the
       second the province. The third digit is odd for province capitals, and
       even for the province itself. The fourth digit indicates the route, and
       the fifth a place on the route (0 for small places, alphabetically for
       the rest).

       separator can be changed using the "{-sep}" option, as discussed above.
       The (optional) country prefix is NL, which is both the ISO country code

       postal codes consist of four digits.

       The country prefix is either NO (the ISO country code), or N (the CEPT
       code).

       If "{-keep}" is used, the following variables will be set:

       $1  The entire postal code.

       $2  The country code prefix.

       fourth the post office number.

   $RE{zip}{US}{-extended =&gt [yes|no|allow]}
       Returns a pattern that recognizes US zip codes. US zip codes consist of
       5 digits, with an optional 4 digit extension. By default, extensions
       are allowed, but not required. This can be influenced by the
       "-extended" option. If its argument starts with a "y", extensions are
       required; if the argument starts with a "n", extensions will not be
       recognized. If an extension is used, a dash is used to separate the
       main part from the extension, but this can be changed with the "-sep"
       option.

       The country prefix is either US (the ISO country code), or USA (the
       CEPT code).

       If "{-keep}" is being used, the following variables will be set:

       $1  The entire postal code.

       $2  The country code prefix.

       $3  The postal code without the country prefix.

       $4  The first 5 digits of the postal code.

       $5  The first three digits of the postal code, indicating a sectional
	   center or a large city. New in Regexp::Common 2.119.

       $6  The last 2 digits of the 5 digit part of the postal code,
	   indicating a post office facility or delivery area. New in
	   Regexp::Common 2.119.

       $7  The separator between the 5 digit part and the 4 digit part. Up to
	   Regexp::Common 2.118, this used to be $5.

       $8  The 4 digit part of the postal code (if any). Up to Regexp::Common
	   2.118, this used to be $6.

       $9  The first two digits of the 4 digit part of the postal code,
	   indicating a sector, or several blocks. New in Regexp::Common
	   2.119.

       $10 The last two digits of the 4 digit part of the postal code,
	   indicating a segment or one side of a street. New in Regexp::Common
	   2.119.

       You need at least version 5.005_03 to be able to use US postal codes.
       Older versions contain a bug that let the pattern match invalid US
       postal codes.

       Questions

       o   Can the 5 digit part of the zip code (in theory) start with 000?

       o   Can the 5 digit part of the zip code (in theory) end with 00?

       o   Can the 4 digit part of the zip code (in theory) start with 00?

       o   Can the 4 digit part of the zip code (in theory) end with 00?
