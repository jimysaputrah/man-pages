Class::Accessor::GroupUser)Contributed Perl DocumenClass::Accessor::Grouped(3)



NAME
       Class::Accessor::Grouped - Lets you build groups of accessors

SYNOPSIS
	use base 'Class::Accessor::Grouped';

	# make basic accessors for objects
	__PACKAGE__-&gtmk_group_accessors(simple =&gt qw(id name email));

	# make accessor that works for objects and classes
	__PACKAGE__-&gtmk_group_accessors(inherited =&gt 'awesome_level');

DESCRIPTION
       This class lets you build groups of accessors that will call different
       getters and setters.

METHODS
   mk_group_accessors
	__PACKAGE__-&gtmk_group_accessors(simple =&gt 'hair_length');

       Arguments: $group, @fieldspec
	   Returns: none

       Creates a set of accessors in a given group.

       $group is the name of the accessor group for the generated accessors;
       they will call get_$group($field) on get and set_$group($field, $value)
       on set.

       If you want to mimic Class::Accessor's mk_accessors $group has to be
       'simple' to tell Class::Accessor::Grouped to use its own get_simple and
       set_simple methods.

       @fieldspec is a list of field/accessor names; if a fieldspec is a
       scalar this is used as both field and accessor name, if a listref it is
       expected to be of the form [ $accessor, $field ].

   mk_group_ro_accessors
	__PACKAGE__-&gtmk_group_ro_accessors(simple =&gt 'birthdate');

       Arguments: $group, @fieldspec
	   Returns: none

       Creates a set of read only accessors in a given group. Identical to
       "mk_group_accessors" but accessors will throw an error if passed a
       value rather than setting the value.

   mk_group_wo_accessors
	__PACKAGE__-&gtmk_group_wo_accessors(simple =&gt 'lie');

       Arguments: $group, @fieldspec
	   Returns: none

       Creates a set of write only accessors in a given group. Identical to
       "mk_group_accessors" but accessors will throw an error if not passed a
       value rather than getting the value.

   make_group_accessor
	__PACKAGE__-&gtmake_group_accessor(simple =&gt 'hair_length', 'hair_length');

       Arguments: $group, $field, $method
	   Returns: \&accessor_coderef ?

       Called by mk_group_accessors for each entry in @fieldspec. Either
       returns a coderef which will be installed at "&__PACKAGE__::$method",
       or returns "undef" if it elects to install the coderef on its own.

   make_group_ro_accessor
	__PACKAGE__-&gtmake_group_ro_accessor(simple =&gt 'birthdate', 'birthdate');

       Arguments: $group, $field, $method
	   Returns: \&accessor_coderef ?

       Called by mk_group_ro_accessors for each entry in @fieldspec. Either
       returns a coderef which will be installed at "&__PACKAGE__::$method",
       or returns "undef" if it elects to install the coderef on its own.

   make_group_wo_accessor
	__PACKAGE__-&gtmake_group_wo_accessor(simple =&gt 'lie', 'lie');

       Arguments: $group, $field, $method
	   Returns: \&accessor_coderef ?

       Called by mk_group_wo_accessors for each entry in @fieldspec. Either
       returns a coderef which will be installed at "&__PACKAGE__::$method",
       or returns "undef" if it elects to install the coderef on its own.

   get_simple
       Arguments: $field
	   Returns: $value

       Simple getter for hash-based objects which returns the value for the
       field name passed as an argument.

   set_simple
       Arguments: $field, $new_value
	   Returns: $new_value

       Simple setter for hash-based objects which sets and then returns the
       value for the field name passed as an argument.

   get_inherited
       Arguments: $field
	   Returns: $value

       Simple getter for Classes and hash-based objects which returns the
       value for the field name passed as an argument. This behaves much like
       Class::Data::Accessor where the field can be set in a base class,
       inherited and changed in subclasses, and inherited and changed for
       object instances.

   set_inherited
       Arguments: $field, $new_value
	   Returns: $new_value

       Simple setter for Classes and hash-based objects which sets and then
       returns the value for the field name passed as an argument. When called
       on a hash-based object it will set the appropriate hash key value. When
       called on a class, it will set a class level variable.

       Note:: This method will die if you try to set an object variable on a
       non hash-based object.

   get_component_class
       Arguments: $field
	   Returns: $value

       Gets the value of the specified component class.

	   __PACKAGE__-&gtmk_group_accessors('component_class' =&gt 'result_class');

	   $self-&gtresult_class-&gtmethod();

	   ## same as
	   $self-&gtget_component_class('result_class')-&gtmethod();

   set_component_class
       Arguments: $field, $class
	   Returns: $new_value

       Inherited accessor that automatically loads the specified class before
       setting it. This method will die if the specified class could not be
       loaded.

	   __PACKAGE__-&gtmk_group_accessors('component_class' =&gt 'result_class');
	   __PACKAGE__-&gtresult_class('MyClass');

	   $self-&gtresult_class-&gtmethod();

   get_super_paths
       Returns a list of 'parent' or 'super' class names that the current
       class inherited from.

PERFORMANCE
       To provide total flexibility Class::Accessor::Grouped calls methods
       internally while performing get/set actions, which makes it noticeably
       slower than similar modules. To compensate, this module will
       automatically use the insanely fast Class::XSAccessor to generate the
       "simple"-group accessors if this module is available on your system.

   Benchmark
       This is the result of a set/get/set loop benchmark on perl 5.12.1 with
       thread support, showcasing most popular accessor builders: Moose,
       Mouse, Moo, CAF, CAF_XS, XSA, and CAF_XSA:

   Notes on Class::XSAccessor
       You can force (or disable) the use of Class::XSAccessor before creating
       a particular "simple" accessor by either manipulating the global
       variable $Class::Accessor::Grouped::USE_XS to true or false (preferably
       with localization, or you can do so before runtime via the "CAG_USE_XS"
       environment variable.

       Since Class::XSAccessor has no knowledge of "get_simple" and
       "set_simple" this module does its best to detect if you are overriding
       one of these methods and will fall back to using the perl version of
       the accessor in order to maintain consistency. However be aware that if
       you enable use of "Class::XSAccessor" (automatically or explicitly),
       create an object, invoke a simple accessor on that object, and then
       manipulate the symbol table to install a "get/set_simple" override -
       you get to keep all the pieces.
