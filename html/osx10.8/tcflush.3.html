TCSENDBREAK(3)		 BSD Library Functions Manual		TCSENDBREAK(3)

NAME
     tcdrain, tcflow, tcflush, tcsendbreak -- line control functions

LIBRARY
     Standard C Library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
     #include &lttermios.h&gt

     int
     tcdrain(int fildes);

     int
     tcflow(int fildes, int action);

     int
     tcflush(int fildes, int action);

     int
     tcsendbreak(int fildes, int duration);

DESCRIPTION
     The tcdrain() function waits until all output written to the terminal
     referenced by fildes has been transmitted to the terminal.

     The tcflow() function suspends transmission of data to, or the reception
     of data from, the terminal referenced by fildes, depending on the value
     of action.  The value of action must be one of the following:

     TCOOFF  Suspend output.

     TCOON   Restart suspended output.

     TCIOFF  Transmit a STOP character, which is intended to cause the termi-
	     nal to stop transmitting data to the system.  (See the descrip-
	     tion of IXOFF in the `Input Modes' section of termios(4)).

     TCION   Transmit a START character, which is intended to cause the termi-
	     nal to start transmitting data to the system.  (See the descrip-
	     tion of IXOFF in the `Input Modes' section of termios(4)).

     The tcflush() function discards any data written to the terminal refer-
     enced by fildes which has not been transmitted to the terminal, or any
     data received from the terminal but not yet read, depending on the value
     of action.  The value of action must be one of the following:

     TCIFLUSH	Flush data received but not read.

     TCOFLUSH	Flush data written but not transmitted.

     TCIOFLUSH	Flush both data received but not read and data written but not
		transmitted.

     The tcsendbreak() function transmits a continuous stream of zero-valued
     bits for four-tenths of a second to the terminal referenced by fildes.
     The duration parameter is ignored in this implementation.

RETURN VALUES
     Upon successful completion, all of these functions return a value of
     zero.

ERRORS
     If any error occurs, a value of -1 is returned and the global variable
     errno is set to indicate the error, as follows:

     [EBADF]		The fildes argument is not a valid file descriptor.

     [EINTR]		A signal interrupted the tcdrain() function.

     [EINVAL]		The action argument is not a proper value.

     [ENOTTY]		The file associated with fildes is not a terminal.

STANDARDS
     The tcsendbreak(), tcdrain(), tcflush() and tcflow() functions are
     expected to be compliant with the IEEE Std 1003.1-1988 (``POSIX.1'')
     specification.
