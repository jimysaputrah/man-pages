DESCRIPTION
       Please read Name service facility, introduction first.

       This  package  is internal and of no interest to users. It provides the
       commands of the name service facility which are shared  by  the	client
       and  server  implemented  by the packages nameserv::server and nameserv
       (the client).

       This service is built in top of and for the package comm.  It has noth-
       ing  to	do  with  the  Internet's Domain Name System. If the reader is
       looking for a package dealing with that please  see  Tcllib's  packages
       dns and resolv.

API
       The package exports a single command, as specified below:

	      The  result  returned  by  the  command is the id of the default
	      TCP/IP port a nameservice server will listen on, and a name ser-
	      vice client will try to connect to.
