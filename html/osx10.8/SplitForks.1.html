NAME
     /usr/bin/SplitForks -- Divide a two-fork HFS file into AppleDouble format
     resource and data files.

SYNOPSIS
     /usr/bin/SplitForks [-s] [-v] file

DESCRIPTION
     SplitForks takes a Macintosh HFS or HFS Extended ("HFS+") two-fork file

     and the resource fork and file system metadata in another.

     /usr/bin/SplitForks takes the following flags and arguments:

     [s]      Strip the resource fork from the original file.  The default is
	      to leave the resource file in place after copying it to its
	      AppleDouble metadata file.

     [v]      Produce verbose diagnostics to standard output.

     file     The file to split.

FILES
     foo     Data fork of file 'foo'

NOTES
     SplitForks will fail with error 2 if the designated file is not on an HFS
     or Extended HFS file system volume.
