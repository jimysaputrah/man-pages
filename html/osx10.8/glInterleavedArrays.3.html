NAME
       glInterleavedArrays  - simultaneously specify and enable several inter-
       leaved arrays


C SPECIFICATION
       void glInterleavedArrays( GLenum format,
				 GLsizei stride,
				 const GLvoid *pointer )


PARAMETERS
       format	Specifies the type of  array  to  enable.  Symbolic  constants
		GL_V2F,    GL_V3F,   GL_C4UB_V2F,   GL_C4UB_V3F,   GL_C3F_V3F,
		GL_N3F_V3F,    GL_C4F_N3F_V3F,	   GL_T2F_V3F,	   GL_T4F_V4F,
		GL_T2F_C4UB_V3F,	GL_T2F_C3F_V3F,        GL_T2F_N3F_V3F,
		GL_T2F_C4F_N3F_V3F, and GL_T4F_C4F_N3F_V4F are accepted.

       stride	Specifies the offset in bytes  between	each  aggregate  array
		element.

DESCRIPTION
       glInterleavedArrays  lets you specify and enable individual color, nor-
       mal, texture and vertex arrays whose elements  are  part  of  a	larger
       aggregate  array element.  For some implementations, this is more effi-
       cient than specifying the arrays separately.

       If stride is 0, the aggregate elements are stored consecutively.   Oth-
       erwise, stride bytes occur between the beginning of one aggregate array
       element and the beginning of the next aggregate array element.

       format serves as a ``key''  describing  the  extraction	of  individual
       arrays  from the aggregate array.  If format contains a T, then texture
       coordinates are extracted from the interleaved array.  If C is present,
       color  values  are  extracted.  If N is present, normal coordinates are
       extracted.  Vertex coordinates are always extracted.

       The digits 2, 3, and 4 denote how many values are extracted.   F  indi-
       cates  that  values are extracted as floating-point values.  Colors may
       also be extracted as 4 unsigned bytes if 4UB follows the C.  If a color
       is  extracted  as 4 unsigned bytes, the vertex array element which fol-
       lows is located at the first possible floating-point aligned address.

NOTES
       glInterleavedArrays is available only if  the  GL  version  is  1.1  or
       greater.

       If  glInterleavedArrays is called while compiling a display list, it is
       not compiled into the list, and it is executed immediately.

       Execution of glInterleavedArrays is not allowed between	the  execution
       of  glBegin  and the corresponding execution of glEnd, but an error may
       or may not be generated. If no error is	generated,  the  operation  is
       undefined.

       glInterleavedArrays is typically implemented on the client side.

       Vertex  array  parameters  are  client-side state and are therefore not
       saved   or   restored   by   glPushAttrib   and	  glPopAttrib.	   Use
       glPushClientAttrib and glPopClientAttrib instead.

       When	the	GL_ARB_multitexture	extension     is    supported,
       glInterleavedArrays only updates the texture coordinate array  for  the
       active  active  texture	unit.  The  texture coordinate state for other
       client texture units is not update, regardless if they are  enabled  or
       not.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if format is not an accepted value.

       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if stride is negative.
