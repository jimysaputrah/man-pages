NAME
       File::DosGlob - DOS like globbing and then some

SYNOPSIS
	   require 5.004;

	   # override CORE::glob in current package
	   use File::DosGlob 'glob';

	   # override CORE::glob in ALL packages (use with extreme caution!)
	   use File::DosGlob 'GLOBAL_glob';

	   @perlfiles = glob  "..\\pe?l/*.p?";
	   print <..\\pe?l/*.p?>;

	   # from the command line (overrides only in main::)
	   > perl -MFile::DosGlob=glob -e "print <../pe*/*p?>"

DESCRIPTION
       A module that implements DOS-like globbing with a few enhancements.  It
       is largely compatible with perlglob.exe (the M$ setargv.obj version) in
       all but one respect--it understands wildcards in directory components.

       For example, "<..\\l*b\\file/*glob.p?"> will work as expected (in that
       it will find something like '..\lib\File/DosGlob.pm' alright).  Note
       that all path components are case-insensitive, and that backslashes and
       forward slashes are both accepted, and preserved.  You may have to
       double the backslashes if you are putting them in literally, due to
       double-quotish parsing of the pattern by perl.

       Spaces in the argument delimit distinct patterns, so "glob('*.exe
       *.dll')" globs all filenames that end in ".exe" or ".dll".  If you want
       to put in literal spaces in the glob pattern, you can escape them with
       either double quotes, or backslashes.  e.g. "glob('c:/"Program
       Files"/*/*.dll')", or "glob('c:/Program\ Files/*/*.dll')".  The
       argument is tokenized using "Text::ParseWords::parse_line()", so see
       Text::ParseWords for details of the quoting rules used.

       Extending it to csh patterns is left as an exercise to the reader.

NOTES
       o   Mac OS (Classic) users should note a few differences. The
	   specification of pathnames in glob patterns adheres to the usual
	   Mac OS conventions: The path separator is a colon ':', not a slash
	   '/' or backslash '\'. A full path always begins with a volume name.
	   A relative pathname on Mac OS must always begin with a ':', except
	   when specifying a file or directory name in the current working
	   directory, where the leading colon is optional. If specifying a
	   volume name only, a trailing ':' is required. Due to these rules, a
	   glob like <*:> will find all mounted volumes, while a glob like <*>
	   or <:*> will find all files and directories in the current
	   directory.

	   Note that updirs in the glob pattern are resolved before the
	   matching begins, i.e. a pattern like "*HD:t?p::a*" will be matched
	   as "*HD:a*". Note also, that a single trailing ':' in the pattern
	   is ignored (unless it's a volume name pattern like "*HD:"), i.e. a
	   glob like <:*:> will find both directories and files (and not, as
	   one might expect, only directories).

	   The metachars '*', '?' and the escape char '\' are valid characters
	   in volume, directory and file names on Mac OS. Hence, if you want
	   to match a '*', '?' or '\' literally, you have to escape these
	   characters. Due to perl's quoting rules, things may get a bit
	   complicated, when you want to match a string like '\*' literally,
	   or when you want to match '\' literally, but treat the immediately
	   following character '*' as metachar. So, here's a rule of thumb
	   (applies to both single- and double-quoted strings): escape each
	   '*' or '?' or '\' with a backslash, if you want to treat them
	   literally, and then double each backslash and your are done. E.g.

	   - Match '\*' literally

	      escape both '\' and '*'  : '\\\*'
	      double the backslashes   : '\\\\\\*'

	   (Internally, the glob routine sees a '\\\*', which means that both
	   '\' and '*' are escaped.)

	   - Match '\' literally, treat '*' as metachar

	      escape '\' but not '*'   : '\\*'
	      double the backslashes   : '\\\\*'

	   (Internally, the glob routine sees a '\\*', which means that '\' is
	   escaped and '*' is not.)

	   Note that you also have to quote literal spaces in the glob
	   pattern, as described above.

EXPORTS (by request only)
       glob()

BUGS
       Should probably be built into the core, and needs to stop pandering to
       DOS habits.  Needs a dose of optimizium too.

HISTORY
       o   Support for globally overriding glob() (GSAR 3-JUN-98)

       o   Scalar context, independent iterator context fixes (GSAR 15-SEP-97)

       o   A few dir-vs-file optimizations result in glob importation being 10
	   times faster than using perlglob.exe, and using perlglob.bat is
	   only twice as slow as perlglob.exe (GSAR 28-MAY-97)

       o   Several cleanups prompted by lack of compatible perlglob.exe under
	   Borland (GSAR 27-MAY-97)

       o   Initial version (GSAR 20-FEB-97)
