NAME
       glLogicOp - specify a logical pixel operation for color index rendering


C SPECIFICATION
       void glLogicOp( GLenum opcode )


PARAMETERS
       opcode  Specifies a symbolic constant that selects a logical operation.
	       The  following symbols are accepted: GL_CLEAR, GL_SET, GL_COPY,
	       GL_COPY_INVERTED, GL_NOOP, GL_INVERT, GL_AND,  GL_NAND,	GL_OR,
	       GL_NOR,	 GL_XOR,  GL_EQUIV,  GL_AND_REVERSE,  GL_AND_INVERTED,
	       GL_OR_REVERSE,  and  GL_OR_INVERTED.  The  initial   value   is
	       GL_COPY.

DESCRIPTION
       glLogicOp  specifies a logical operation that, when enabled, is applied
       between the incoming color index or RGBA color and the color  index  or
       RGBA  color  at	the  corresponding  location  in the frame buffer.  To
       enable or disable the logical operation, call  glEnable	and  glDisable
       using   the  symbolic  constant	GL_COLOR_LOGIC_OP  for	RGBA  mode  or
       GL_INDEX_LOGIC_OP for color index mode. The initial value  is  disabled
       for both operations.


	Opcode		   Resulting Operation
	GL_CLEAR	   0
	GL_SET		   1
	GL_COPY 	   s
	GL_COPY_INVERTED   ~s
	GL_NOOP 	   d
	GL_INVERT	   ~d
	GL_AND		   s & d
	GL_NAND 	   ~(s & d)
	GL_OR		   s | d
	GL_NOR		   ~(s | d)
	GL_XOR		   s ^ d
	GL_EQUIV	   ~(s ^ d)
	GL_AND_REVERSE	   s & ~d
	GL_AND_INVERTED    ~s & d
	GL_OR_REVERSE	   s | ~d
	GL_OR_INVERTED	   ~s | d

       opcode  is  a  symbolic	constant  chosen  from the list above.	In the
       explanation of the logical operations, s represents the incoming  color
       index  and d represents the index in the frame buffer.  Standard C-lan-
       guage operators are used.  As these bitwise operators suggest, the log-
       ical  operation is applied independently to each bit pair of the source
       and destination indices or colors.

NOTES
       Color index logical operations are always supported. RGBA logical oper-
       ations are supported only if the GL version is 1.1 or greater.

       When  more  than one RGBA color or index buffer is enabled for drawing,
       logical operations are performed separately for	each  enabled  buffer,
       using  for  the	destination  value  the  contents  of that buffer (see
       glDrawBuffer).

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if opcode is not an accepted value.

       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if glLogicOp is executed between  the
       execution of glBegin and the corresponding execution of glEnd.

ASSOCIATED GETS
       glGet with argument GL_LOGIC_OP_MODE.
       glIsEnabled with argument GL_COLOR_LOGIC_OP or GL_INDEX_LOGIC_OP.
