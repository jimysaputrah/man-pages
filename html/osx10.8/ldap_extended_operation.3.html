LDAP_EXTENDED_OPERATION(3)			    LDAP_EXTENDED_OPERATION(3)



NAME
       ldap_extended_operation,  ldap_extended_operation_s  - Extends the LDAP
       operations to the LDAP server.

LIBRARY
       OpenLDAP LDAP (libldap, -lldap)

SYNOPSIS
       #include &ltldap.h&gt

       int ldap_extended_operation(
	      LDAP *ld,
	      const char *requestoid,
	      const struct berval *requestdata,
	      LDAPControl **sctrls,
	      LDAPControl **cctrls,
	      int *msgidp );

       int ldap_extended_operation_s(
	      LDAP *ld,
	      const char *requestoid,
	      const struct berval *requestdata,
	      LDAPControl **sctrls,
	      LDAPControl **cctrls,
	      char **retoidp,
	      struct berval **retdatap );

DESCRIPTION
       The ldap_extended_operation_s() routine is used to  synchronously  per-
       form  an LDAP extended operation.  It takes requestoid, which points to
       a dotted-decimal OID string identifying the extended operation to  per-
       form.  requestdata  is  the data required for the request, sctrls is an
       array of LDAPControl structures to use with  this  extended  operation,
       cctrls  is an array of LDAPControl structures that list the client con-
       trols to use with this extended operation.

       The output parameter retoidp points  to	a  dotted-decimal  OID	string
       returned  by  the LDAP server.  The memory used by the string should be
       freed with the ldap_memfree(3) function.  The output parameter retdatap
       points  to  a  pointer to a berval structure that contains the returned
       data.  If no data is returned by the server, the pointer is set this to
       NULL.   The  memory  used  by  this  structure should be freed with the
       ber_bvfree(3) function.

       The  ldap_extended_operation()  works  just  like  ldap_extended_opera-
       tion_s(),  but  the operation is asynchronous.  It provides the message
       id of the request it initiated in the integer  pointed  to  be  msgidp.
       The result of this operation can be obtained by calling ldap_result(3).
