DROP AGGREGATE(7)	PostgreSQL 9.1.4 Documentation	     DROP AGGREGATE(7)



NAME
       DROP_AGGREGATE - remove an aggregate function

SYNOPSIS
       DROP AGGREGATE [ IF EXISTS ] name ( type [ , ... ] ) [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ]

DESCRIPTION
       DROP AGGREGATE removes an existing aggregate function. To execute this
       command the current user must be the owner of the aggregate function.

PARAMETERS
       IF EXISTS
	   Do not throw an error if the aggregate does not exist. A notice is
	   issued in this case.

       name
	   The name (optionally schema-qualified) of an existing aggregate
	   function.

       type
	   An input data type on which the aggregate function operates. To
	   reference a zero-argument aggregate function, write * in place of
	   the list of input data types.

       CASCADE
	   Automatically drop objects that depend on the aggregate function.

       RESTRICT
	   Refuse to drop the aggregate function if any objects depend on it.
	   This is the default.

EXAMPLES
       To remove the aggregate function myavg for type integer:

	   DROP AGGREGATE myavg(integer);

COMPATIBILITY
       There is no DROP AGGREGATE statement in the SQL standard.
