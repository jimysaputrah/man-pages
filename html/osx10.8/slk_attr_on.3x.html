DESCRIPTION
       The slk* functions manipulate the set of soft function-key labels  that
       exist on many terminals.  For those terminals that do not have soft la-
       bels, curses takes over the bottom line of stdscr, reducing the size of
       stdscr  and the variable LINES.	curses standardizes on eight labels of
       up to eight characters each. In addition to this, the ncurses implemen-
       tation supports a mode where it simulates 12 labels of up to five char-
       acters each. This is most common for todays PC  like  enduser  devices.
       Please  note  that ncurses simulates this mode by taking over up to two
       lines at the bottom of the screen, it does not try to use any  hardware
       support for this mode.

       The  slk_init  routine  must  be  called  before  initscr or newterm is
       called.	If initscr eventually uses a line from stdscr to  emulate  the
       soft  labels,  then  fmt  determines how the labels are arranged on the
       screen.	Setting fmt to 0 indicates a 3-2-3 arrangement of the  labels,
       1  indicates  a 4-4 arrangement and 2 indicates the PC like 4-4-4 mode.
       If fmt is set to 3, it is again the PC like 4-4-4 mode, but in addition
       an  index  line is generated, helping the user to identify the key num-
       bers easily.

       The slk_set routine requires labnum to be a label number, from 1  to  8
       (resp.  12);  label  must  be  the string to be put on the label, up to
       eight (resp. five) characters in length.   A  null  string  or  a  null
       pointer	sets  up  a  blank label. fmt is either 0, 1, or 2, indicating
       whether the label is  to be left-justified, centered,  or  right-justi-
       fied, respectively, within the label.

       The slk_refresh and slk_noutrefresh routines correspond to the wrefresh
       and wnoutrefresh routines.

       The slk_label routine returns the current label for label  number  lab-
       num, with leading and trailing blanks stripped.

       The slk_clear routine clears the soft labels from the screen.

       The  slk_restore routine restores the soft labels to the screen after a
       slk_clear has been performed.

       The slk_touch routine forces all the soft labels to be output the  next
       time a slk_noutrefresh is performed.

       The  slk_attron,  slk_attrset, slk_attroff and slk_attr routines corre-
       spond to attron, attrset, attroff and attr_get.	They  have  an	effect
       only  if  soft  labels  are simulated on the bottom line of the screen.
       The default highlight for soft keys is A_STANDOUT (as in System V curs-
       es, which does not document this fact).

       The  slk_color  routine corresponds to color_set. It has an effect only
       if soft labels are simulated on the bottom line of the screen.

RETURN VALUE
       These routines return ERR upon failure and OK (SVr4 specifies only  "an
       integer value other than ERR") upon successful completion.

       X/Open defines no error conditions.  In this implementation

	      slk_attr
		   returns the attribute used for the soft keys.

	      slk_attroff, slk_attron, slk_clear, slk_noutrefresh,
	      slk_refresh, slk_touch
		   return  an  error  if the terminal or the softkeys were not
		   initialized.

	      slk_attrset
		   returns an error if the terminal or the softkeys  were  not
		   initialized.

	      slk_attr_set
		   returns  an	error if the terminal or the softkeys were not
		   initialized, or the color pair is outside the range 0..COL-
		   OR_PAIRS-1, or opts is not null.

	      slk_color
		   returns  an	error if the terminal or the softkeys were not
		   initialized, or the color pair is outside the range 0..COL-
		   OR_PAIRS-1.

	      slk_init
		   returns  an	error  if  the format parameter is outside the
		   range 0..3.

	      slk_label
		   returns NULL on error.

	      slk_set
		   returns an error if the terminal or the softkeys  were  not
		   initialized,  or  the labnum parameter is outside the range
		   of label counts, or if the format parameter is outside  the
		   range  0..2, or if memory for the labels cannot be allocat-
		   ed.

NOTES
       Most applications would use slk_noutrefresh because a wrefresh is like-
       ly to follow soon.

PORTABILITY
       The  XSI  Curses  standard,  Issue  4,  describes  these functions.  It
       changes the  argument  type  of	the  attribute-manipulation  functions
       slk_attron, slk_attroff, slk_attrset to be attr_t, and adds const qual-
       ifiers. The format codes 2  and	3  for	slk_init()  and  the  function
       slk_attr are specific to ncurses.
