Date::Parse(3)	      User Contributed Perl Documentation	Date::Parse(3)



NAME
       Date::Parse - Parse date strings into time values

SYNOPSIS
	       use Date::Parse;

	       $time = str2time($date);

	       ($ss,$mm,$hh,$day,$month,$year,$zone) = strptime($date);

DESCRIPTION
       "Date::Parse" provides two routines for parsing date strings into time
       values.

       str2time(DATE [, ZONE])
	   "str2time" parses "DATE" and returns a unix time value, or undef
	   upon failure.  "ZONE", if given, specifies the timezone to assume
	   when parsing if the date string does not specify a timezone.

       strptime(DATE [, ZONE])
	   "strptime" takes the same arguments as str2time but returns an
	   array of values "($ss,$mm,$hh,$day,$month,$year,$zone)". Elements
	   are only defined if they could be extracted from the date string.
	   The $zone element is the timezone offset in seconds from GMT. An
	   empty array is returned upon failure.

MULTI-LANGUAGE SUPPORT
       Date::Parse is capable of parsing dates in several languages, these
       include English, French, German and Italian.

	       $lang = Date::Language-&gtnew('German');
	       $lang-&gtstr2time("25 Jun 1996 21:09:55 +0100");

EXAMPLE DATES
       Below is a sample list of dates that are known to be parsable with
       Date::Parse

	1995:01:24T09:08:17.1823213	      ISO-8601
	1995-01-24T09:08:17.1823213
	Wed, 16 Jun 94 07:29:35 CST	      Comma and day name are optional
	Thu, 13 Oct 94 10:13:13 -0700
	Wed, 9 Nov 1994 09:50:32 -0500 (EST)  Text in ()'s will be ignored.
	21 dec 17:05			      Will be parsed in the current time zone
	21-dec 17:05
	21/dec 17:05
	21/dec/93 17:05
	1999 10:02:18 "GMT"
	16 Nov 94 22:28:20 PST

LIMITATION
       Date::Parse uses Time::Local internally, so is limited to only parsing
       dates which result in valid values for Time::Local::timelocal. This
       generally means dates between 1901-12-17 00:00:00 GMT and 2038-01-16
       23:59:59 GMT

BUGS
       When both the month and the date are specified in the date as numbers
       they are always parsed assuming that the month number comes before the
       date. This is the usual format used in American dates.

       The reason why it is like this and not dynamic is that it must be
       deterministic. Several people have suggested using the current locale,
       but this will not work as the date being parsed may not be in the
       format of the current locale.

       My plans to address this, which will be in a future release, is to
       allow the programmer to state what order they want these values parsed
       in.
