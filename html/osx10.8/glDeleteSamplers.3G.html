NAME
       glDeleteSamplers - delete named sampler objects

C SPECIFICATION
       void glDeleteSamplers(GLsizei n, const GLuint * ids);

PARAMETERS
       n
	   Specifies the number of sampler objects to be deleted.

       ids
	   Specifies an array of sampler objects to be deleted.

DESCRIPTION
       glDeleteSamplers deletes n sampler objects named by the elements of the
       array ids. After a sampler object is deleted, its name is again unused.
       If a sampler object that is currently bound to a sampler unit is
       deleted, it is as though glBindSampler() is called with unit set to the
       unit the sampler is bound to and sampler zero. Unused names in samplers
       are silently ignored, as is the reserved name zero.

NOTES
       glDeleteSamplers is available only if the GL version is 3.3 or higher.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if n is negative.

ASSOCIATED GETS
       glIsSampler()

       glGenSamplers(), glBindSampler(), glDeleteSamplers(), glIsSampler()
