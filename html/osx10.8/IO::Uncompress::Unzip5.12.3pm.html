DESCRIPTION
       This module provides a Perl interface that allows the reading of zlib
       files/buffers.

       For writing zip files/buffers, see the companion module
       IO::Compress::Zip.

Functional Interface
       A top-level function, "unzip", is provided to carry out "one-shot"
       uncompression between buffers and/or files. For finer control over the
       uncompression process, see the "OO Interface" section.

	   use IO::Uncompress::Unzip qw(unzip $UnzipError) ;

	   unzip $input => $output [,OPTS]
	       or die "unzip failed: $UnzipError\n";

       The functional interface needs Perl5.005 or better.

   unzip $input => $output [, OPTS]
       "unzip" expects at least two parameters, $input and $output.

       The $input parameter

       The parameter, $input, is used to define the source of the compressed
       data.

       It can take one of the following forms:

       A filename
	    If the $input parameter is a simple scalar, it is assumed to be a
	    filename. This file will be opened for reading and the input data
	    will be read from it.

       A filehandle
	    If the $input parameter is a filehandle, the input data will be
	    read from it.  The string '-' can be used as an alias for standard
	    input.

       A scalar reference
	    If $input is a scalar reference, the input data will be read from
	    $$input.

       An array reference
	    If $input is an array reference, each element in the array must be
	    a filename.

	    The input data will be read from each file in turn.

	    The complete array will be walked to ensure that it only contains
	    valid filenames before any data is uncompressed.

       An Input FileGlob string
	    If $input is a string that is delimited by the characters "<" and
	    ">" "unzip" will assume that it is an input fileglob string. The
	    input is the list of files that match the fileglob.

	    If the fileglob does not match any files ...

	    See File::GlobMapper for more details.

       If the $input parameter is any other type, "undef" will be returned.

       The $output parameter

       The parameter $output is used to control the destination of the
       uncompressed data. This parameter can take one of these forms.

       A filename
	    If the $output parameter is a simple scalar, it is assumed to be a
	    filename.  This file will be opened for writing and the
	    uncompressed data will be written to it.

       A filehandle
	    If the $output parameter is a filehandle, the uncompressed data
	    will be written to it.  The string '-' can be used as an alias for
	    standard output.

       A scalar reference
	    If $output is a scalar reference, the uncompressed data will be
	    stored in $$output.

       An Array Reference
	    If $output is an array reference, the uncompressed data will be
	    pushed onto the array.

       An Output FileGlob
	    If $output is a string that is delimited by the characters "<" and
	    ">" "unzip" will assume that it is an output fileglob string. The
	    output is the list of files that match the fileglob.

	    When $output is an fileglob string, $input must also be a fileglob
	    string. Anything else is an error.

       If the $output parameter is any other type, "undef" will be returned.

   Notes
       When $input maps to multiple compressed files/buffers and $output is a
       single file/buffer, after uncompression $output will contain a
       concatenation of all the uncompressed data from each of the input
       files/buffers.

   Optional Parameters
       Unless specified below, the optional parameters for "unzip", "OPTS",
       are the same as those used with the OO interface defined in the
       "Constructor Options" section below.

       "AutoClose => 0|1"
	    This option applies to any input or output data streams to "unzip"
	    that are filehandles.

	    If "AutoClose" is specified, and the value is true, it will result
	    in all input and/or output filehandles being closed once "unzip"
	    has completed.

	    This parameter defaults to 0.

       "BinModeOut => 0|1"
	    When writing to a file or filehandle, set "binmode" before writing
	    to the file.

	    Defaults to 0.

       "Append => 0|1"
	    The behaviour of this option is dependent on the type of output
	    data stream.

	    o	 A Buffer

		 If "Append" is enabled, all uncompressed data will be append
		 to the end of the output buffer. Otherwise the output buffer
		 will be cleared before any uncompressed data is written to
		 it.

	    o	 A Filename

		 If "Append" is enabled, the file will be opened in append
		 mode. Otherwise the contents of the file, if any, will be
		 truncated before any uncompressed data is written to it.

	    o	 A Filehandle

		 If "Append" is enabled, the filehandle will be positioned to
		 the end of the file via a call to "seek" before any
		 uncompressed data is written to it.  Otherwise the file
		 pointer will not be moved.

	    When "Append" is specified, and set to true, it will append all
	    uncompressed data to the output data stream.

	    So when the output is a filehandle it will carry out a seek to the
	    eof before writing any uncompressed data. If the output is a
	    filename, it will be opened for appending. If the output is a
	    buffer, all uncompressed data will be appened to the existing
	    buffer.

	    Conversely when "Append" is not specified, or it is present and is
	    set to false, it will operate as follows.

	    When the output is a filename, it will truncate the contents of
	    the file before writing any uncompressed data. If the output is a
	    filehandle its position will not be changed. If the output is a
	    buffer, it will be wiped before any uncompressed data is output.

	    Defaults to 0.

       "MultiStream => 0|1"
	    If the input file/buffer contains multiple compressed data
	    streams, this option will uncompress the whole lot as a single
	    data stream.

	    Defaults to 0.

       "TrailingData => $scalar"
	    Returns the data, if any, that is present immediately after the
	    compressed data stream once uncompression is complete.

	    This option can be used when there is useful information
	    immediately following the compressed data stream, and you don't
	    know the length of the compressed data stream.

	    If the input is a buffer, "trailingData" will return everything
	    from the end of the compressed data stream to the end of the
	    buffer.

	    If the input is a filehandle, "trailingData" will return the data
	    that is left in the filehandle input buffer once the end of the
	    compressed data stream has been reached. You can then use the
	    filehandle to read the rest of the input file.

	    Don't bother using "trailingData" if the input is a filename.

	    If you know the length of the compressed data stream before you
	    start uncompressing, you can avoid having to use "trailingData" by
	    setting the "InputLength" option.

   Examples
       To read the contents of the file "file1.txt.zip" and write the
       uncompressed data to the file "file1.txt".

	   use strict ;
	   use warnings ;
	   use IO::Uncompress::Unzip qw(unzip $UnzipError) ;

	   my $input = "file1.txt.zip";
	   my $output = "file1.txt";
	   unzip $input => $output
	       or die "unzip failed: $UnzipError\n";

       To read from an existing Perl filehandle, $input, and write the
       uncompressed data to a buffer, $buffer.

	   use strict ;
	   use warnings ;
	   use IO::Uncompress::Unzip qw(unzip $UnzipError) ;
	   use IO::File ;

	   my $input = new IO::File "<file1.txt.zip"
	       or die "Cannot open 'file1.txt.zip': $!\n" ;
	   my $buffer ;
	   unzip $input => \$buffer
	       or die "unzip failed: $UnzipError\n";

       To uncompress all files in the directory "/my/home" that match
       "*.txt.zip" and store the compressed data in the same directory

	   use strict ;
	   use warnings ;
	   use IO::Uncompress::Unzip qw(unzip $UnzipError) ;

	   unzip '</my/home/*.txt.zip>' => '</my/home/#1.txt>'
	       or die "unzip failed: $UnzipError\n";

       and if you want to compress each file one at a time, this will do the
       trick

	   use strict ;
	   use warnings ;
	   use IO::Uncompress::Unzip qw(unzip $UnzipError) ;

	   for my $input ( glob "/my/home/*.txt.zip" )
	   {
	       my $output = $input;
	       $output =~ s/.zip// ;
	       unzip $input => $output
		   or die "Error compressing '$input': $UnzipError\n";
	   }

OO Interface
   Constructor
       The format of the constructor for IO::Uncompress::Unzip is shown below

	   my $z = new IO::Uncompress::Unzip $input [OPTS]
	       or die "IO::Uncompress::Unzip failed: $UnzipError\n";

       Returns an "IO::Uncompress::Unzip" object on success and undef on
       failure.  The variable $UnzipError will contain an error message on
       failure.

       If you are running Perl 5.005 or better the object, $z, returned from
       IO::Uncompress::Unzip can be used exactly like an IO::File filehandle.
       This means that all normal input file operations can be carried out
       with $z.  For example, to read a line from a compressed file/buffer you
       can use either of these forms

	   $line = $z->getline();
	   $line = <$z>;

       The mandatory parameter $input is used to determine the source of the
       compressed data. This parameter can take one of three forms.

       A filename
	    If the $input parameter is a scalar, it is assumed to be a
	    filename. This file will be opened for reading and the compressed
	    data will be read from it.

       A filehandle
	    If the $input parameter is a filehandle, the compressed data will
	    be read from it.  The string '-' can be used as an alias for
	    standard input.

       A scalar reference
	    If $input is a scalar reference, the compressed data will be read
	    from $$output.

   Constructor Options
       The option names defined below are case insensitive and can be
       optionally prefixed by a '-'.  So all of the following are valid

	   -AutoClose
	   -autoclose
	   AUTOCLOSE
	   autoclose

       OPTS is a combination of the following options:

       "AutoClose => 0|1"
	    This option is only valid when the $input parameter is a
	    filehandle. If specified, and the value is true, it will result in
	    the file being closed once either the "close" method is called or
	    the IO::Uncompress::Unzip object is destroyed.

	    This parameter defaults to 0.

       "MultiStream => 0|1"
	    Treats the complete zip file/buffer as a single compressed data
	    stream. When reading in multi-stream mode each member of the zip
	    file/buffer will be uncompressed in turn until the end of the
	    file/buffer is encountered.

	    This parameter defaults to 0.

       "Prime => $string"
	    This option will uncompress the contents of $string before
	    processing the input file/buffer.

	    This option can be useful when the compressed data is embedded in
	    another file/data structure and it is not possible to work out
	    where the compressed data begins without having to read the first
	    few bytes. If this is the case, the uncompression can be primed
	    with these bytes using this option.

       "Transparent => 0|1"
	    If this option is set and the input file/buffer is not compressed
	    data, the module will allow reading of it anyway.

	    In addition, if the input file/buffer does contain compressed data
	    and there is non-compressed data immediately following it, setting
	    this option will make this module treat the whole file/bufffer as
	    a single data stream.

	    This option defaults to 1.

       "BlockSize => $num"
	    When reading the compressed input data, IO::Uncompress::Unzip will
	    read it in blocks of $num bytes.

	    This option defaults to 4096.

       "InputLength => $size"
	    When present this option will limit the number of compressed bytes
	    read from the input file/buffer to $size. This option can be used
	    in the situation where there is useful data directly after the
	    compressed data stream and you know beforehand the exact length of
	    the compressed data stream.

	    This option is mostly used when reading from a filehandle, in
	    which case the file pointer will be left pointing to the first
	    byte directly after the compressed data stream.

	    This option defaults to off.

       "Append => 0|1"
	    This option controls what the "read" method does with uncompressed
	    data.

	    If set to 1, all uncompressed data will be appended to the output
	    parameter of the "read" method.

	    If set to 0, the contents of the output parameter of the "read"
	    method will be overwritten by the uncompressed data.

	    Defaults to 0.

       "Strict => 0|1"
	    This option controls whether the extra checks defined below are
	    used when carrying out the decompression. When Strict is on, the
	    extra tests are carried out, when Strict is off they are not.

	    The default for this option is off.

   Examples
       TODO

Methods
   read
       Usage is

	   $status = $z->read($buffer)

       Reads a block of compressed data (the size the the compressed block is
       determined by the "Buffer" option in the constructor), uncompresses it
       and writes any uncompressed data into $buffer. If the "Append"
       parameter is set in the constructor, the uncompressed data will be
       appended to the $buffer parameter. Otherwise $buffer will be
       overwritten.

       Returns the number of uncompressed bytes written to $buffer, zero if
       eof or a negative number on error.

   read
       Usage is

	   $status = $z->read($buffer, $length)
	   $status = $z->read($buffer, $length, $offset)

	   $status = read($z, $buffer, $length)
	   $status = read($z, $buffer, $length, $offset)

       Attempt to read $length bytes of uncompressed data into $buffer.

       The main difference between this form of the "read" method and the
       previous one, is that this one will attempt to return exactly $length
       bytes. The only circumstances that this function will not is if end-of-
       file or an IO error is encountered.

       Returns the number of uncompressed bytes written to $buffer, zero if
       eof or a negative number on error.

   getline
       Usage is

	   $line = $z->getline()
	   $line = <$z>

       Reads a single line.

       This method fully supports the use of of the variable $/ (or
       $INPUT_RECORD_SEPARATOR or $RS when "English" is in use) to determine
       what constitutes an end of line. Paragraph mode, record mode and file
       slurp mode are all supported.

   getc
       Usage is

	   $char = $z->getc()

       Read a single character.

   ungetc
       Usage is

	   $char = $z->ungetc($string)

   inflateSync
       Usage is

	   $status = $z->inflateSync()

       TODO

   getHeaderInfo
       Usage is

	   $hdr  = $z->getHeaderInfo();
	   @hdrs = $z->getHeaderInfo();

       This method returns either a hash reference (in scalar context) or a
       list or hash references (in array context) that contains information
       about each of the header fields in the compressed data stream(s).

   tell
       Usage is

	   $z->tell()
	   tell $z

       Returns the uncompressed file offset.

   eof
       Usage is

	   $z->eof();
	   eof($z);

       Returns true if the end of the compressed input stream has been
       reached.

   seek
	   $z->seek($position, $whence);
	   seek($z, $position, $whence);

       Provides a sub-set of the "seek" functionality, with the restriction
       that it is only legal to seek forward in the input file/buffer.	It is
       a fatal error to attempt to seek backward.

       The $whence parameter takes one the usual values, namely SEEK_SET,
       SEEK_CUR or SEEK_END.

       Returns 1 on success, 0 on failure.

   binmode
       Usage is

	   $z->binmode
	   binmode $z ;

       This is a noop provided for completeness.

   opened
	   $z->opened()

       Returns true if the object currently refers to a opened file/buffer.

   autoflush
	   my $prev = $z->autoflush()
	   my $prev = $z->autoflush(EXPR)

       If the $z object is associated with a file or a filehandle, this method
       returns the current autoflush setting for the underlying filehandle. If
       "EXPR" is present, and is non-zero, it will enable flushing after every
       write/print operation.

       If $z is associated with a buffer, this method has no effect and always
       returns "undef".

       Note that the special variable $| cannot be used to set or retrieve the
       autoflush setting.

   input_line_number
	   $z->input_line_number()
	   $z->input_line_number(EXPR)

       Returns the current uncompressed line number. If "EXPR" is present it
       has the effect of setting the line number. Note that setting the line
       number does not change the current position within the file/buffer
       being read.

       The contents of $/ are used to to determine what constitutes a line
       terminator.

   fileno
	   $z->fileno()
	   fileno($z)

       If the $z object is associated with a file or a filehandle, "fileno"
       will return the underlying file descriptor. Once the "close" method is
       called "fileno" will return "undef".

       If the $z object is is associated with a buffer, this method will
       return "undef".

   close
	   $z->close() ;
	   close $z ;

       Closes the output file/buffer.

       For most versions of Perl this method will be automatically invoked if
       the IO::Uncompress::Unzip object is destroyed (either explicitly or by
       the variable with the reference to the object going out of scope). The
       exceptions are Perl versions 5.005 through 5.00504 and 5.8.0. In these
       cases, the "close" method will be called automatically, but not until
       global destruction of all live objects when the program is terminating.

       Therefore, if you want your scripts to be able to run on all versions
       of Perl, you should call "close" explicitly and not rely on automatic
       closing.

       Returns true on success, otherwise 0.

       If the "AutoClose" option has been enabled when the
       IO::Uncompress::Unzip object was created, and the object is associated
       with a file, the underlying file will also be closed.

   nextStream
       Usage is

	   my $status = $z->nextStream();

       Skips to the next compressed data stream in the input file/buffer. If a
       new compressed data stream is found, the eof marker will be cleared and
       $.  will be reset to 0.

       Returns 1 if a new stream was found, 0 if none was found, and -1 if an
       error was encountered.

   trailingData
       Usage is

	   my $data = $z->trailingData();

       Returns the data, if any, that is present immediately after the
       compressed data stream once uncompression is complete. It only makes
       sense to call this method once the end of the compressed data stream
       has been encountered.

       This option can be used when there is useful information immediately
       following the compressed data stream, and you don't know the length of
       the compressed data stream.

       If the input is a buffer, "trailingData" will return everything from
       the end of the compressed data stream to the end of the buffer.

       If the input is a filehandle, "trailingData" will return the data that
       is left in the filehandle input buffer once the end of the compressed
       data stream has been reached. You can then use the filehandle to read
       the rest of the input file.

       Don't bother using "trailingData" if the input is a filename.

       If you know the length of the compressed data stream before you start
       uncompressing, you can avoid having to use "trailingData" by setting
       the "InputLength" option in the constructor.
