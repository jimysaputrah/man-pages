NAME
       Class::Accessor::Faster - Even faster, but less expandable, accessors

SYNOPSIS
	 package Foo;
	 use base qw(Class::Accessor::Faster);

DESCRIPTION
       This is a faster but less expandable version of Class::Accessor::Fast.

       Class::Accessor's generated accessors require two method calls to
       accompish their task (one for the accessor, another for get() or
       set()).

       Class::Accessor::Fast eliminates calling set()/get() and does the
       access itself, resulting in a somewhat faster accessor.

       Class::Accessor::Faster uses an array reference underneath to be
       faster.

       Read the documentation for Class::Accessor for more info.
