NAME
       gluTessBeginPolygon - delimit a polygon description


C SPECIFICATION
       void gluTessBeginPolygon( GLUtesselator* tess,
				 GLvoid* data )


PARAMETERS
       tess  Specifies the tessellation object (created with gluNewTess).

       data  Specifies a pointer to user polygon data.

DESCRIPTION
       gluTessBeginPolygon  and  gluTessEndPolygon delimit the definition of a
       convex,	 concave   or	self-intersecting   polygon.	Within	  each
       gluTessBeginPolygon/gluTessEndPolygon  pair,  there must be one or more
       calls to gluTessBeginContour/gluTessEndContour.	Within	each  contour,
       there  are  zero or more calls to gluTessVertex. The vertices specify a
       closed contour (the last vertex of each contour is automatically linked
       to   the   first).  See	the  gluTessVertex,  gluTessBeginContour,  and
       gluTessEndContour reference pages for more details.

       data is a pointer to a user-defined data structure. If the  appropriate
       callback(s)  are  specified (see gluTessCallback), then this pointer is
       returned to the callback function(s). Thus, it is a convenient  way  to
       store per-polygon information.

       Once  gluTessEndPolygon	is called, the polygon is tessellated, and the
       resulting   triangles   are   described	 through    callbacks.	   See
       gluTessCallback for descriptions of the callback functions.

EXAMPLE
       A  quadrilateral  with a triangular hole in it can be described as fol-
       lows:

       gluTessBeginPolygon(tobj, NULL);
	gluTessBeginContour(tobj);
	  gluTessVertex(tobj, v1, v1);
	  gluTessVertex(tobj, v2, v2);
	  gluTessVertex(tobj, v3, v3);
	  gluTessVertex(tobj, v4, v4);
	gluTessEndContour(tobj);
	gluTessBeginContour(tobj);
	  gluTessVertex(tobj, v5, v5);
	  gluTessVertex(tobj, v6, v6);
	  gluTessVertex(tobj, v7, v7);
	gluTessEndContour(tobj); gluTessEndPolygon(tobj);
