NAME
       glDeleteRenderbuffers - delete renderbuffer objects

C SPECIFICATION
       void glDeleteRenderbuffers(GLsizei n, GLuint *renderbuffers);

PARAMETERS
       n
	   Specifies the number of renderbuffer objects to be deleted.

       renderbuffers
	   A pointer to an array containing n renderbuffer objects to be
	   deleted.

DESCRIPTION
       glDeleteRenderbuffers deletes the n renderbuffer objects whose names
       are stored in the array addressed by renderbuffers. The name zero is
       reserved by the GL and is silently ignored, should it occur in
       renderbuffers, as are other unused names. Once a renderbuffer object is
       deleted, its name is again unused and it has no contents. If a
       renderbuffer that is currently bound to the target GL_RENDERBUFFER is
       deleted, it is as though glBindRenderbuffer() had been executed with a
       target of GL_RENDERBUFFER and a name of zero.

       If a renderbuffer object is attached to one or more attachment points
       in the currently bound framebuffer, then it as if
       glFramebufferRenderbuffer() had been called, with a renderbuffer of
       zero for each attachment point to which this image was attached in the
       currently bound framebuffer. In other words, this renderbuffer object
       is first detached from all attachment ponits in the currently bound
       framebuffer. Note that the renderbuffer image is specifically not
       detached from any non-bound framebuffers.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if n is negative.
