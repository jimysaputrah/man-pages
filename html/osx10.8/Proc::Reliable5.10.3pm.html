NAME
       Proc::Reliable -- Run external processes reliably with many options.

SYNOPSIS
       use Proc::Reliable;

       Create a new process object

	  $myproc = Proc::Reliable-&gtnew();

       Run a subprocess and collect its output

	  $output = $myproc-&gtrun("/bin/ls -l");

       Check for problems

	  if($myproc-&gtstatus()) {
	    print("problem!\n");
	  }

       Run another subprocess, keeping stdout and stderr separated.  Also,
       send the subprocess some data on stdin.

	  $msg = "Hello World\n");
	  $p-&gtwant_single_list(0);
	  $stdout = $p-&gtrun("/usr/bin/fastmail - foo@bar.com", $msg);
	  if($p-&gtstatus()) {
	    print("problem: ", $p-&gtstderr(), "\n");
	  }

       Another way to get output

	  ($stdout, $stderr, $status, $msg) = $p-&gtrun("/bin/ls -l");

OVERVIEW
       Proc::Reliable is a class for simple, reliable and configurable
       subprocess execution in perl.  In particular, it is especially useful
       for managing the execution of 'problem' programs which are likely to
       fail, hang, or otherwise behave in an unruly manner.

       Proc::Reliable includes all the functionality of the backticks operator
       and system() functions, plus many common uses of fork() and exec(),
       open2() and open3().  Proc::Reliable incorporates a number of options,
       including sending data to the subprocess on STDIN, collecting STDOUT
       and STDERR separately or together, killing hung processes, timouts and
       automatic retries.

DESCRIPTION
       A new process object is created by

	  $myproc = Proc::Reliable-&gtnew();

       The default will run a subprocess only once with a 60-second timeout.
       Either shell-like command lines or references to perl subroutines can
       be specified for launching a process in background.  A simple list
       process, for example, can be started via the shell as

	  $out = $myproc-&gtrun("ls");

       To separate stdout, stderr, and exit status:

	  ($out, $err, $status, $msg) = $myproc-&gtrun("ls");

       The output data is also stored within the $myproc object for later
       retrieval.  You can also run a perl subroutine in a subprocess, with

	  $myproc-&gtrun(sub { return &lt*&gt; });

       The run Method will try to run the named process.  If the process times
       out (after time_per_try seconds) or has an error defined as
       unacceptable and you would like to re-run it, you can use the num_tries
       option.	Use the time_btw_tries option to set the number of seconds
       between runs.  This can repeat until maxtime seconds have elapsed.

       When using num_tries, the user can specify what constitutes an
       unacceptable error of STDOUT or STDERR output -- i.e. demanding a
       retry.  One common shorthand is to have the run method retry if there
       is any return from STDERR.

	  $myproc-&gtaccept_no_error();	 # Re-try if any STDERR
	  $myproc-&gtpattern_stdout($pat); # require STDOUT to match regex $pat
	  $myproc-&gtpattern_stderr($pat); # require STDERR to match regex $pat

       Subprocess completion is detected when the process closes all
       filehandles.  The process must then exit before child_exit_time
       expires, or it will be killed.  If the subprocess does not exit, it is
       sent a TERM signal unless sigterm_exit_time is 0.  then if it does not
       exit before sigterm_exit_time expires, it is sent a KILL signal unless
       sigkill_exit_time is 0.	then if it does not exit before
       sigkill_exit_time expires an error is generated.  waiting is done in
       0.01 second increments.

       Proc::Reliable is not MT-Safe due to signals usage.

METHODS
       The following methods are available:

       new (Constructor)
	   Create a new instance of this class by writing either

	       $proc = new Proc::Reliable;   or   $proc = Proc::Reliable-&gtnew();

	   The new method accepts any valid configuration options:

	       $proc = Proc::Reliable-&gtnew('maxtime' =&gt 200, 'num_tries' =&gt 3);

       run Run a new process and collect the standard output and standard
	   error via separate pipes.

	     $out = $proc-&gtrun("program-name");
	    ($out, $err, $status, $msg) = $proc-&gtrun("program-name");

	   by default with a single return value, stdout and stderr are
	   combined to a single stream and returned.  with 4 return values,
	   stdout and stderr are separated, and the program exit status is
	   also returned.  $msg contains messages from Proc::Reliable when
	   errors occur.  Set want_single_list(1) to force stdout and stderr
	   to be combined, and want_single_list(0) to force them separated.
	   The results from run() are stored as member data also:

	     $proc-&gtwant_single_list(0);
	     $proc-&gtrun("program");
	     if($proc-&gtstatus) {
	       print($proc-&gtstderr);
	       exit;
	     }
	     else {
	       print($proc-&gtstdout);
	     }

	   Program exit status is returned in the same format as exec(): bits
	   0-7 set if program exited from a signal, bits 8-15 are the exit
	   status on a normal program exit.

	   You can also set up callbacks to run a function of your choice as
	   each line of stdout and stderr is produced by the child process
	   using the stdout_cb and stderr_cb options.

	   There are a number of other options.  You can also feed the forked
	   program data on stdin via a second argument to run():

	    $myinput = "hello\ntest\n";
	    $output = $proc-&gtrun("program-name", $myinput);

	   The first option to run() supports three forms: 1) string
	   containing command string to execute.  this incurs shell parsing.
	   2) arrayref containing split command string to execute.  this
	   bypasses shell parsing.  3) coderef to perl function.  The first
	   two options are executed via exec(), so the specifics of incurring
	   shell parsing are the same.

	   The second option to run() supports two forms: 1) string containing
	   data to feed on stdin 2) stringref pointing to data to feed on
	   stdin

	   You can start execution of an independent Perl function (like
	   "eval" except with timeout, retries, etc.).	Simply provide the
	   function reference like

	    $output = $proc-&gtrun(\&perl_function);

	   or supply an unnamed subroutine:

	    $output = $proc-&gtrun( sub { sleep(1) } );

	   The run Method returns after the the function finishes, one way or
	   another.

       debug
	   Switches debug messages on and off -- Proc::Reliable::debug(1)
	   switches them on, Proc::Reliable::debug(0) keeps Proc::Reliable
	   quiet.

       maxtime
	   Return or set the maximum time in seconds per run method call.
	   Default is 300 seconds (i.e. 5 minutes).

       num_tries
	   Return or set the maximum number of tries the run method will
	   attempt an operation if there are unallowed errors.	Default is 5.

       time_per_try
	   Return or set the maximum time in seconds for each attempt which
	   run makes of an operation.  Multiple tries in case of error can go
	   longer than this.  Default is 30 seconds.

       time_btw_tries
	   Return or set the time in seconds between attempted operations in
	   case of unacceptable error.	Default is 5 seconds.

       child_exit_time
	   When the subprocess closes stdout, it is assumed to have completed
	   normal operation.  It is expected to exit within the amount of time
	   specified.  If it does not exit, it will be killed (with SIGTERM).
	   This option can be disabled by setting to '0'.  Values are in
	   seconds, with a resolution of 0.01.

       sigterm_exit_time
	   If the time_per_try or max_time has been exceeded, or if
	   child_exit_time action has not succeeded, the subprocess will be
	   killed with SIGTERM.  This option specifies the amount of time to
	   allow the process to exit after closing stdout.  This option can be
	   disabled by setting to '0'.	Values are in seconds, with a
	   resolution of 0.01.

       sigkill_exit_time
	   Similar to sigterm_exit_time, but a SIGKILL is sent instead of a
	   SIGTERM.  When both options are enabled, the SIGTERM is sent first
	   and SIGKILL is then sent after the specified time only if the
	   subprocess is still alive.  This option can be disabled by setting
	   to '0'.  Values are in seconds, with a resolution of 0.01.

       input_chunking
	   If data is being written to the subprocess on stdin, this option
	   will cause the module to split() the input data at linefeeds, and
	   only feed the subprocess a line at a time.  This option typically
	   would be used when the subprocess is an application with a command
	   prompt and does not work properly when all the data is fed on stdin
	   at once.  The module will feed the subprocess one line of data on
	   stdin, and will then wait until some data is produced by the
	   subprocess on stdout or stderr.  It will then feed the next line of
	   data on stdin.

       stdout_cb
	   Set up a callback function to get stdout data from the child line-
	   by-line.  The function you supply will be called whenever the child
	   prints a line onto stdout.  This is the only way to get output from
	   the child while it is still running, the normal method will give
	   you all the output at once after the child exits.

       stderr_cb
	   Similar to stdout_cb for stderr data.

REQUIREMENTS
       I recommend using at least perl 5.003.
