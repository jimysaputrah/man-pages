NAME
       CPANPLUS::Module

SYNOPSIS
	   ### get a module object from the CPANPLUS::Backend object
	   my $mod = $cb->module_tree('Some::Module');

	   ### accessors
	   $mod->version;
	   $mod->package;

	   ### methods
	   $mod->fetch;
	   $mod->extract;
	   $mod->install;

DESCRIPTION
       "CPANPLUS::Module" creates objects from the information in the source
       files. These can then be used to query and perform actions on, like
       fetching or installing.

       These objects should only be created internally. For "fake" objects,
       there's the "CPANPLUS::Module::Fake" class. To obtain a module object
       consult the "CPANPLUS::Backend" documentation.

CLASS METHODS
   accessors ()
       Returns a list of all accessor methods to the object

ACCESSORS
       An objects of this class has the following accessors:

       name
	   Name of the module.

       module
	   Name of the module.

       version
	   Version of the module. Defaults to '0.0' if none was provided.

       path
	   Extended path on the mirror.

       comment
	   Any comment about the module -- largely unused.

       package
	   The name of the package.

       description
	   Description of the module -- only registered modules have this.

       dslip
	   The five character dslip string, that represents meta-data of the
	   module -- again, only registered modules have this.

       status
	   The "CPANPLUS::Module::Status" object associated with this object.
	   (see below).

       author
	   The "CPANPLUS::Module::Author" object associated with this object.

       parent
	   The "CPANPLUS::Internals" object that spawned this module object.

STATUS ACCESSORS
       "CPANPLUS" caches a lot of results from method calls and saves data it
       collected along the road for later reuse.

       "CPANPLUS" uses this internally, but it is also available for the end
       user. You can get a status object by calling:

	   $modobj->status

       You can then query the object as follows:

       installer_type
	   The installer type used for this distribution. Will be one of
	   'makemaker' or 'build'. This determines whether
	   "CPANPLUS::Dist::MM" or "CPANPLUS::Dist::Build" will be used to
	   build this distribution.

       dist_cpan
	   The dist object used to do the CPAN-side of the installation.
	   Either a "CPANPLUS::Dist::MM" or "CPANPLUS::Dist::Build" object.

       dist
	   The custom dist object used to do the operating specific side of
	   the installation, if you've chosen to use this. For example, if
	   you've chosen to install using the "ports" format, this may be a
	   "CPANPLUS::Dist::Ports" object.

	   Undefined if you didn't specify a separate format to install
	   through.

       prereqs | requires
	   A hashref of prereqs this distribution was found to have. Will look
	   something like this:

	       { Carp  => 0.01, strict => 0 }

	   Might be undefined if the distribution didn't have any
	   prerequisites.

       configure_requires
	   Like prereqs, but these are necessary to be installed before the
	   build process can even begin.

       signature
	   Flag indicating, if a signature check was done, whether it was OK
	   or not.

       extract
	   The directory this distribution was extracted to.

       fetch
	   The location this distribution was fetched to.

       readme
	   The text of this distributions README file.

       uninstall
	   Flag indicating if an uninstall call was done successfully.

       created
	   Flag indicating if the "create" call to your dist object was done
	   successfully.

       installed
	   Flag indicating if the "install" call to your dist object was done
	   successfully.

       checksums
	   The location of this distributions CHECKSUMS file.

       checksum_ok
	   Flag indicating if the checksums check was done successfully.

       checksum_value
	   The checksum value this distribution is expected to have

METHODS
   $self = CPANPLUS::Module->new( OPTIONS )
       This method returns a "CPANPLUS::Module" object. Normal users should
       never call this method directly, but instead use the
       "CPANPLUS::Backend" to obtain module objects.

       This example illustrates a "new()" call with all required arguments:

	       CPANPLUS::Module->new(
		   module  => 'Foo',
		   path    => 'authors/id/A/AA/AAA',
		   package => 'Foo-1.0.tgz',
		   author  => $author_object,
		   _id	   => INTERNALS_OBJECT_ID,
	       );

       Every accessor is also a valid option to pass to "new".

       Returns a module object on success and false on failure.

   $mod->package_name( [$package_string] )
       Returns the name of the package a module is in. For "Acme::Bleach" that
       might be "Acme-Bleach".

   $mod->package_version( [$package_string] )
       Returns the version of the package a module is in. For a module in the
       package "Acme-Bleach-1.1.tar.gz" this would be 1.1.

   $mod->package_extension( [$package_string] )
       Returns the suffix added by the compression method of a package a
       certain module is in. For a module in "Acme-Bleach-1.1.tar.gz", this
       would be "tar.gz".

   $mod->package_is_perl_core
       Returns a boolean indicating of the package a particular module is in,
       is actually a core perl distribution.

   $mod->module_is_supplied_with_perl_core( [version => $]] )
       Returns a boolean indicating whether "ANY VERSION" of this module was
       supplied with the current running perl's core package.

   $mod->is_bundle
       Returns a boolean indicating if the module you are looking at, is
       actually a bundle. Bundles are identified as modules whose name starts
       with "Bundle::".

   $mod->is_autobundle;
       Returns a boolean indicating if the module you are looking at, is
       actually an autobundle as generated by "$cb->autobundle".

   $mod->is_third_party
       Returns a boolean indicating whether the package is a known third-party
       module (i.e. it's not provided by the standard Perl distribution and is
       not available on the CPAN, but on a third party software provider).
       See Module::ThirdParty for more details.

   $mod->third_party_information
       Returns a reference to a hash with more information about a third-party
       module. See the documentation about "module_information()" in
       Module::ThirdParty for more details.

   $clone = $self->clone
       Clones the current module object for tinkering with.  It will have a
       clean "CPANPLUS::Module::Status" object, as well as a fake
       "CPANPLUS::Module::Author" object.

   $where = $self->fetch
       Fetches the module from a CPAN mirror.  Look at
       CPANPLUS::Internals::Fetch::_fetch() for details on the options you can
       pass.

   $path = $self->extract
       Extracts the fetched module.  Look at
       CPANPLUS::Internals::Extract::_extract() for details on the options you
       can pass.

   $type = $self->get_installer_type([prefer_makefile => BOOL])
       Gets the installer type for this module. This may either be "build" or
       "makemaker". If "Module::Build" is unavailable or no installer type is
       available, it will fall back to "makemaker". If both are available, it
       will pick the one indicated by your config, or by the "prefer_makefile"
       option you can pass to this function.

       Returns the installer type on success, and false on error.

   $dist = $self->dist([target => 'prepare|create', format =>
       DISTRIBUTION_TYPE, args => {key => val}]);
       Create a distribution object, ready to be installed.  Distribution type
       defaults to your config settings

       The optional "args" hashref is passed on to the specific distribution
       types' "create" method after being dereferenced.

       Returns a distribution object on success, false on failure.

       See "CPANPLUS::Dist" for details.

   $bool = $mod->prepare( )
       Convenience method around "install()" that prepares a module without
       actually building it. This is equivalent to invoking "install" with
       "target" set to "prepare"

       Returns true on success, false on failure.

   $bool = $mod->create( )
       Convenience method around "install()" that creates a module.  This is
       equivalent to invoking "install" with "target" set to "create"

       Returns true on success, false on failure.

   $bool = $mod->test( )
       Convenience wrapper around "install()" that tests a module, without
       installing it.  It's the equivalent to invoking "install()" with
       "target" set to "create" and "skiptest" set to 0.

       Returns true on success, false on failure.

   $bool = $self->install([ target => 'init|prepare|create|install', format =>
       FORMAT_TYPE, extractdir => DIRECTORY, fetchdir => DIRECTORY, prefer_bin
       => BOOL, force => BOOL, verbose => BOOL, ..... ]);
       Installs the current module. This includes fetching it and extracting
       it, if this hasn't been done yet, as well as creating a distribution
       object for it.

       This means you can pass it more arguments than described above, which
       will be passed on to the relevant methods as they are called.

       See "CPANPLUS::Internals::Fetch", "CPANPLUS::Internals::Extract" and
       "CPANPLUS::Dist" for details.

       Returns true on success, false on failure.

       Returns a list of module objects the Bundle specifies.

       This requires you to have extracted the bundle already, using the
       "extract()" method.

       Returns false on error.

   $text = $self->readme
       Fetches the readme belonging to this module and stores it under
       "$obj->status->readme". Returns the readme as a string on success and
       returns false on failure.

   $version = $self->installed_version()
       Returns the currently installed version of this module, if any.

   $where = $self->installed_file()
       Returns the location of the currently installed file of this module, if
       any.

   $dir = $self->installed_dir()
       Returns the directory (or more accurately, the @INC handle) from which
       this module was loaded, if any.

   $bool = $self->is_uptodate([version => VERSION_NUMBER])
       Returns a boolean indicating if this module is uptodate or not.

   $href = $self->details()
       Returns a hashref with key/value pairs offering more information about
       a particular module. For example, for "Time::HiRes" it might look like
       this:

	   Author		   Jarkko Hietaniemi (jhi@iki.fi)
	   Description		   High resolution time, sleep, and alarm
	   Development Stage	   Released
	   Installed File	   /usr/local/perl/lib/Time/Hires.pm
	   Interface Style	   plain Functions, no references used
	   Language Used	   C and perl, a C compiler will be needed
	   Package		   Time-HiRes-1.65.tar.gz
	   Public License	   Unknown
	   Support Level	   Developer
	   Version Installed	   1.52
	   Version on CPAN	   1.65

   @list = $self->contains()
       Returns a list of module objects that represent the modules also
       present in the package of this module.

       For example, for "Archive::Tar" this might return:

	   Archive::Tar
	   Archive::Tar::Constant
	   Archive::Tar::File

   @list_of_hrefs = $self->fetch_report()
       This function queries the CPAN testers database at
       http://testers.cpan.org/ for test results of specified module objects,
       module names or distributions.

       Look at CPANPLUS::Internals::Report::_query_report() for details on the
       options you can pass and the return value to expect.

   $bool = $self->uninstall([type => [all|man|prog])
       This function uninstalls the specified module object.

       You can install 2 types of files, either "man" pages or "prog"ram
       files. Alternately you can specify "all" to uninstall both (which is
       the default).

       Returns true on success and false on failure.

       Do note that this does an uninstall via the so-called ".packlist", so
       if you used a module installer like say, "ports" or "apt", you should
       not use this, but use your package manager instead.

   @modobj = $self->distributions()
       Returns a list of module objects representing all releases for this
       module on success, false on failure.

   @list = $self->files ()
       Returns a list of files used by this module, if it is installed.

   @list = $self->directory_tree ()
       Returns a list of directories used by this module.

   @list = $self->packlist ()
       Returns the "ExtUtils::Packlist" object for this module.

   @list = $self->validate ()
       Returns a list of files that are missing for this modules, but are
       present in the .packlist file.

   $bool = $self->add_to_includepath;
       Adds the current modules path to @INC and $PERL5LIB. This allows you to
       add the module from its build dir to your path.

       You can reset @INC and $PERL5LIB to its original state when you started
       the program, by calling:

	   $self->parent->flush('lib');

   $path = $self->best_path_to_module_build();
       OBSOLETE

       If a newer version of Module::Build is found in your path, it will
       return this "special" path. If the newest version of "Module::Build" is
       found in your regular @INC, the method will return false. This
       indicates you do not need to add a special directory to your @INC.

       Note that this is only relevant if you're building your own
       "CPANPLUS::Dist::*" plugin -- the built-in dist types already have this
       taken care of.
