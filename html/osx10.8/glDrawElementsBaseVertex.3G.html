NAME
       glDrawElementsBaseVertex - render primitives from array data with a
       per-element offset

C SPECIFICATION
       void glDrawElementsBaseVertex(GLenum mode, GLsizei count, GLenum type,
				     GLvoid *indices, GLint basevertex);

PARAMETERS
       mode
	   Specifies what kind of primitives to render. Symbolic constants
	   GL_POINTS, GL_LINE_STRIP, GL_LINE_LOOP, GL_LINES,
	   GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP, GL_TRIANGLE_FAN, and GL_TRIANGLES are accepted.

       count
	   Specifies the number of elements to be rendered.

       type
	   Specifies the type of the values in indices. Must be one of
	   GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT, or GL_UNSIGNED_INT.

       indices
	   Specifies a pointer to the location where the indices are stored.

       basevertex
	   Specifies a constant that should be added to each element of
	   indices when chosing elements from the enabled vertex arrays.

DESCRIPTION
       glDrawElementsBaseVertex behaves identically to glDrawElements() except
       that the ith element transferred by the corresponding draw call will be
       taken from element indices[i] + basevertex of each enabled array. If
       the resulting value is larger than the maximum value representable by
       type, it is as if the calculation were upconverted to 32-bit unsigned
       integers (with wrapping on overflow conditions). The operation is
       undefined if the sum would be negative.

NOTES
       glDrawElementsBaseVertex is only supported if the GL version is 3.2 or
       greater, or if
		   the ARB_draw_elements_base_vertex extension is supported.
	   .SH "ERRORS"


       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if mode is not an accepted value.


       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if count is negative.


       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if a geometry shader is active and
       mode is incompatible with the input primitive type of the geometry
       shader in the currently installed program object.


       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if a non-zero buffer object name is
       bound to an enabled array or the element array and the buffer object's
       data store is currently mapped.
