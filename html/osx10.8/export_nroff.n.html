       package require doctools::text

       package require doctools::nroff::man_macros

_________________________________________________________________

DESCRIPTION
       This  package  implements  the doctools table of contents export plugin
       for the generation of nroff markup.

       This is an internal package of doctools, for use by  the  higher  level
       management  packages  handling  tables  of  contents,  especially  doc-
       tools::toc::export, the export manager.

       Using it from a regular interpreter is possible, however only with con-
       tortions, and is not recommended.  The proper way to use this function-
       ality is through the package doctools::toc::export and the export  man-
       ager objects it provides.

API
       The  API  provided  by  this package satisfies the specification of the
       doctoc export plugin API version 2.

       export serial configuration
	      This command takes the canonical serialization  of  a  table  of
	      contents,  as specified in section ToC serialization format, and
	      contained in serial, the configuration, a dictionary, and gener-
	      ates  nroff  markup  encoding  the table.  The created string is
	      then returned as the result of the command.


CONFIGURATION
       The nroff export plugin recognizes the  following  configuration  vari-
       ables and changes its behaviour as they specify.

       string user
	      This  standard  configuration  variable contains the name of the
	      user running the process which invoked the export  plugin.   The
	      plugin  puts this information into the provenance comment at the
	      beginning of the generated document.

       string file
	      This standard configuration variable contains the  name  of  the
	      file  the  table of contents came from. This variable may not be
	      set or contain the empty string.	The plugin puts this  informa-
	      tion,  if  defined,  i.e. set and not the empty string, into the
	      provenance comment at the beginning of the generated document.

       boolean inline
	      If this flag is set (default) the plugin will place the  defini-
	      tions of the man macro set directly into the output.

	      If  this	flag  is not set, the plugin will place a reference to
	      the definitions of the man macro set into the  output,  but  not
	      the macro definitions themselves.

       Note that this plugin ignores the standard configuration variables for-
       mat, and map, and their values.

TOC SERIALIZATION FORMAT
       Here we specify the format used by the doctools v2 packages to  serial-
       ize  tables  of contents as immutable values for transport, comparison,
       etc.

       We distinguish between regular and canonical serializations.   While  a
       table  of  contents  may  have more than one regular serialization only
       exactly one of them will be canonical.


       regular serialization

	      [1]    The serialization of any table of contents  is  a	nested
		     Tcl dictionary.

	      [2]    This  dictionary  holds  a single key, doctools::toc, and
		     its value. This value holds the contents of the table  of
		     contents.

	      [3]    The  contents  of the table of contents are a Tcl dictio-
		     nary holding the title of the table of contents, a label,
		     and its elements. The relevant keys and their values are

		     title  The  value is a string containing the title of the
			    table of contents.

		     label  The value is a string containing a label  for  the
			    table of contents.

		     items  The  value	is  a Tcl list holding the elements of
			    the table, in the order they are to be shown.

			    Each element is a Tcl list holding the type of the
			    item,  and	its  description,  in  this  order. An
			    alternative description would be that it is a  Tcl
			    dictionary	holding  a  single key, the item type,
			    mapped to the item description.

			    The two legal item types  and  their  descriptions
			    are

			    reference
				   This  item  describes a single entry in the
				   table of  contents,	referencing  a	single
				   document.   To  this end its value is a Tcl
				   dictionary containing an id for the	refer-
				   enced  document, a label, and a longer tex-
				   tual description which  can	be  associated
				   with  the  entry.   The  relevant  keys and
				   their values are

				   id	  The value is a string containing the
					  id  of  the document associated with
					  the entry.

				   label  The value is a string  containing  a
					  label  for  this  entry. This string
					  also identifies the  entry,  and  no
					  two  entries	(references  and divi-
					  sions) in the  containing  list  are
					  allowed to have the same label.

				   desc   The  value  is a string containing a
					  longer description for this entry.

			    division
				   This item describes a group of  entries  in
				   the table of contents, inducing a hierarchy
				   of entries.	To this end its value is a Tcl
				   dictionary	containing  a  label  for  the
				   group, an optional id to a document for the
				   whole group, and the list of entries in the
				   group.  The relevant keys and their	values
				   are

				   id	  The value is a string containing the
					  id of the document  associated  with
					  the	whole	group.	 This  key  is
					  optional.

				   label  The value is a string  containing  a
					  label  for  the  group.  This string
					  also identifies the  entry,  and  no
					  two  entries	(references  and divi-
					  sions) in the  containing  list  are
					  allowed to have the same label.

				   items  The  value is a Tcl list holding the
					  elements of the group, in the  order
					  they are to be shown.  This list has
					  the same structure as the value  for
					  the  keyword	items used to describe
					  the whole  table  of	contents,  see
					  above.  This	closes	the  recusrive
					  definition of  the  structure,  with
					  divisions  holding  the same type of
					  elements as the whole table of  con-
					  tents, including other divisions.

       canonical serialization
	      The  canonical serialization of a table of contents has the for-
	      mat as specified in the previous	item,  and  then  additionally
	      satisfies  the constraints below, which make it unique among all
	      the possible serializations of this table of contents.

	      [1]    The keys found in all the	nested	Tcl  dictionaries  are
		     sorted  in  ascending  dictionary	order, as generated by
		     Tcl's builtin command lsort -increasing -dict.
