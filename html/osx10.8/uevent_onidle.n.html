DESCRIPTION
       This package provides objects which can merge multiple requestes for an
       action and execute the  action  the  moment  the  system  (event  loop)
       becomes	idle.  The  action  to be run is configured during object con-
       struction.

API
       The package exports a class, uevent::onidle, as specified below.

       ::uevent::onidle objectName commandprefix
	      The command creates a  new  onidle  object  with	an  associated
	      global  Tcl  command whose name is objectName.  This command may
	      be used to invoke various operations on the object.

	      The commandprefix is the action to perform when the  event  loop
	      is  idle and the user asked for it using the method request (See
	      below).

       The object commands created by the class commands above have the form:

       objectName request
	      This method requests the execution of the command prefix	speci-
	      fied  during  the  construction  of objectName the next time the
	      event loop is idle. Multiple requests are merged and cause  only
	      one execution of the command prefix.


EXAMPLES
       Examples  of this type of deferal are buried in the (C-level) implemen-
       tations all the Tk widgets, defering geometry calculations  and	window
       redraw activity in this manner.
