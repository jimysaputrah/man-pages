NAME
       perl5114delta - what is new for perl v5.11.4

DESCRIPTION
       This document describes differences between the 5.11.3 release and the
       5.11.4 release.

       If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.11.2, first read
       perl5113delta, which describes differences between 5.11.2 and 5.11.3.

Incompatible Changes
   Version number formats
       Acceptable version number formats have been formalized into "strict"
       and "lax" rules.  "package NAME VERSION" takes a strict version number.
       "use NAME VERSION" takes a lax version number.  "UNIVERSAL::VERSION"
       and the version object constructors take lax version numbers.
       Providing an invalid version will result in a fatal error.

       These formats will be documented fully in the version module in a
       subsequent release of Perl 5.11.  To a first approximation, a "strict"
       version number is a positive decimal number (integer or decimal-
       fraction) without exponentiation or else a dotted-decimal v-string with
       a leading 'v' character and at least three components.  A "lax" version
       number allows v-strings with fewer than three components or without a
       leading 'v'.  Under "lax" rules, both decimal and dotted-decimal
       versions may have a trailing "alpha" component separated by an
       underscore character after a fractional or dotted-decimal component.

       The version module adds "version::is_strict" and "version::is_lax"
       functions to check a scalar against these rules.

Core Enhancements
   Unicode properties
       "\p{XDigit}" now matches the same characters as "\p{Hex_Digit}".  This
       means that in addition to the characters it currently matches,
       "[A-Fa-f0-9]", it will also match their fullwidth equivalent forms, for
       example U+FF10: FULLWIDTH DIGIT ZERO.

Modules and Pragmata
   Pragmata Changes
       "less"
	   Upgraded from version 0.02 to 0.03.

	   This version introduces the "stash_name" method to allow subclasses
	   of less to pick where in %^H to store their stash.

       "version"
	   Upgraded from version 0.77 to 0.81.

	   This version adds support for "Version number formats" as described
	   earlier in this document and in its own documentation.

       "warnings"
	   Upgraded from version 1.08 to 1.09.

	   This version adds the "illegalproto" warning category.  See also
	   "New or Changed Diagnostics" for this change.

   Updated Modules
       "Archive::Extract"
	   Upgraded from version 0.36 to 0.38.

       "B::Deparse"
	   Upgraded from version 0.93 to 0.94.

       "Compress::Raw::Bzip2"
	   Upgraded from version 2.021 to 2.024.

       "Compress::Raw::Zlib"
	   Upgraded from version 2.021 to 2.024.

       "CPAN"
	   Upgraded from version 1.94_5301 to 1.94_54.

       "File::Fetch"
	   Upgraded from version 0.22 to 0.24.

       "Module::Build"
	   Upgraded from version 0.36 to 0.3603.

       "Safe"
	   Upgraded from version 2.20 to 2.21.

	   Anonymous coderefs created in Safe containers no longer get bogus
	   arguments passed to them, fixing RT #72068.

   Removed Modules and Pragmata
       "Devel::DProf::V"
	   Removed from the Perl core.	Prior version was 'undef'.

Changes to Existing Documentation
       A significant fraction of the core documentation has been updated to
       clarify the behavior of Perl's Unicode handling.

       Much of the remaining core documentation has been reviewed and edited
       for clarity, consistent use of language, and to fix the spelling of Tom
       Christiansen's name.

   Configuration improvements
       USE_ATTRIBUTES_FOR_PERLIO is now reported in the compile-time options
       listed by the "-V" switch.

   Platform Specific Changes
       VMS The default pipe buffer size on VMS has been updated to 8192 on
	   64-bit systems.

Selected Bug Fixes
       o   Tie::Hash::NamedCapture::* shouldn't abort if passed bad input (RT
	   #71828)

       o   @_ and $_ no longer leak under threads (RT #34342 and #41138, also
	   #70602, #70974)

New or Changed Diagnostics
       New warning category "illegalproto"
	   The two warnings :

	     Illegal character in prototype for %s : %s
	     Prototype after '%c' for %s : %s

	   have been moved from the "syntax" top-level warnings category into
	   a new first-level category, "illegalproto". These two warnings are
	   currently the only ones emitted during parsing of an
	   invalid/illegal prototype, so one can now do

	     no warnings 'illegalproto';

	   to suppress only those, but not other syntax-related warnings.
	   Warnings where prototypes are changed, ignored, or not met are
	   still in the "prototype" category as before. (Matt S. Trout)

       lvalue attribute ignored after the subroutine has been defined
	   This new warning is issued when one attempts to mark a subroutine
	   as lvalue after it has been defined.

Changed Internals
       o   Perl_magic_setmglob now knows about globs, fixing RT #71254.

Known Problems
       Perl 5.11.4 is a development release leading up to Perl 5.12.0.	Some
       notable known problems found in 5.11.4 are listed as dependencies of RT
       #69710, the Perl 5 version 12 meta-ticket.

Deprecations
       The following items are now deprecated.

       "UNIVERSAL->import()"
	   The method "UNIVERSAL->import()" is now deprecated.	Attempting to
	   pass import arguments to a "use UNIVERSAL" statement will result in
	   a deprecation warning. (This is a less noisy version of the full
	   deprecation warning added in 5.11.0.)

Acknowledgements
       Perl 5.11.4 represents approximately one month of development since
       Perl 5.11.3 and contains 17682 lines of changes across 318 files from
       40 authors and committers:

       Abigail, Andy Dougherty, brian d foy, Chris Williams, Craig A. Berry,
       David Golden, David Mitchell, Father Chrysostomos, Gerard Goossen,

       Christiansen, Tony Cook, Vincent Pit, and Zefram

       Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN
       modules included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN
       community for helping Perl to flourish.

Reporting Bugs
       If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles
       recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug
       database at <http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/>.  There may also be
       information at <http://www.perl.org/>, the Perl Home Page.

       If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug
       program included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a
       tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output
       of "perl -V", will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analyzed by
       the Perl porting team.

       If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
       inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please
       send it to perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed
       subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core
       committers, who be able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out
       a resolution, and help co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate
       or fix the problem across all platforms on which Perl is supported.
       Please only use this address for security issues in the Perl core, not
       for modules independently distributed on CPAN.
