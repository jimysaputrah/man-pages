NAME
       cvfsck - Check and Recover a Xsan Volume

SYNOPSIS
       cvfsck [OPTION] [FsName] [FsPath]


DESCRIPTION
       The  cvfsck program can check and repair Xsan file system metadata cor-
       ruption due to a system crash, bad disk or other catastrophic  failure.
       This program also has the ability to list all of the existing files and
       their pertinent statistics, such as inode number, size, file  type  and
       location in the volume.


       If the volume is active, it may only be checked in a Read-only mode. In
       this mode, modifications are noted, but not committed.  The  -n	option
       may be used to perform a read only check as well.

       The  file  system checking program must be run on the machine where the
       File System Services are running. cvfsck reads the  configuration  file
       and  compares the configuration against the metadata it finds. If there
       are inconsistencies in the metadata, the volume is repaired to  resolve
       these  issues.	It  is	important  that  the  configuration  file (see
       snfs_config(5)) accurately reflects the current state of the volume. If
       you  need to change a parameter in a current configuration, save a copy
       of the configuration first.

USAGE
       NOTE: If no action flags are specified (-C, -e, -f, -g, -j, -F, -K, -M,
       -p,  -r,  -s, -t, -w, -x), then cvfsck runs in a verbose read-only mode
       equivalent to -nv.


       -A     Scan directories for name collisions that would occur on a case-
	      insensitive file system.


       -a     This  option can only be used with -f and is used to tell cvfsck
	      to print totals (all).  When used, a line is printed after  each
	      storage  pool  showing  how  many free space fragments exist for
	      that storage pool.  In addition, at the end  of  the  run,  this
	      options  prints  the grand total of free space fragments for all
	      storage pools.


       -c     Provide a specific path to a configuration file that  is	to  be
	      used,  overriding  the  implicit	location.  This option is used
	      when cvupdatefs invokes cvfsck as a sub-process to  insure  that
	      the  volume meta data is consistent prior to doing a capacity or
	      bandwidth expansion.


       -C     Clobber a corrupted free inode list. No data  will  be  lost  in
	      this  process, but metadata usage may be increased after running
	      this command. Only run this  command  if	cvfsck	cannot	repair
	      free-list inconsistencies.


       -d     Internal	debug  use.  This option dumps a significant amount of
	      data to the standard output device.


       -e     Report statistics for extents  in  each  file.   This  reporting
	      option  enables  all  the  same file statistics that the -r flag
	      enables. In addition, the -e flag  enables  statistic  reporting
	      for  each extent in a file. All extent data is displayed immedi-
	      ately following the parent file's information. See the  -r  flag
	      description  for	file  statistics  output. The extent stats are
	      output in the following order; Extent#, Stripe group, File rela-
	      tive block, Base block, End block No checking is done. This flag
	      implies -r and -n flags.


       -f     Report free space fragmentation.	Each separate  chunk  of  free
	      allocation  blocks  is tallied based on the chunk's size.  After
	      all free chunks are accounted for, a report is displayed showing
	      the  counts  for	each unique sized free space chunk. Free space
	      fragmentation is reported separately for each storage pool.  The
	      free  space report is sorted from smallest contiguous allocation
	      chunk to largest. The "Pct." column indicates percentage of  the
	      storage  pool  space the given sized chunks make up. The "(sum)"
	      column indicates what percentage of the total storage pool space
	      is taken up by chunks smaller than, and equal to the given size.
	      The "Chunk Size" gives the chunk's size in  volume  blocks,  and
	      the  "Chunk  Count"  column  displays how many instances of this
	      sized chunk are located in this storage pool's free space.   For
	      more  information  on  fragmentation see the snfsdefrag(1) page.
	      No checking is done. Implies -n flag.  See also -a that is  used
	      to get more output.


       -g     Print  journal recovery log.  With this flag cvfsck reports con-
	      tents of the metadata journal. For debugging use only.   Implies
	      -n flag.


       -j     Execute journal recovery and then exit. Running journal recovery
	      will ensure all operations have been committed to disk, and that
	      the  metadata state is up to date. It is recommended that cvfsck
	      is run with the -j flag before any read-only  checks  or	volume
	      reports are run.


       -J     Dump  raw  journal to a file named jrnraw.dat and then exit. For
	      debugging use only.


       -K     Forces the journal to be cleared and reset.  WARNING:  Resetting
	      the  journal  may  introduce  metadata  inconsistency. After the
	      journal reset has been  completed,  run  cvfsck  to  verify  and
	      repair  any metadata inconsistency. Use this option with extreme
	      caution.


       -l     This option will log any problems to the system  log.   This  is
	      mainly  used  on system startup where a file system check may be
	      automatically started by the Xsan File System Services.


       -L     Reassigns the FOUND (orphaned) files to another  directory.  The
	      argument	which  accompanies  the -L flag is the inode number of
	      the directory which should receive any  FOUND  files.  The  Xsan
	      inode  is a 64-bit value. On some platforms stat operations will
	      only return 32-bit values. If you are unsure, the 'dc  pathname'
	      command  can  be used in cvfsdb to find the 64-bit inode number.
	      If the argument does not point to a valid directory cvfsck  will
	      exit  with  an  error.  If the -L flag is not given, FOUND files
	      will be placed in the root of the Xsan file system.


       -M     Performs simple checks that attempt to determine whether	a  new
	      metadata	dump  is  needed.   If	the checks find that a dump is
	      needed, cvfsck will exit with status 1 and print an explanation.
	      If  the  checks  do  not find that a dump is needed, cvfsck will
	      exit with status 0.  If an error	occurs	while  performing  the
	      checks, cvfsck will print an explanation and exit with status 2.
	      This option is useful only on managed file systems.  Note: these
	      checks  are not exhaustive, and, in some cases, cvfsck will exit
	      with status 0 when a new dump is actually required.


       -n     This option allows a volume to be checked in a  read-only  mode.
	      The modifications that would have happened are described but are
	      not actually performed. A read-only  volume  check  may  display
	      errors if there are journaled volume transactions which have not
	      yet been committed. It is recommended that cvfsck  is  run  with
	      the -j flag before a read-only check is run.


       -p     This  option  provides a method for deleting all files that have
	      blocks allocated on the given stripe group. All files that  have
	      at  least  one  data  extent  on	the given stripe group will be
	      deleted, even if they have extents on  other  stripe  groups  as
	      well.   WARNING:	Use  this  option  with  extreme caution. This
	      option could remove files  that  the  user  did  not  intend  to
	      remove, and there are no methods to recover files that have been
	      deleted with this option.


       -r     This report option shows information on file state.  Information
	      for  each  file is output in the following order.  Inode#, Mode,
	      Size, Block count, Extent count, Storage pools, Affinity, Path


       -s     THIS FUNCTIONALITY ONLY SUPPORTED ON MANAGED FILE  SYSTEMS  Pro-
	      vides  a	method	for  restoring data on the given storage pool.
	      After cvfsck completes in this mode all files on the given stor-
	      age  pool will be set to TAPE ONLY. All data blocks on the given
	      storage pool will be gone and subsequent access  of  these  file
	      will trigger a retrieve from tape.

	      NOTE: Running this command may result in data loss.


       -t     Report  files  that  trespass on the restricted areas of storage
	      pools.  Space for these files may have been mistakenly allocated
	      in  these  areas	by  previous  releases	of  Xsan, and any file
	      reported should be moved.  No other checking is done.


       -T     When this option is given with a directory name (-T &ltdirectory&gt)
	      all  temporary  files  created  by cvfsck will be placed in that
	      directory. If this argument is omitted all temporary files  will
	      be placed in the system's default temporary folder. NOTE: cvfsck
	      does honor the use of TMPDIR/TEMP environment variables.


       -v     Use verbose reporting methods.


       -w     This option specifies that cvfsck is allowed to  make  modifica-
	      tions to the file system to correct any problems that are found.


       -x     Report statistics for input to a spread sheet.  No  checking  is
	      done.  Implies  -e,-r  and -n flags.  All values are in decimal.
	      Data is comma separated and in this order: Inode#,  Mode,  Size,
	      Block  Count, Affinity, Path, Extent Count, Extent Number, Stor-
	      age pool, File Relative Block, Base, End, Depth, Breadth


       -X     (Engineering use only.) Free all inodes  in  extended  attribute
	      chains.  Extended  attributes  present  in  these inodes will be
	      deleted.


       &ltFsName&gt
	      Specifies a volume to check. Otherwise all volumes on this  sys-
	      tem will be displayed for selection.


       &ltFsPath&gt
	      Forces	the   program	to   use   a   location   other   than
	      /Library/Logs/Xsan/data to locate the volumes.

EXIT VALUES
       cvfsck will return one of the following condition codes upon exit.

	      0 - No error, no changes made to the file system
	      1 - Inconsistencies encountered, changes have been
		  made to the file system
	       - A read-only cvfsck will return 1 if journal replay is needed.
	       - A read-only cvfsck will only print the needed fixes and not
		 commit changes to the metadata.
	      2 - Fatal error, cvfsck run aborted
	      3 - Name collisions found, no repair needed
	      4 - Name collisions found, file system successfully repaired


NOTES
       It is strongly recommended that cvfsck be run first in  read-only  mode
       to  show  the  extent  of any metadata corruption before attempting any
       changes.

       Unless running cvfsck in read-only mode,  the  file  system  should  be
       unmounted  from all machines before a check is performed.  In the event
       that repairs are required and cvfsck modifies metadata, it will	report
       this  at  the end of the check.	If this occurs, any machines that con-
       tinue to mount the file system should be rebooted before restarting the
       file system.

       In order to ensure minimum run-time cvfsck should be run on an idle FSS
       server. Extraneous I/O and processor usage  will  severely  impact  the
       performance of cvfsck.

       CRC  checks  are now done on all Windows Security descriptors.  Windows
       Security  Descriptors  with  inconsistent  CRC's  are  removed  causing
       affected files to inherit permissions from the parent folder.

       NOTE:  On  large  file systems cvfsck may requires 100s of megabytes or
       more of local system disk space for working files.
