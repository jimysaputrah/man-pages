     asr help | version

DESCRIPTION
     asr efficiently copies disk images onto volumes, either directly or via a
     multicast network stream.	asr can also accurately clone volumes without
     the use of an intermediate disk image.

     In its first form, asr copies source (usually a disk image, potentially
     on an HTTP server) to target.  source can be specified using a path in
     the filesystem, or an http or https URL.  It can also be an asr:// URL to
     indicate a multicast source.  asr can also be invoked with its second
     form to act as a multicast server.  In its third form, asr will restore a
     multicast disk image to a file instead of disk volume.  In its fourth
     form, asr prepares a disk image to be restored efficiently, adding whole-
     volume checksum information.  help and version provide usage and version
     information, respectively.

     source and target can be /dev entries or volume mountpoints.  If restor-
     ing a multicast disk image to a file, file can be a path to a local file
     or directory. If the specified path is a file, the disk image is given
     the specified name. If a directory, the name of the disk image being mul-
     ticast is used. When specifying server, source has to be a UDIF disk
     image. Restoring from a multicast stream is accomplished by passing a
     asr:// url as source.

     When run in its first form above, the --erase option must always be used,
     as asr no longer supports file copying.  Such functionality is done bet-
     ter by ditto(1).

     asr needs to be run as root (see sudo(8)) in order to accomplish its
     tasks.

VERBS
     Each verb is listed with its description and individual arguments.

     restore	restores a disk image or volume to another volume (including a
		mounted disk image)

		--source       can be a disk image, /dev entry, or volume
			       mountpoint. In the latter two cases, the volume
			       must be unmountable or mounted read-only in
			       order for a erase blockcopy to occur (thus, one
			       cannot erase blockcopy the root filesystem as
			       the source, unless it happened to be mounted
			       read-only).

		--target       can be a /dev entry, or volume mountpoint. Must
			       be unmountable in order for an erase block-copy
			       to occur.

		--file	       when performing a multicast restore, --file can
			       be specified instead of --target. If the speci-
			       fied path is a file, the disk image is given
			       the specified name. If a directory, the name of
			       the disk image being multicast is used.

		--erase        erases target and is required.  --erase must
			       always be used, as file copies are no longer
			       supported by asr.  If source is a asr:// url
			       for restoring from a multicast stream, --erase
			       must be passed (multicasting only supports
			       erase block-copy restores).  Passing --erase
			       with --file indicates any existing file should
			       be overwritten when doing a multicast file
			       copy.

		--format HFS+ | HFSX
			       specifies the destination filesystem format,
			       when --erase is also given. If not specified,
			       the destination will be formatted with the same
			       filesystem format as the source. If multicast-
			       ing, the --format specified must be block copy
			       compatible with the source.  --format is
			       ignored if --erase is not used. Note: HFS Jour-
			       naling is an attribute of the source image, and
			       is not affected by --format.

		--noprompt     suppresses the prompt which usually occurs
			       before target is erased.  newfs_hfs(8) will be
			       called on target and once you start writing new
			       data, there isn't much hope for recovery.  You
			       have been warned.

		--timeout num  specifies num seconds that a multicast client
			       should wait when no payload data has been
			       received over a multicast stream before exit-
			       ing, allowing the client to stop in case of
			       server failure/stoppage.  It defaults to 0
			       (e.g. never time out).

		--puppetstrings
			       provide progress output that is easy for
			       another program to parse.  Any program trying
			       to interpret asr's progress should use
			       --puppetstrings.

		--noverify     skips the verification steps normally taken to
			       ensure that a volume has been properly
			       restored.  --noverify allows images which have
			       not been scanned to be restored.  Skipping ver-
			       ification is dangerous for a number of reasons
			       and should never be used in production systems.

		--allowfragmentedcatalog
			       allows restores to proceed even if the source's
			       catalog file is fragmented (in particular, if
			       it has more than 8 extents).  By default such
			       restores are disallowed.  Catalog fragmentation
			       is undesirable and in most cases it is better
			       to fix the problem on the source (e.g. by run-
			       ning fsck_hfs -r on it), but
			       --allowfragmentedcatalog is provided for situa-
			       tions where such a change is impractical.

     server	multicasts source over the network. Requires --erase be passed
		in by clients (multicasting only supports erase block-copy
		restores).

		--source   source has to be a UDIF disk image. A path to a
			   disk image on a local/remote volume can be passed
			   in, or a http:// url to a disk image that is acces-
			   sible via a web server.

		--interface
			   the network interface to be used for multicasting
			   (e.g. en0) instead of the default network inter-
			   face.

		--config   server requires a configuration file to be passed,
			   in standard property list format.  The following
			   keys/options configure the various parameters for
			   multicast operation.

		Required

		Data Rate	       this is the desired data rate in bytes
				       per second.  On average, the stream
				       will go slightly slower than this
				       speed, but will never exceed it.  It's
				       a number in the plist (-int when set
				       with defaults(1)).

				       Note: The performance/reliability of
				       the networking infrastructure being
				       multicast on is an important factor in
				       determining what data rate can be sup-
				       ported. Excessive/bursty packet loss
				       for a given data rate could be due to
				       an inability of the server/client to be
				       able to send/receive multicast data at
				       that rate, but it's equally important
				       to verify that the network infrastruc-
				       ture can support multicasting at the
				       requested rate.

		Multicast Address      this is the Multicast address for the
				       data stream. It's a string in the
				       plist.

		Optional

		Client Data Rate       this is the rate the slowest client can
				       write data to its target in bytes per
				       second.	if asr misses data on the
				       first pass (x's during progress) and
				       slowing the Data Rate doesn't resolve
				       it, setting the Client Data Rate will
				       dynamically regulate the speed of the
				       multicast stream to allow clients more
				       time to write the data. It's a number
				       in the plist (-int when set with
				       defaults(1)).

		DNS Service Discovery  whether the server should be advertised
				       via DNS Service Discovery, a.k.a. Bon-
				       jour (tm).  It defaults to true.  It's
				       a boolean in the plist (-bool when set
				       with defaults(1)).

		Loop Suspend	       a limit of the number of times to mul-
				       ticast the image file when no clients
				       have started a restore operation. Once
				       exceeded, the server will stop the
				       stream and wait for new clients before
				       multicasting the image file. It
				       defaults to 0 (e.g. never stop multi-
				       casting once a client starts the
				       stream), and should not be set to &lt2.
				       It's a number in the plist (-int when
				       set with defaults(1)).

		Multicast TTL	       the time to live on the multicast pack-
				       ets (for multicasting through routers).
				       It defaults to 3.  It cannot be set to
				       0, and should not be set to 1 (other-
				       wise, it could adversely affect some
				       network routers).  It's a number in the
				       plist (-int when set with defaults(1)).

		Port		       the port of initial client-server hand-
				       shake, version checks, multicast
				       restore metadata, and stream data.  It
				       defaults to 7800.  This should only be
				       included/modified if the default port
				       cannot be used.	It's a number in the
				       plist (-int when set with defaults(1)).

     imagescan	calculate checksums of the data in the provided image and
		store them in the image.  These checksums are used to ensure
		proper restores.  Also determines if the disk image is in
		order for multicasting, and rewrites the file in order if not.
		If the image has to be reordered, it will require free disk
		space equal to the size of the disk image being scanned.

		--nostream
			  bypasses the check/reordering of a disk image file
			  for multicasting. By default disk images will be
			  rewritten in a way that's necessary for multicast-
			  ing.

		--allowfragmentedcatalog
			  bypasses the check for a fragmented catalog file.
			  By default that check is done and scanning won't be
			  allowed on an image that has a fragmented catalog
			  file.  It is usually a better idea to fix the image
			  (e.g. run fsck_hfs -r on a writable copy of it) than
			  to use --allowfragmentedcatalog, but it is provided
			  in case fixing the image is impractical.

BUFFERING
     The following options control how asr uses memory.  These options can
     have a significant impact on performance.	asr is optimized for copying
     between devices (different disk drives, from a network volume to a local
     disk, etc).  As such, asr defaults to using eight one megabyte buffers.
     These buffers are wired down (occupying physical memory).	For partition
     to partition copies on the same device, one large buffer (e.g. 32 MB) is
     much faster than the default eight medium sized ones. For multicast, 4
     256k buffers are the default.  Custom buffering for multicast operation
     is not recommended.

     --csumbuffers and --csumbuffersize allow a different buffer configuration
     for checksumming operations.  One checksum buffer offers the best perfor-
     mance.  The default is 1 1MB buffer. Custom checksum buffering is not
     recommended.

     Like mkfile(8), size defaults to bytes but can be followed by a multi-
     plier character (e.g. 'm').

     --buffers num
		 specifies that num buffers should be used.

     --buffersize size
		 specifies the size of each buffer.

     --csumbuffers num
		 specifies that num buffers should be used for checksumming
		 operations (which only affect the target).  Custom checksum
		 buffering is not recommended.

     --csumbuffersize size
		 specifies the size of each buffer used for checksumming.
		 Custom checksum buffering is not recommended.

OTHER OPTIONS
     --verbose	 enables verbose progress and error messages.
     --debug	 enables other progress and error messages.

EXAMPLES
     Volume cloning:
	   sudo asr restore --source /Volumes/Classic --target
	   /Volumes/install --erase

     Restoring:
	   sudo asr restore -s &ltcompressedimage&gt -t &lttargetvol&gt --erase

     Will erase the target and potentially do a block copy restore.

     Multicast server:
	   asr server --source &ltcompressedimage&gt --config
	   &ltconfiguration.plist&gt

     Will start up a multicast server for the specified image, using the
     parameters in the configuration.plist. The image will not start multicas-
     ting on the network until a client attempts to start a restore. The
     server will continue to multicast the image until the process is termi-
     nated.

     An example multicast configuration file:
	   defaults write /tmp/streamconfig "Data Rate" -int 6000000
	   defaults write /tmp/streamconfig "Multicast Address" &ltmcastaddr&gt
	   (will create the file /tmp/streamconfig.plist)
	   &ltmcastaddr&gt should be appropriate for your network infrastructure
	   and policy, usually from a range assigned by your network
	   administrator.

     Multicast client
	   sudo asr restore --source asr://&lthostname&gt --target &lttargetvol&gt
	   --erase

     Multicast client restoring to a file
	   sudo asr restore --source asr://&lthostname&gt --file &ltfile&gt --erase
     Will receive the multicast stream from &lthostname&gt and save it to a file.
     If &ltfile&gt is a directory, the image of the streamed disk image will be
     used the save the file. --erase causes any existing file with the same
     name to be overwritten.

HOW TO USE ASR
     asr requires a properly created disk image for most efficient operation.
     This image is most easily made with the Disk Utility application's "Image
     from Folder" function in OS X 10.3.  The Disk Copy from OS X 10.2.3
     (v55.6) or later can also be used.

     Basic steps for imaging and restoring a volume:

     1.   Set up the source volume the way you want it.

     2.   Use Disk Utility's "Images -&gt New -&gt Image from Folder..." function
	  and select the root of the volume.  Save the image as read-only or
	  compressed.  "Images-&gtNew-&gtImage from &ltdevice&gt" is not recommended
	  on 10.3.x.

     3.   Scan the image with "Images -&gt Scan Image for Restore."

     4.   Select an image or volume and click on the "Restore" tab.  Drag the
	  source image and destination partition to the source and destination
	  fields.  Click Restore.

BLOCK COPY RESTORE REQUIRMENTS
     asr can block copy restore HFS+/HFSX filesystems and resize the source
     filesystem to fit in the target's partition if the source filesystem data
     blocks will fit within the target partition's space (resizing the
     filesystem geometry as appropriate).

     HFS+ can be used as the source of a block copy to either an HFS+ or HFSX
     destination.  However, an HFSX source can only be used to block copy to
     an HFSX destination.  This is because case collision of file names could
     occur when converting from an HFSX filesystem to HFS+.

     Certain non-HFS+/HFSX filesystems will block copy restore, but the target
     partition will be resized to match the size of the source image/partition
     size, with no filesystem resizing occurring.

COMPATIBILITY
     asr maintains compatibility with previous syntax, e.g.

     asr -source source -target target [options]
     asr -source source -server configuration [options]
     asr -source asr://source -file file [options]
     asr -imagescan [options] image
     asr -h | -v

     where -source, -target, and -file are equivalent to --source, --target,
     and --file respectively, and all [options] are equivalent to their --
     descriptions.  asr -server configuration is superseded by asr server
     --config configuration.  The following deprecated options also remain:

     -nocheck	this option is deprecated, but remains for script compatibil-
		ity.  Use -noverify instead.

     -blockonly
		this option is deprecated, but remains for script compatibil-
		ity. On by default.  Note that if an image scanned with
		-blockonly cannot be block-copied to a particular target an
		error will occur, since the file-copy information was omitted.

     Note: Compatibility with previous syntax is not guaranteed in the next
     major OS release.

ERRORS
     asr will exit with status 1 if it cannot complete the requested opera-
     tion.  A human readable error message will be printed in most cases.  If
     asr has already started writing to the target volume when the error
     occurs, then it will erase the target, leaving it in a valid (but empty)
     state.  It will, however, leave it unmounted.

     Some of the error messages which asr prints are generated by the underly-
     ing subsystems that it uses, and their meaning is not always obvious.
     Here are some useful guidelines:

     1.   asr does some preflight testing before it starts actually copying
	  data.  Errors that show up during this preflighting are usually
	  clear (e.g. "There is not enough space in volume "Macintosh HD" to
	  do the restore.")

     2.   If an error occurs during the copy, it might be because there is
	  corruption in the source image file.	Try running "hdiutil verify"
	  with the image.  A common error message which indicates this is
	  "codec overrun".

     3.   Errors which occur during the copy and which don't have an obvious
	  cause (i.e. the error message is difficult to interpret) may be
	  transient in nature (e.g. there was an I/O error on the disk), and
	  it is worth simply trying the restore again.

HISTORY
     Apple Software Restore got its start as a field service restoration tool
     used to reconfigure computers' software to 'factory' state.  It later
     became a more general software restore mechanism and software installa-
     tion helper application for various Apple computer products.  ASR has
     been used in manufacturing processes and in shipping computers' System
     Software Installers.

     For Mac OS X, asr was rewritten as a command line tool for manufacturing
     and professional customers.  asr is the backend for the Mac OS X Software
     Restore application that shipped on Macintosh computers as well as the
     Scan and Restore functionality in Disk Utility.

     Multicast support was added to allow multiple clients to erase restore an
     image from a multicast network stream.

     Per its history, most functionality in asr is limited to HFS+ volumes.
