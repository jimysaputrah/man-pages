NAME
       Package::Stash::XS - faster and more correct implementation of the
       Package::Stash API

VERSION
       version 0.25

SYNOPSIS
	 use Package::Stash;

DESCRIPTION
       This is a backend for Package::Stash, which provides the functionality
       in a way that's less buggy and much faster. It will be used by default
       if it's installed, and should be preferred in all environments with a
       compiler.

BUGS
       No known bugs (but see the BUGS section in Package::Stash).
