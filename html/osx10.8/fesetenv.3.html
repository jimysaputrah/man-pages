FEGETENV(3)		 BSD Library Functions Manual		   FEGETENV(3)

NAME
     fegetenv, feholdexcept, fesetenv, feupdateenv -- functions providing
     access to the floating-point environment.

SYNOPSIS
     #include &ltfenv.h&gt
     #pragma STDC FENV_ACCESS ON

     int
     fegetenv(fenv_t *envp);

     int
     feholdexcept(fenvt_t *envp);

     int
     fesetenv(fenv_t *envp);

     int
     feupdateenv(fenv_t *envp);

DESCRIPTION
     These functions provide the means to manage the entire floating-point
     environment--including both status flags and control modes--as a single
     entity.

     The fegetenv() function attempts to store the current floating-point
     environment in the object pointed to by envp.  It returns zero if the
     environment was successfully stored, and a nonzero value otherwise.

     The feholdexcept() function saves the current floating-point environment
     in the object pointed to by envp, clears the floating-point status flags,
     and then installs a "non-stop" mode, if available, under which no traps
     are taken for floating-point exceptions (as is the case in default
     IEEE-754 floating-point execution).  It returns zero if and only if such
     a mode was successfully installed.

     The fesetenv() function attempts to establish the floating-point environ-
     ment represented by the object pointed to by envp.  This object shall
     have been set by a call to fegetenv() or feholdexcept(), or be equal to a
     floating-point environment macro defined in &ltfenv.h&gt.  Note that this
     function merely installs the floating-point status flags represented by
     its argument, and does not raise the corresponding floating-point excep-
     tions.  It returns zero if and only if the environment pointed to by envp
     was successfully installed.

     The feupdateenv() function attempts to save the currently raised float-
     ing-point flags, install the floating-point environment represented by
     *envp, and then raise the floating-point exceptions corresponding to the
     saved flags.  The object pointed to by envp shall have been set by a call
     to fegetenv() or feholdexcept(), or be equal to a floating-point environ-
     ment macro defined in &ltfenv.h&gt.  It returns zero if and only if all of
     the specified actions were successfully carried out.
