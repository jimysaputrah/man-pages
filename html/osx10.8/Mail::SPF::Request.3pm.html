DESCRIPTION
       An object of class Mail::SPF::Request represents an SPF request.

   Constructors
       The following constructors are provided:

       new(%options): returns Mail::SPF::Request
	   Creates a new SPF request object.  The request is considered the
	   root-request for any subsequent sub-requests (see the
	   "new_sub_request" constructor).

	   %options is a list of key/value pairs representing any of the
	   following options:

	   versions
	       A reference to an array of integers listing the versions of SPF
	       records that may be used for the SPF check.  Only those record
	       versions that cover the desired scope will actually be used.
	       At least one applicable version must be specified.  For a
	       single record version, a simple scalar may be specified instead
	       of an array-ref.  Defaults to all versions that cover the
	       desired scope (see below); defaults to [1, 2] for the default
	       scope of 'mfrom'.

	       The following versions are supported:

	       1   Use "v=spf1" records.

	       2   Use "spf2.0" records.

	       Example:  A value of 1 (or [1]) means that only "v=spf1"
	       records should be used for the SPF check.  If at the same time
	       a scope of 'pra' is specified, a Mail::SPF::EInvalidScope
	       exception will be thrown as "v=spf1" records do not cover the
	       PRA scope.

	   scope
	       A string denoting the authorization scope of the identity that
	       should be checked.  Defaults to 'mfrom'.  The following scope
	       values are supported:

	       'helo'
		   The given identity is the "HELO" parameter of an SMTP
		   transaction (RFC 2821) and should be checked against SPF
		   records that cover the "helo" scope ("v=spf1").  See the
		   SPFv1 specification (RFC 4408) for the formal definition of
		   the "HELO" scope.

	       'mfrom'
		   The given identity is the "MAIL FROM" parameter of an SMTP
		   transaction (RFC 2821), and should be checked against SPF
		   records that cover the "mfrom" scope ("v=spf1" and
		   "spf2.0/mfrom").  See the SPFv1 specification (RFC 4408)
		   for the formal definition of the "MAIL FROM" scope.

		   Note:  In the case of an empty "MAIL FROM" SMTP transaction
		   parameter ("MAIL FROM:&lt&gt"), you should perform a check with
		   the "helo" scope instead.

	       'pra'
		   The given identity is the "Purported Responsible Address"
		   of an internet message (RFC 2822) and should be checked
		   against SPF records that cover the "pra" scope
		   ("spf2.0/pra").  See the PRA specification (RFC 4407) for
		   the formal definition of the PRA scope.

	   authority_domain
	       A string denoting the domain name that should be queried for
	       sender policy records.  Defaults to the domain of the
	       "identity" option.  There is usually no need to specify the
	       "authority_domain" option.

	   identity
	       Required.  A string denoting the sender identity whose
	       authorization should be checked.  This is a domain name for the
	       "helo" scope, and an e-mail address for the "mfrom" and "pra"
	       scopes.

	       Note:  An empty identity must not be passed.  In the case of an
	       empty "MAIL FROM" SMTP transaction parameter, you should
	       perform a check with the "helo" scope instead.

	   ip_address
	       Required for checks with the "helo", "mfrom", and "pra" scopes.
	       Either a string or a NetAddr::IP object denoting the IP address
	       of the host claiming the identity that is being checked.  Can
	       be either an IPv4 or an IPv6 address.  An IPv4-mapped IPv6
	       address (e.g. '::ffff:192.168.0.1') is treated as an IPv4
	       address.

	   helo_identity
	       A string denoting the "HELO" SMTP transaction parameter in the
	       case that the main identity is of a scope other than "helo".
	       This identity is then used merely for the expansion of "%{h}"
	       macros during the policy evaluation of the main identity.
	       Defaults to undef, which will be expanded to 'unknown'.	If the
	       main identity is of the "helo" scope, this option is unused.

       new_sub_request(%options): returns Mail::SPF::Request
	   Must be invoked on an existing request object.  Creates a new sub-
	   request object by cloning the invoked request, which is then
	   considered the new request's super-request.	Any specified options
	   (see the "new" constructor) override the parameters of the super-
	   request.  There is usually no need to specify any options besides
	   the "authority_domain" option.

   Instance methods
       The following instance methods are provided:

       root_request: returns Mail::SPF::Request
	   Returns the root of the request's chain of super-requests.
	   Specifically, returns the request itself if it has no super-
	   requests.

       super_request: returns Mail::SPF::Request
	   Returns the super-request of the request, or undef if there is
	   none.

       versions: returns list of string
	   Returns a list of the SPF record versions that are used for
	   request.  See the description of the "new" constructor's "versions"
	   option.

       scope: returns string
	   Returns the scope of the request.  See the description of the "new"
	   constructor's "scope" option.

       authority_domain: returns string
	   Returns the authority domain of the request.  See the description
	   of the "new" constructor's "authority_domain" option.

       identity: returns string
	   Returns the identity of the request.  See the description of the
	   "new" constructor's "identity" option.

       domain: returns string
	   Returns the identity domain of the request.	See the description of
	   the "new" constructor's "identity" option.

       localpart: returns string
	   Returns the identity localpart of the request.  See the description
	   of the "new" constructor's "identity" option.

       ip_address: returns NetAddr::IP
	   Returns the IP address of the request as a NetAddr::IP object.  See
	   the description of the "new" constructor's "ip_address" option.

       ip_address_v6: returns NetAddr::IP
	   Like the "ip_address" method, however, an IPv4 address is returned
	   as an IPv4-mapped IPv6 address (e.g. '::ffff:192.168.0.1') to
	   facilitate uniform processing.

       helo_identity: returns string
	   Returns the "HELO" SMTP transaction parameter of the request.  See
	   the description of the "new" constructor's "helo_identity" option.

       record: returns Mail::SPF::Record
	   Returns the SPF record selected during the processing of the
	   request, or undef if there is none.

       state($field): returns anything
       state($field, $value): returns anything
	   Provides an interface for storing temporary state information with
	   the request object.	This is primarily meant to be used internally
	   by Mail::SPF::Server and other Mail::SPF classes.

	   If $value is specified, stores it in a state field named $field.
	   Returns the current (new) value of the state field named $field.
	   This method may be used as an lvalue.
