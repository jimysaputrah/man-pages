NAME
       Log::Message::Item  - Message objects for Log::Message

SYNOPSIS
	   # Implicitly used by Log::Message to create Log::Message::Item objects

	   print "this is the message's id: ",	   $item-&gtid;

	   print "this is the message stored: ",   $item-&gtmessage;

	   print "this is when it happened: ",	   $item-&gtwhen;

	   print "the message was tagged: ",	   $item-&gttag;

	   print "this was the severity level: ",  $item-&gtlevel;

	   $item-&gtremove;  # delete the item from the stack it was on

	   # Besides these methods, you can also call the handlers on
	   # the object specificallly.
	   # See the Log::Message::Handlers manpage for documentation on what
	   # handlers are available by default and how to add your own

DESCRIPTION
       Log::Message::Item is a class that generates generic Log items.	These
       items are stored on a Log::Message stack, so see the Log::Message
       manpage about details how to retrieve them.

       You should probably not create new items by yourself, but use the
       storing mechanism provided by Log::Message.

       However, the accessors and handlers are of interest if you want to do
       fine tuning of how your messages are handled.

       The accessors and methods are described below, the handlers are
       documented in the Log::Message::Handlers manpage.

Methods and Accessors
   remove
       Calling remove will remove the object from the stack it was on, so it
       will not show up any more in subsequent fetches of messages.

       You can still call accessors and handlers on it however, to handle it
       as you will.

   id
       Returns the internal ID of the item. This may be useful for comparing
       since the ID is incremented each time a new item is created.
       Therefore, an item with ID 4 must have been logged before an item with
       ID 9.

   when
       Returns the timestamp of when the message was logged

   message
       The actual message that was stored

   level
       The severity type of this message, as well as the name of the handler
       that was called upon storing it.

   tag
       Returns the identification tag that was put on the message.

   shortmess
       Returns the equivalent of a "Carp::shortmess" for this item.  See the
       "Carp" manpage for details.

   longmess
       Returns the equivalent of a "Carp::longmess" for this item, which is
       essentially a stack trace.  See the "Carp" manpage for details.

   parent
       Returns a reference to the Log::Message object that stored this item.
       This is useful if you want to have access to the full stack in a
       handler.
