NAME
       Moose::Meta::Attribute - The Moose attribute metaclass

VERSION
       version 2.0205

DESCRIPTION
       This class is a subclass of Class::MOP::Attribute that provides
       additional Moose-specific functionality.

       To really understand this class, you will need to start with the
       Class::MOP::Attribute documentation. This class can be understood as a
       set of additional features on top of the basic feature provided by that
       parent class.

INHERITANCE
       "Moose::Meta::Attribute" is a subclass of Class::MOP::Attribute.

METHODS
       Many of the documented below override methods in Class::MOP::Attribute
       and add Moose specific features.

   Creation
       Moose::Meta::Attribute->new(%options)
	   This method overrides the Class::MOP::Attribute constructor.

	   Many of the options below are described in more detail in the
	   Moose::Manual::Attributes document.

	   It adds the following options to the constructor:

	   o	   is => 'ro', 'rw', 'bare'

		   This provides a shorthand for specifying the "reader",
		   "writer", or "accessor" names. If the attribute is read-
		   only ('ro') then it will have a "reader" method with the
		   same attribute as the name.

		   If it is read-write ('rw') then it will have an "accessor"
		   method with the same name. If you provide an explicit
		   "writer" for a read-write attribute, then you will have a
		   "reader" with the same name as the attribute, and a
		   "writer" with the name you provided.

		   Use 'bare' when you are deliberately not installing any
		   methods (accessor, reader, etc.) associated with this
		   attribute; otherwise, Moose will issue a deprecation
		   warning when this attribute is added to a metaclass.

	   o	   isa => $type

		   This option accepts a type. The type can be a string, which
		   should be a type name. If the type name is unknown, it is
		   assumed to be a class name.

		   This option can also accept a Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint
		   object.

		   If you also provide a "does" option, then your "isa" option
		   must be a class name, and that class must do the role
		   specified with "does".

	   o	   does => $role

		   This is short-hand for saying that the attribute's type
		   must be an object which does the named role.

	   o	   coerce => $bool

		   This option is only valid for objects with a type
		   constraint ("isa") that defined a coercion. If this is
		   true, then coercions will be applied whenever this
		   attribute is set.

		   You can make both this and the "weak_ref" option true.

	   o	   trigger => $sub

		   This option accepts a subroutine reference, which will be
		   called after the attribute is set.

	   o	   required => $bool

		   An attribute which is required must be provided to the
		   constructor. An attribute which is required can also have a
		   "default" or "builder", which will satisfy its required-
		   ness.

		   A required attribute must have a "default", "builder" or a
		   non-"undef" "init_arg"

	   o	   lazy => $bool

		   A lazy attribute must have a "default" or "builder". When
		   an attribute is lazy, the default value will not be
		   calculated until the attribute is read.

	   o	   weak_ref => $bool

		   If this is true, the attribute's value will be stored as a
		   weak reference.

	   o	   auto_deref => $bool

		   If this is true, then the reader will dereference the value
		   when it is called. The attribute must have a type
		   constraint which defines the attribute as an array or hash
		   reference.

	   o	   lazy_build => $bool

		   Setting this to true makes the attribute lazy and provides
		   a number of default methods.

		     has 'size' => (
			 is	    => 'ro',
			 lazy_build => 1,
		     );

		   is equivalent to this:

		     has 'size' => (
			 is	   => 'ro',
			 lazy	   => 1,
			 builder   => '_build_size',
			 clearer   => 'clear_size',
			 predicate => 'has_size',
		     );

		   If your attribute name starts with an underscore ("_"),
		   then the clearer and predicate will as well:

		     has '_size' => (
			 is	    => 'ro',
			 lazy_build => 1,
		     );

		   becomes:

		     has '_size' => (
			 is	   => 'ro',
			 lazy	   => 1,
			 builder   => '_build__size',
			 clearer   => '_clear_size',
			 predicate => '_has_size',
		     );

		   Note the doubled underscore in the builder name.
		   Internally, Moose simply prepends the attribute name with
		   "_build_" to come up with the builder name.

	   o	   documentation

		   An arbitrary string that can be retrieved later by calling
		   "$attr->documentation".

       $attr->clone(%options)
	   This creates a new attribute based on attribute being cloned. You
	   must supply a "name" option to provide a new name for the
	   attribute.

	   The %options can only specify options handled by
	   Class::MOP::Attribute.

   Value management
       $attr->initialize_instance_slot($meta_instance, $instance, $params)
	   This method is used internally to initialize the attribute's slot
	   in the object $instance.

	   This overrides the Class::MOP::Attribute method to handle lazy
	   attributes, weak references, and type constraints.

       get_value
       set_value
	     eval { $point->meta->get_attribute('x')->set_value($point, 'forty-two') };
	     if($@) {
	       print "Oops: $@\n";
	     }

	   Attribute (x) does not pass the type constraint (Int) with
	   'forty-two'

	   Before setting the value, a check is made on the type constraint of
	   the attribute, if it has one, to see if the value passes it. If the
	   value fails to pass, the set operation dies with a "throw_error".

	   Any coercion to convert values is done before checking the type
	   constraint.

	   To check a value against a type constraint before setting it, fetch
	   the attribute instance using "find_attribute_by_name" in
	   Class::MOP::Class, fetch the type_constraint from the attribute
	   using "type_constraint" in Moose::Meta::Attribute and call "check"
	   in Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint. See
	   Moose::Cookbook::Basics::Recipe4 for an example.

   Attribute Accessor generation
       $attr->install_accessors
	   This method overrides the parent to also install delegation
	   methods.

	   If, after installing all methods, the attribute object has no
	   associated methods, it throws an error unless "is => 'bare'" was
	   passed to the attribute constructor.  (Trying to add an attribute
	   that has no associated methods is almost always an error.)

       $attr->remove_accessors
	   This method overrides the parent to also remove delegation methods.

       $attr->inline_set($instance_var, $value_var)
	   This method return a code snippet suitable for inlining the
	   relevant operation. It expect strings containing variable names to
	   be used in the inlining, like '$self' or '$_[1]'.

       $attr->install_delegation
	   This method adds its delegation methods to the attribute's
	   associated class, if it has any to add.

       $attr->remove_delegation
	   This method remove its delegation methods from the attribute's
	   associated class.

       $attr->accessor_metaclass
	   Returns the accessor metaclass name, which defaults to
	   Moose::Meta::Method::Accessor.

       $attr->delegation_metaclass
	   Returns the delegation metaclass name, which defaults to
	   Moose::Meta::Method::Delegation.

   Additional Moose features
       These methods are not found in the superclass. They support features
       provided by Moose.

       $attr->does($role)
	   This indicates whether the attribute itself does the given role.
	   The role can be given as a full class name, or as a resolvable
	   trait name.

	   Note that this checks the attribute itself, not its type
	   constraint, so it is checking the attribute's metaclass and any
	   traits applied to the attribute.

       Moose::Meta::Class->interpolate_class_and_new($name, %options)
	   This is an alternate constructor that handles the "metaclass" and
	   "traits" options.

	   Effectively, this method is a factory that finds or creates the
	   appropriate class for the given "metaclass" and/or "traits".

	   Once it has the appropriate class, it will call "$class->new($name,
	   %options)" on that class.

       $attr->clone_and_inherit_options(%options)
	   This method supports the "has '+foo'" feature. It does various bits
	   of processing on the supplied %options before ultimately calling
	   the "clone" method.

	   One of its main tasks is to make sure that the %options provided
	   does not include the options returned by the
	   "illegal_options_for_inheritance" method.

       $attr->illegal_options_for_inheritance
	   This returns a blacklist of options that can not be overridden in a
	   subclass's attribute definition.

	   This exists to allow a custom metaclass to change or add to the
	   list of options which can not be changed.

       $attr->type_constraint
	   Returns the Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint object for this attribute,
	   if it has one.

       $attr->has_type_constraint
	   Returns true if this attribute has a type constraint.

       $attr->verify_against_type_constraint($value)
	   Given a value, this method returns true if the value is valid for
	   the attribute's type constraint. If the value is not valid, it
	   throws an error.

       $attr->handles
	   This returns the value of the "handles" option passed to the
	   constructor.

       $attr->has_handles
	   Returns true if this attribute performs delegation.

       $attr->is_weak_ref
	   Returns true if this attribute stores its value as a weak
	   reference.

       $attr->is_required
	   Returns true if this attribute is required to have a value.

       $attr->is_lazy
	   Returns true if this attribute is lazy.

       $attr->is_lazy_build
	   Returns true if the "lazy_build" option was true when passed to the
	   constructor.

       $attr->should_coerce
	   Returns true if the "coerce" option passed to the constructor was
	   true.

       $attr->should_auto_deref
	   Returns true if the "auto_deref" option passed to the constructor
	   was true.

       $attr->trigger
	   This is the subroutine reference that was in the "trigger" option
	   passed to the constructor, if any.

       $attr->has_trigger
	   Returns true if this attribute has a trigger set.

       $attr->documentation
	   Returns the value that was in the "documentation" option passed to
	   the constructor, if any.

       $attr->has_documentation
	   Returns true if this attribute has any documentation.

       $attr->applied_traits
	   This returns an array reference of all the traits which were
	   applied to this attribute. If none were applied, this returns
	   "undef".

       $attr->has_applied_traits
	   Returns true if this attribute has any traits applied.
