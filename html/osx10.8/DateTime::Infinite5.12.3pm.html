NAME
       DateTime::Infinite - Infinite past and future DateTime objects

VERSION
       version 0.70

SYNOPSIS
	 my $future = DateTime::Infinite::Future-&gtnew();
	 my $past   = DateTime::Infinite::Past-&gtnew();

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides two DateTime.pm subclasses,
       "DateTime::Infinite::Future" and "DateTime::Infinite::Past".

       The objects are in the "floating" timezone, and this cannot be changed.

BUGS
       There seem to be lots of problems when dealing with infinite numbers on
       Win32. This may be a problem with this code, Perl, or Win32's IEEE math
       implementation. Either way, the module may not be well-behaved on Win32
       operating systems.

METHODS
       The only constructor for these two classes is the "new()" method, as
       shown in the SYNOPSIS. This method takes no parameters.

       All "get" methods in this module simply return infinity, positive or
       negative. If the method is expected to return a string, it return the
       string representation of positive or negative infinity used by your
       system. For example, on my system calling "year()" returns a number
       which when printed appears either "inf" or "-inf".

       The object is not mutable, so the "set()", "set_time_zone()", and
       "truncate()" methods are all do-nothing methods that simply return the
       object they are called with.

       Obviously, the "is_finite()" method returns false and the
       "is_infinite()" method returns true.
