NAME
       MooseX::Meta::TypeConstraint::ForceCoercion - Force coercion when
       validating type constraints

VERSION
       version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
	   use MooseX::Types:::Moose qw/Str Any/;
	   use Moose::Util::TypeConstraints;
	   use MooseX::Meta::TypeConstraint::ForceCoercion;

	   # get any type constraint
	   my $tc = Str;

	   # declare one or more coercions for it
	   coerce $tc,
	       from Any,
	       via { ... };

	   # wrap the $tc to force coercion
	   my $coercing_tc = MooseX::Meta::TypeConstraint::ForceCoercion-&gtnew(
	       type_constraint =&gt $tc,
	   );

	   # check a value against new type constraint. this will run the type
	   # coercions for the wrapped type, even if the value already passes
	   # validation before coercion. it will fail if the value couldn't be
	   # coerced
	   $coercing_tc-&gtcheck('Affe');

DESCRIPTION
       This class allows to wrap any "Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint" in a way
       that will force coercion of the value when checking or validating a
       value against it.

ATTRIBUTES
   type_constraint
       The type constraint to wrap. All methods except for "validate" and
       "check" are delegated to the value of this attribute.

METHODS
   check ($value)
       Same as "Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint::check", except it will always try
       to coerce $value before checking it against the actual type constraint.
       If coercing fails the check will fail, too.

   validate ($value, $coerced_ref?)
       Same as "Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint::validate", except it will always
       try to coerce $value before validating it against the actual type
       constraint. If coercing fails the validation will fail, too.

       If coercion was successful and a $coerced_ref references was passed,
       the coerced value will be stored in that.
