NAME
       RSA_generate_key - generate RSA key pair

SYNOPSIS
	#include &ltopenssl/rsa.h&gt

	RSA *RSA_generate_key(int num, unsigned long e,
	   void (*callback)(int,int,void *), void *cb_arg);

DESCRIPTION
       RSA_generate_key() generates a key pair and returns it in a newly
       allocated RSA structure. The pseudo-random number generator must be
       seeded prior to calling RSA_generate_key().

       The modulus size will be num bits, and the public exponent will be e.
       Key sizes with num &lt 1024 should be considered insecure.  The exponent
       is an odd number, typically 3, 17 or 65537.

       A callback function may be used to provide feedback about the progress
       of the key generation. If callback is not NULL, it will be called as
       follows:

       o   While a random prime number is generated, it is called as described
	   in BN_generate_prime(3).

       o   When the n-th randomly generated prime is rejected as not suitable
	   for the key, callback(2, n, cb_arg) is called.

       o   When a random p has been found with p-1 relatively prime to e, it
	   is called as callback(3, 0, cb_arg).

       The process is then repeated for prime q with callback(3, 1, cb_arg).

RETURN VALUE
       If key generation fails, RSA_generate_key() returns NULL; the error
       codes can be obtained by ERR_get_error(3).

BUGS
       callback(2, x, cb_arg) is used with two different meanings.

       RSA_generate_key() goes into an infinite loop for illegal input values.

HISTORY
       The cb_arg argument was added in SSLeay 0.9.0.
