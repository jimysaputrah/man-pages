NAME
       glLinkProgram - Links a program object

C SPECIFICATION
       void glLinkProgram(GLuint program);

PARAMETERS
       program
	   Specifies the handle of the program object to be linked.

DESCRIPTION
       glLinkProgram links the program object specified by program. If any
       shader objects of type GL_VERTEX_SHADER are attached to program, they
       will be used to create an executable that will run on the programmable
       vertex processor. If any shader objects of type GL_GEOMETRY_SHADER are
       attached to program, they will be used to create an executable that
       will run on the programmable geometry processor. If any shader objects
       of type GL_FRAGMENT_SHADER are attached to program, they will be used
       to create an executable that will run on the programmable fragment
       processor.

       The status of the link operation will be stored as part of the program
       object's state. This value will be set to GL_TRUE if the program object
       was linked without errors and is ready for use, and GL_FALSE otherwise.
       It can be queried by calling glGetProgram() with arguments program and
       GL_LINK_STATUS.

       As a result of a successful link operation, all active user-defined
       uniform variables belonging to program will be initialized to 0, and
       each of the program object's active uniform variables will be assigned
       a location that can be queried by calling glGetUniformLocation(). Also,
       any active user-defined attribute variables that have not been bound to
       a generic vertex attribute index will be bound to one at this time.

       Linking of a program object can fail for a number of reasons as
       specified in the OpenGL Shading Language Specification. The following
       lists some of the conditions that will cause a link error.

       o   The number of active attribute variables supported by the
	   implementation has been exceeded.

       o   The storage limit for uniform variables has been exceeded.

       o   The number of active uniform variables supported by the
	   implementation has been exceeded.

       o   The main function is missing for the vertex, geometry or fragment
	   shader.

       o   A varying variable actually used in the fragment shader is not
	   declared in the same way (or is not declared at all) in the vertex
	   shader, or geometry shader shader if present.

       o   A reference to a function or variable name is unresolved.

       o   A shared global is declared with two different types or two
	   different initial values.

       o   One or more of the attached shader objects has not been
	   successfully compiled.

       o   Binding a generic attribute matrix caused some rows of the matrix
	   to fall outside the allowed maximum of GL_MAX_VERTEX_ATTRIBS.

       o   Not enough contiguous vertex attribute slots could be found to bind
	   attribute matrices.

       o   The program object contains objects to form a fragment shader but
	   does not contain objects to form a vertex shader.

       o   The program object contains objects to form a geometry shader but
	   does not contain objects to form a vertex shader.

       o   The program object contains objects to form a geometry shader and
	   the input primitive type, output primitive type, or maximum output
	   vertex count is not specified in any compiled geometry shader
	   object.

       o   The program object contains objects to form a geometry shader and
	   the input primitive type, output primitive type, or maximum output
	   vertex count is specified differently in multiple geometry shader
	   objects.

       o   The number of active outputs in the fragment shader is greater than
	   the value of GL_MAX_DRAW_BUFFERS.

       o   The program has an active output assigned to a location greater
	   than or equal to the value of GL_MAX_DUAL_SOURCE_DRAW_BUFFERS and
	   has an active output assigned an index greater than or equal to
	   one.

       o   More than one varying out variable is bound to the same number and
	   index.

       o   The explicit binding assigments do not leave enough space for the
	   linker to automatically assign a location for a varying out array,
	   which requires multiple contiguous locations.

       o   The count specified by glTransformFeedbackVaryings() is non-zero,
	   but the program object has no vertex or geometry shader.

       o   Any variable name specified to glTransformFeedbackVaryings() in the
	   varyings array is not declared as an output in the vertex shader
	   (or the geometry shader, if active).

       o   Any two entries in the varyings array given
	   glTransformFeedbackVaryings() specify the same varying variable.

       o   The total number of components to capture in any transform feedback
	   varying variable is greater than the constant
	   GL_MAX_TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_SEPARATE_COMPONENTS and the buffer mode
	   is SEPARATE_ATTRIBS.

       When a program object has been successfully linked, the program object
       can be made part of current state by calling glUseProgram(). Whether or
       not the link operation was successful, the program object's information
       log will be overwritten. The information log can be retrieved by
       calling glGetProgramInfoLog().

       glLinkProgram will also install the generated executables as part of
       the current rendering state if the link operation was successful and
       the specified program object is already currently in use as a result of
       a previous call to glUseProgram(). If the program object currently in
       use is relinked unsuccessfully, its link status will be set to GL_FALSE
       , but the executables and associated state will remain part of the
       current state until a subsequent call to glUseProgram removes it from
       use. After it is removed from use, it cannot be made part of current
       state until it has been successfully relinked.

       If program contains shader objects of type GL_VERTEX_SHADER, and
       optionally of type GL_GEOMETRY_SHADER, but does not contain shader
       objects of type GL_FRAGMENT_SHADER, the vertex shader executable will
       be installed on the programmable vertex processor, the geometry shader
       executable, if present, will be installed on the programmable geometry
       processor, but no executable will be installed on the fragment
       processor. The results of rasterizing primitives with such a program
       will be undefined.

       The program object's information log is updated and the program is
       generated at the time of the link operation. After the link operation,
       applications are free to modify attached shader objects, compile
       attached shader objects, detach shader objects, delete shader objects,
       and attach additional shader objects. None of these operations affects
       the information log or the program that is part of the program object.

NOTES
       If the link operation is unsuccessful, any information about a previous
       link operation on program is lost (i.e., a failed link does not restore
       the old state of program ). Certain information can still be retrieved
       from program even after an unsuccessful link operation. See for
       instance glGetActiveAttrib() and glGetActiveUniform().

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if program is not a value generated by
       OpenGL.

       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if program is not a program object.

       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if program is the currently active
       program object and transform feedback mode is active.
