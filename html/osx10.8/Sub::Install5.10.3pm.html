NAME
       Sub::Install - install subroutines into packages easily

VERSION
       version 0.925

SYNOPSIS
	 use Sub::Install;

	 Sub::Install::install_sub({
	   code => sub { ... },
	   into => $package,
	   as	=> $subname
	 });

DESCRIPTION
       This module makes it easy to install subroutines into packages without
       the unslightly mess of "no strict" or typeglobs lying about where just
       anyone can see them.

FUNCTIONS
   install_sub
	 Sub::Install::install_sub({
	  code => \&subroutine,
	  into => "Finance::Shady",
	  as   => 'launder',
	 });

       This routine installs a given code reference into a package as a normal
       subroutine.  The above is equivalent to:

	 no strict 'refs';
	 *{"Finance::Shady" . '::' . "launder"} = \&subroutine;

       If "into" is not given, the sub is installed into the calling package.

       If "code" is not a code reference, it is looked for as an existing sub
       in the package named in the "from" parameter.  If "from" is not given,
       it will look in the calling package.

       If "as" is not given, and if "code" is a name, "as" will default to
       "code".	If "as" is not given, but if "code" is a code ref,
       Sub::Install will try to find the name of the given code ref and use
       that as "as".

       That means that this code:

	 Sub::Install::install_sub({
	   code => 'twitch',
	   from => 'Person::InPain',
	   into => 'Person::Teenager',
	   as	=> 'dance',
	 });

       is the same as:

	 package Person::Teenager;

	 Sub::Install::install_sub({
	   code => Person::InPain->can('twitch'),
	   as	=> 'dance',
	 });

   reinstall_sub
       This routine behaves exactly like "install_sub", but does not emit a
       warning if warnings are on and the destination is already defined.

   install_installers
       This routine is provided to allow Sub::Install compatibility with
       Sub::Installer.	It installs "install_sub" and "reinstall_sub" methods
       into the package named by its argument.

	Sub::Install::install_installers('Code::Builder'); # just for us, please
	Code::Builder->install_sub({ name => $code_ref });

	Sub::Install::install_installers('UNIVERSAL'); # feeling lucky, punk?
	Anything::At::All->install_sub({ name => $code_ref });

       The installed installers are similar, but not identical, to those
       provided by Sub::Installer.  They accept a single hash as an argument.
       The key/value pairs are used as the "as" and "code" parameters to the
       "install_sub" routine detailed above.  The package name on which the
       method is called is used as the "into" parameter.

       Unlike Sub::Installer's "install_sub" will not eval strings into code,
       but will look for named code in the calling package.

EXPORTS
       Sub::Install exports "install_sub" and "reinstall_sub" only if they are
       requested.

   exporter
       Sub::Install has a never-exported subroutine called "exporter", which
       is used to implement its "import" routine.  It takes a hashref of named
       arguments, only one of which is currently recognize: "exports".	This
       must be an arrayref of subroutines to offer for export.

       This routine is mainly for Sub::Install's own consumption.  Instead,
       consider Sub::Exporter.

SEE ALSO
       Sub::Installer
	   This module is (obviously) a reaction to Damian Conway's
	   Sub::Installer, which does the same thing, but does it by getting
	   its greasy fingers all over UNIVERSAL.  I was really happy about
	   the idea of making the installation of coderefs less ugly, but I
	   couldn't bring myself to replace the ugliness of typeglobs and
	   loosened strictures with the ugliness of UNIVERSAL methods.

       Sub::Exporter
	   This is a complete Exporter.pm replacement, built atop
	   Sub::Install.
