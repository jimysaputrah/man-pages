NAME
       glBeginConditionalRender - start conditional rendering

C SPECIFICATION
       void glBeginConditionalRender(GLuint id, GLenum mode);

PARAMETERS
       id
	   Specifies the name of an occlusion query object whose results are
	   used to determine if the rendering commands are discarded.

       mode
	   Specifies how glBeginConditionalRender interprets the results of
	   the occlusion query.

C SPECIFICATION
       void glEndConditionalRender(void);

DESCRIPTION
       Conditional rendering is started using glBeginConditionalRender and
       ended using glEndConditionalRender. During conditional rendering, all
       vertex array commands, as well as glClear() and glClearBuffer() have no
       effect if the (GL_SAMPLES_PASSED) result of the query object id is
       zero, or if the (GL_ANY_SAMPLES_PASSED) result is GL_FALSE. The results
       of commands setting the current vertex state, such as glVertexAttrib()
       are undefined. If the (GL_SAMPLES_PASSED) result is non-zero or if the
       (GL_ANY_SAMPLES_PASSED) result is GL_TRUE, such commands are not
       discarded. The id parameter to glBeginConditionalRender must be the
       name of a query object previously returned from a call to
       glGenQueries().	mode specifies how the results of the query object are
       to be interpreted. If mode is GL_QUERY_WAIT, the GL waits for the
       results of the query to be available and then uses the results to
       determine if subsequent rendering commands are discarded. If mode is
       GL_QUERY_NO_WAIT, the GL may choose to unconditionally execute the
       subsequent rendering commands without waiting for the query to
       complete.

       If mode is GL_QUERY_BY_REGION_WAIT, the GL will also wait for occlusion
       query results and discard rendering commands if the result of the
       occlusion query is zero. If the query result is non-zero, subsequent
       rendering commands are executed, but the GL may discard the results of
       the commands for any region of the framebuffer that did not contribute
       to the sample count in the specified occlusion query. Any such
       discarding is done in an implementation-dependent manner, but the
       rendering command results may not be discarded for any samples that
       contributed to the occlusion query sample count. If mode is
       GL_QUERY_BY_REGION_NO_WAIT, the GL operates as in
       GL_QUERY_BY_REGION_WAIT, but may choose to unconditionally execute the
       subsequent rendering commands without waiting for the query to
       complete.

NOTES
       glBeginConditionalRender and glEndConditionalRender are available only
       if the GL version is 3.0 or greater.

       The GL_ANY_SAMPLES_PASSED query result is available only if the GL
       version is 3.3 or greater.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if id is not the name of an existing
       query object.


       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if mode is not one of the accepted tokens.


       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if glBeginConditionalRender is called
       while conditional rendering is active, or if glEndConditionalRender is
       called while conditional rendering is inactive.


       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if id is the name of a query object
       with a target other than GL_SAMPLES_PASSED or GL_ANY_SAMPLES_PASSED.


       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if id is the name of a query
       currently in progress.
