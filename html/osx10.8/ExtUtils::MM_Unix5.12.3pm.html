NAME
       ExtUtils::MM_Unix - methods used by ExtUtils::MakeMaker

SYNOPSIS
       "require ExtUtils::MM_Unix;"

DESCRIPTION
       The methods provided by this package are designed to be used in
       conjunction with ExtUtils::MakeMaker. When MakeMaker writes a Makefile,
       it creates one or more objects that inherit their methods from a
       package "MM". MM itself doesn't provide any methods, but it ISA
       ExtUtils::MM_Unix class. The inheritance tree of MM lets operating
       specific packages take the responsibility for all the methods provided
       by MM_Unix. We are trying to reduce the number of the necessary
       overrides by defining rather primitive operations within
       ExtUtils::MM_Unix.

       If you are going to write a platform specific MM package, please try to
       limit the necessary overrides to primitive methods, and if it is not
       possible to do so, let's work out how to achieve that gain.

       If you are overriding any of these methods in your Makefile.PL (in the
       MY class), please report that to the makemaker mailing list. We are
       trying to minimize the necessary method overrides and switch to data
       driven Makefile.PLs wherever possible. In the long run less methods
       will be overridable via the MY class.

METHODS
       The following description of methods is still under development. Please
       refer to the code for not suitably documented sections and complain
       loudly to the makemaker@perl.org mailing list.  Better yet, provide a
       patch.

       Not all of the methods below are overridable in a Makefile.PL.
       Overridable methods are marked as (o). All methods are overridable by a
       platform specific MM_*.pm file.

       Cross-platform methods are being moved into MM_Any.  If you can't find
       something that used to be in here, look in MM_Any.

   Methods
       os_flavor
	   Simply says that we're Unix.

       c_o (o)
	   Defines the suffix rules to compile different flavors of C files to
	   object files.

       cflags (o)
	   Does very much the same as the cflags script in the perl
	   distribution. It doesn't return the whole compiler command line,
	   but initializes all of its parts. The const_cccmd method then
	   actually returns the definition of the CCCMD macro which uses these
	   parts.

       const_cccmd (o)
	   Returns the full compiler call for C programs and stores the
	   definition in CONST_CCCMD.

       const_config (o)
	   Defines a couple of constants in the Makefile that are imported
	   from %Config.

       const_loadlibs (o)
	   Defines EXTRALIBS, LDLOADLIBS, BSLOADLIBS, LD_RUN_PATH. See
	   ExtUtils::Liblist for details.

       constants (o)
	     my $make_frag = $mm-&gtconstants;

	   Prints out macros for lots of constants.

       depend (o)
	   Same as macro for the depend attribute.

       init_DEST
	     $mm-&gtinit_DEST

	   Defines the DESTDIR and DEST* variables paralleling the INSTALL*.

       init_dist
	     $mm-&gtinit_dist;

	   Defines a lot of macros for distribution support.

	     macro	   description			   default

	     TAR	   tar command to use		   tar
	     TARFLAGS	   flags to pass to TAR 	   cvf

	     ZIP	   zip command to use		   zip
	     ZIPFLAGS	   flags to pass to ZIP 	   -r

	     COMPRESS	   compression command to	   gzip --best
			   use for tarfiles
	     SUFFIX	   suffix to put on		   .gz
			   compressed files

	     SHAR	   shar command to use		   shar

	     PREOP	   extra commands to run before
			   making the archive
	     POSTOP	   extra commands to run after
			   making the archive

	     TO_UNIX	   a command to convert linefeeds
			   to Unix style in your archive

	     CI 	   command to checkin your	   ci -u
			   sources to version control
	     RCS_LABEL	   command to label your sources   rcs -Nv$(VERSION_SYM): -q
			   just after CI is run

	     DIST_CP	   $how argument to manicopy()	   best
			   when the distdir is created

	     DIST_DEFAULT  default target to use to	   tardist
			   create a distribution

	     DISTVNAME	   name of the resulting archive   $(DISTNAME)-$(VERSION)
			   (minus suffixes)

       dist (o)
	     my $dist_macros = $mm-&gtdist(%overrides);

	   Generates a make fragment defining all the macros initialized in
	   init_dist.

	   %overrides can be used to override any of the above.

       dist_basics (o)
	   Defines the targets distclean, distcheck, skipcheck, manifest,
	   veryclean.

       dist_ci (o)
	   Defines a check in target for RCS.

       dist_core (o)
	     my $dist_make_fragment = $MM-&gtdist_core;

	   Puts the targets necessary for 'make dist' together into one make
	   fragment.

       dist_target
	     my $make_frag = $MM-&gtdist_target;

	   Returns the 'dist' target to make an archive for distribution.
	   This target simply checks to make sure the Makefile is up-to-date
	   and depends on $(DIST_DEFAULT).

       tardist_target
	     my $make_frag = $MM-&gttardist_target;

	   Returns the 'tardist' target which is simply so 'make tardist'
	   works.  The real work is done by the dynamically named
	   tardistfile_target() method, tardist should have that as a
	   dependency.

       zipdist_target
	     my $make_frag = $MM-&gtzipdist_target;

	   Returns the 'zipdist' target which is simply so 'make zipdist'
	   works.  The real work is done by the dynamically named
	   zipdistfile_target() method, zipdist should have that as a
	   dependency.

       tarfile_target
	     my $make_frag = $MM-&gttarfile_target;

	   The name of this target is the name of the tarball generated by
	   tardist.  This target does the actual work of turning the distdir
	   into a tarball.

       zipfile_target
	     my $make_frag = $MM-&gtzipfile_target;

	   The name of this target is the name of the zip file generated by
	   zipdist.  This target does the actual work of turning the distdir
	   into a zip file.

       uutardist_target
	     my $make_frag = $MM-&gtuutardist_target;

	   Converts the tarfile into a uuencoded file

       shdist_target
	     my $make_frag = $MM-&gtshdist_target;

	   Converts the distdir into a shell archive.

       dlsyms (o)
	   Used by some OS' to define DL_FUNCS and DL_VARS and write the *.exp
	   files.

	   Normally just returns an empty string.

       dynamic_bs (o)
	   Defines targets for bootstrap files.

       dynamic_lib (o)
	   Defines how to produce the *.so (or equivalent) files.

       exescan
	   Deprecated method. Use libscan instead.

       extliblist
	   Called by init_others, and calls ext ExtUtils::Liblist. See
	   ExtUtils::Liblist for details.

       find_perl
	   Finds the executables PERL and FULLPERL

       fixin
	     $mm-&gtfixin(@files);

	   Inserts the sharpbang or equivalent magic number to a set of
	   @files.

       force (o)
	   Writes an empty FORCE: target.

       guess_name
	   Guess the name of this package by examining the working directory's
	   name. MakeMaker calls this only if the developer has not supplied a
	   NAME attribute.

       has_link_code
	   Returns true if C, XS, MYEXTLIB or similar objects exist within
	   this object that need a compiler. Does not descend into
	   subdirectories as needs_linking() does.

       init_dirscan
	   Scans the directory structure and initializes DIR, XS, XS_FILES, C,
	   C_FILES, O_FILES, H, H_FILES, PL_FILES, EXE_FILES.

	   Called by init_main.

       init_MANPODS
	   Determines if man pages should be generated and initializes
	   MAN1PODS and MAN3PODS as appropriate.

       init_MAN1PODS
	   Initializes MAN1PODS from the list of EXE_FILES.

       init_MAN3PODS
	   Initializes MAN3PODS from the list of PM files.

       init_PM
	   Initializes PMLIBDIRS and PM from PMLIBDIRS.

       init_DIRFILESEP
	   Using / for Unix.  Called by init_main.

       init_main
	   Initializes AR, AR_STATIC_ARGS, BASEEXT, CONFIG, DISTNAME, DLBASE,
	   EXE_EXT, FULLEXT, FULLPERL, FULLPERLRUN, FULLPERLRUNINST, INST_*,
	   INSTALL*, INSTALLDIRS, LIB_EXT, LIBPERL_A, MAP_TARGET, NAME,

	   LD, OBJECT, BOOTDEP, PERLMAINCC, LDFROM, LINKTYPE, SHELL, NOOP,
	   FIRST_MAKEFILE, MAKEFILE_OLD, NOECHO, RM_F, RM_RF, TEST_F, TOUCH,
	   CP, MV, CHMOD, UMASK_NULL, ECHO, ECHO_N

       init_linker
	   Unix has no need of special linker flags.

       init_PERL
	       $mm-&gtinit_PERL;

	   Called by init_main.  Sets up ABSPERL, PERL, FULLPERL and all the
	   *PERLRUN* permutations.

	       PERL is allowed to be miniperl
	       FULLPERL must be a complete perl

	       ABSPERL is PERL converted to an absolute path

	       *PERLRUN contains everything necessary to run perl, find it's
		    libraries, etc...

	       *PERLRUNINST is *PERLRUN + everything necessary to find the
		    modules being built.

       init_platform
       platform_constants
	   Add MM_Unix_VERSION.

       init_PERM
	     $mm-&gtinit_PERM

	   Called by init_main.  Initializes PERL_*

       init_xs
	       $mm-&gtinit_xs

	   Sets up macros having to do with XS code.  Currently just
	   INST_STATIC, INST_DYNAMIC and INST_BOOT.

       install (o)
	   Defines the install target.

       installbin (o)
	   Defines targets to make and to install EXE_FILES.

       linkext (o)
	   Defines the linkext target which in turn defines the LINKTYPE.

       lsdir
	   Takes as arguments a directory name and a regular expression.
	   Returns all entries in the directory that match the regular
	   expression.

       macro (o)
	   Simple subroutine to insert the macros defined by the macro
	   attribute into the Makefile.

       makeaperl (o)
	   Called by staticmake. Defines how to write the Makefile to produce
	   a static new perl.

	   By default the Makefile produced includes all the static extensions
	   in the perl library. (Purified versions of library files, e.g.,
	   DynaLoader_pure_p1_c0_032.a are automatically ignored to avoid link
	   errors.)

       makefile (o)
	   Defines how to rewrite the Makefile.

       maybe_command
	   Returns true, if the argument is likely to be a command.

       needs_linking (o)
	   Does this module need linking? Looks into subdirectory objects (see
	   also has_link_code())

       parse_abstract
	   parse a file and return what you think is the ABSTRACT

       parse_version
	       my $version = MM-&gtparse_version($file);

	   Parse a $file and return what $VERSION is set to by the first
	   assignment.	It will return the string "undef" if it can't figure
	   out what $VERSION is. $VERSION should be for all to see, so "our
	   $VERSION" or plain $VERSION are okay, but "my $VERSION" is not.

	   "&ltpackage Foo VERSION"&gt is also checked for.  The first version
	   declaration found is used, but this may change as it differs from
	   how Perl does it.

	   parse_version() will try to "use version" before checking for
	   $VERSION so the following will work.

	       $VERSION = qv(1.2.3);

       pasthru (o)
	   Defines the string that is passed to recursive make calls in
	   subdirectories.

       perl_script
	   Takes one argument, a file name, and returns the file name, if the
	   argument is likely to be a perl script. On MM_Unix this is true for
	   any ordinary, readable file.

       perldepend (o)
	   Defines the dependency from all *.h files that come with the perl
	   distribution.

       pm_to_blib
	   Defines target that copies all files in the hash PM to their
	   destination and autosplits them. See "DESCRIPTION" in
	   ExtUtils::Install

       post_constants (o)
	   Returns an empty string per default. Dedicated to overrides from
	   within Makefile.PL after all constants have been defined.

       post_initialize (o)
	   Returns an empty string per default. Used in Makefile.PLs to add
	   some chunk of text to the Makefile after the object is initialized.

       postamble (o)
	   Returns an empty string. Can be used in Makefile.PLs to write some
	   text to the Makefile at the end.

       ppd Defines target that creates a PPD (Perl Package Description) file
	   for a binary distribution.

       prefixify
	     $MM-&gtprefixify($var, $prefix, $new_prefix, $default);

	   Using either $MM-&gt{uc $var} || $Config{lc $var}, it will attempt to
	   replace it's $prefix with a $new_prefix.

	   Should the $prefix fail to match AND a PREFIX was given as an
	   argument to WriteMakefile() it will set it to the $new_prefix +
	   $default.  This is for systems whose file layouts don't neatly fit
	   into our ideas of prefixes.

	   This is for heuristics which attempt to create directory structures
	   that mirror those of the installed perl.

	   For example:

	       $MM-&gtprefixify('installman1dir', '/usr', '/home/foo', 'man/man1');

	   this will attempt to remove '/usr' from the front of the
	   $MM-&gt{INSTALLMAN1DIR} path (initializing it to
	   $Config{installman1dir} if necessary) and replace it with
	   '/home/foo'.  If this fails it will simply use
	   '/home/foo/man/man1'.

       processPL (o)
	   Defines targets to run *.PL files.

       quote_paren
	   Backslashes parentheses "()" in command line arguments.  Doesn't
	   handle recursive Makefile "$(...)" constructs, but handles simple
	   ones.

       replace_manpage_separator
	     my $man_name = $MM-&gtreplace_manpage_separator($file_path);

	   Takes the name of a package, which may be a nested package, in the
	   form 'Foo/Bar.pm' and replaces the slash with "::" or something
	   else safe for a man page file name.	Returns the replacement.

       cd
       oneliner
       quote_literal
       escape_newlines
       max_exec_len
	   Using POSIX::ARG_MAX.  Otherwise falling back to 4096.

       static (o)
	   Defines the static target.

       static_lib (o)
	   Defines how to produce the *.a (or equivalent) files.

       staticmake (o)
	   Calls makeaperl.

       subdir_x (o)
	   Helper subroutine for subdirs

       subdirs (o)
	   Defines targets to process subdirectories.

       test (o)
	   Defines the test targets.

       test_via_harness (override)
	   For some reason which I forget, Unix machines like to have
	   PERL_DL_NONLAZY set for tests.

       test_via_script (override)
	   Again, the PERL_DL_NONLAZY thing.

       tool_xsubpp (o)
	   Determines typemaps, xsubpp version, prototype behaviour.

       all_target
	   Build man pages, too

       top_targets (o)
	   Defines the targets all, subdirs, config, and O_FILES

       writedoc
	   Obsolete, deprecated method. Not used since Version 5.21.

       xs_c (o)
	   Defines the suffix rules to compile XS files to C.

       xs_cpp (o)
	   Defines the suffix rules to compile XS files to C++.

       xs_o (o)
	   Defines suffix rules to go from XS to object files directly. This
	   is only intended for broken make implementations.
