NAME
       Net::DNS::RR::TSIG - DNS TSIG resource record

SYNOPSIS
       "use Net::DNS::RR";

DESCRIPTION
       Class for DNS Transaction Signature (TSIG) resource records.

METHODS
   algorithm
	   $rr-&gtalgorithm($algorithm_name);
	   print "algorithm = ", $rr-&gtalgorithm, "\n";

       Gets or sets the domain name that specifies the name of the algorithm.
       The only algorithm currently supported is HMAC-MD5.SIG-ALG.REG.INT.

   time_signed
	   $rr-&gttime_signed(time);
	   print "time signed = ", $rr-&gttime_signed, "\n";

       Gets or sets the signing time as the number of seconds since 1 Jan 1970
       00:00:00 UTC.

       The default signing time is the current time.

   fudge
	   $rr-&gtfudge(60);
	   print "fudge = ", $rr-&gtfudge, "\n";

       Gets or sets the "fudge", i.e., the seconds of error permitted in the
       signing time.

       The default fudge is 300 seconds.

   mac_size
	   print "MAC size = ", $rr-&gtmac_size, "\n";

       Returns the number of octets in the message authentication code (MAC).
       The programmer must call a Net::DNS::Packet object's data method before
       this will return anything meaningful.

   mac
	   print "MAC = ", $rr-&gtmac, "\n";

       Returns the message authentication code (MAC) as a string of hex
       characters.  The programmer must call a Net::DNS::Packet object's data
       method before this will return anything meaningful.

   original_id
	   $rr-&gtoriginal_id(12345);
	   print "original ID = ", $rr-&gtoriginal_id, "\n";

       Gets or sets the original message ID.

   error
	   print "error = ", $rr-&gterror, "\n";

       Returns the RCODE covering TSIG processing.  Common values are NOERROR,
       BADSIG, BADKEY, and BADTIME.  See RFC 2845 for details.

   other_len
	   print "other len = ", $rr-&gtother_len, "\n";

       Returns the length of the Other Data.  Should be zero unless the error
       is BADTIME.

   other_data
	   print "other data = ", $rr-&gtother_data, "\n";

       Returns the Other Data.	This field should be empty unless the error is
       BADTIME, in which case it will contain the server's time as the number
       of seconds since 1 Jan 1970 00:00:00 UTC.

   sig_data
	    my $sigdata = $tsig-&gtsig_data($packet);

       Returns the packet packed according to RFC2845 in a form for signing.
       This is only needed if you want to supply an external signing function,
       such as is needed for TSIG-GSS.

   sign_func
	    sub my_sign_fn($$) {
		    my ($key, $data) = @_;

		    return some_digest_algorithm($key, $data);
	    }

	    $tsig-&gtsign_func(\&my_sign_fn);

       This sets the signing function to be used for this TSIG record.

       The default signing function is HMAC-MD5.

BUGS
       This code is still under development.  Use with caution on production
       systems.

       The time_signed and other_data fields should be 48-bit unsigned
       integers (RFC 2845, Sections 2.3 and 4.5.2).  The current
       implementation ignores the upper 16 bits; this will cause problems for
       times later than 19 Jan 2038 03:14:07 UTC.

       The only builtin algorithm currently supported is
       HMAC-MD5.SIG-ALG.REG.INT. You can use other algorithms by supplying an
       appropriate sign_func.
