NAME
       glSelectBuffer - establish a buffer for selection mode values


C SPECIFICATION
       void glSelectBuffer( GLsizei size,
			    GLuint *buffer )


PARAMETERS
       size    Specifies the size of buffer.

       buffer  Returns the selection data.

DESCRIPTION
       glSelectBuffer  has  two  arguments: buffer is a pointer to an array of
       unsigned integers, and size indicates the size of  the  array.	buffer
       returns	values	from  the  name  stack	(see  glInitNames, glLoadName,
       glPushName) when the rendering mode is  GL_SELECT  (see	glRenderMode).
       glSelectBuffer  must be issued before selection mode is enabled, and it
       must not be issued while the rendering mode is GL_SELECT.

       A programmer can use selection to determine which primitives are  drawn
       into  some  region  of  a window.  The region is defined by the current
       modelview and perspective matrices.

       In selection mode, no pixel fragments are produced from	rasterization.
       Instead,  if  a	primitive or a raster position intersects the clipping
       volume defined by the viewing frustum  and  the	user-defined  clipping
       planes,	this primitive causes a selection hit.	(With polygons, no hit
       occurs if the polygon is culled.)  When a change is made  to  the  name
       stack, or when glRenderMode is called, a hit record is copied to buffer
       if any hits have occurred since the last such event (name stack	change
       or  glRenderMode call).	The hit record consists of the number of names
       in the name stack at the time of the event, followed by the minimum and
       maximum depth values of all vertices that hit since the previous event,
       followed by the name stack contents, bottom name first.

       Depth values (which are in the range [0,1]) are multiplied by 2^32 - 1,
       before being placed in the hit record.

       An  internal index into buffer is reset to 0 whenever selection mode is
       entered.  Each time a hit record is copied into buffer,	the  index  is
       incremented  to	point  to  the	cell just past the end of the block of
       names - that is, to the next available cell.   If  the  hit  record  is
       larger  than  the number of remaining locations in buffer, as much data
       as can fit is copied, and the overflow flag is set.  If the name  stack
       is  empty  when	a hit record is copied, that record consists of 0 fol-
       lowed by the minimum and maximum depth values.

       To exit selection mode, call glRenderMode with an argument  other  than
       GL_SELECT.   Whenever  glRenderMode  is called while the render mode is
       GL_SELECT, it returns the number  of  hit  records  copied  to  buffer,
       resets the overflow flag and the selection buffer pointer, and initial-
       izes the name stack to be empty.  If the  overflow  bit	was  set  when
       glRenderMode was called, a negative hit record count is returned.

NOTES
       The  contents  of buffer is undefined until glRenderMode is called with
       an argument other than GL_SELECT.

       glBegin/glEnd primitives and calls to glRasterPos can result in hits.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if size is negative.

       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if glSelectBuffer is called while the
       render  mode  is  GL_SELECT, or if glRenderMode is called with argument
       GL_SELECT before glSelectBuffer is called at least once.

       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if glSelectBuffer is executed between
       the execution of glBegin and the corresponding execution of glEnd.

ASSOCIATED GETS
       glGet with argument GL_NAME_STACK_DEPTH
       glGet with argument GL_SELECTION_BUFFER_SIZE
       glGetPointerv with argument GL_SELECTION_BUFFER_POINTER
