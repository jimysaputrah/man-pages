LUTIMES(3)		 BSD Library Functions Manual		    LUTIMES(3)

NAME
     lutimes -- set file access and modification times of symlink

SYNOPSIS
     #include &ltsys/time.h&gt

     int
     lutimes(const char *path, struct timeval times[2]);

DESCRIPTION
     The access and modification times of the file named by path are changed
     as specified by the argument times, even if path specifies a symbolic
     link (for utimes(2) the times of the file referenced by the symbolic link
     are changed).

     If times is NULL, the access and modification times are set to the cur-
     rent time.  The caller must be the owner of the file, have permission to
     write the file, or be the super-user.

     If times is non-NULL, it is assumed to point to an array of two timeval
     structures.  The access time is set to the value of the first element,
     and the modification time is set to the value of the second element.  The
     caller must be the owner of the file or be the super-user.

     In either case, the inode-change-time of the file is set to the current
     time.

NOTE
     Instead of being a system call, lutimes() is emulated using
     setattrlist(2).  Not all file systems support setattrlist(2).

RETURN VALUES
     Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned.  Otherwise, -1 is
     returned and the global variable errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
     The lutimes() call may return the same errors as utimes(2) and
     setattrlist(2).
