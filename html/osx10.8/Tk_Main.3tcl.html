NAME
       Tk_Main - main program for Tk-based applications

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lttk.h&gt

       Tk_Main(argc, argv, appInitProc)

ARGUMENTS
       int argc (in)				  Number  of elements in argv.

       char *argv[] (in)			  Array of strings  containing
						  command-line arguments.

       Tcl_AppInitProc *appInitProc (in)	  Address  of  an application-
						  specific initialization pro-

DESCRIPTION
       Tk_Main	acts  as  the  main  program  for  most Tk-based applications.
       Starting with Tk 4.0 it is not called main anymore because it  is  part
       of the Tk library and having a function main in a library (particularly
       a shared library) causes problems on many systems.  Having main in  the
       Tk library would also make it hard to use Tk in C++ programs, since C++
       programs must have special C++ main functions.

       Normally each application contains a  small  main  function  that  does
       nothing but invoke Tk_Main.  Tk_Main then does all the work of creating
       and running a wish-like application.

       When it is has finished its own initialization, but before it processes
       commands,  Tk_Main  calls  the procedure given by the appInitProc argu-
       ment.  This procedure provides a "hook" for the application to  perform
       its own initialization, such as defining application-specific commands.
       The procedure must have an interface that matches the type Tcl_AppInit-
       Proc:
	      typedef int Tcl_AppInitProc(Tcl_Interp *interp);
       AppInitProc is almost always a pointer to Tcl_AppInit; for more details
       on this procedure, see the documentation for Tcl_AppInit.
