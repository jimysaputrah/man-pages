NAME
       XML::Parser::Style::Stream - Stream style for XML::Parser

SYNOPSIS
	 use XML::Parser;
	 my $p = XML::Parser-&gtnew(Style =&gt 'Stream', Pkg =&gt 'MySubs');
	 $p-&gtparsefile('foo.xml');

	 {
	   package MySubs;

	   sub StartTag {
	     my ($e, $name) = @_;
	     # do something with start tags
	   }

	   sub EndTag {
	     my ($e, $name) = @_;
	     # do something with end tags
	   }

	   sub Characters {
	     my ($e, $data) = @_;
	     # do something with text nodes
	   }
	 }

DESCRIPTION
       This style uses the Pkg option to find subs in a given package to call
       for each event.	If none of the subs that this style looks for is
       there, then the effect of parsing with this style is to print a
       canonical copy of the document without comments or declarations.  All
       the subs receive as their 1st parameter the Expat instance for the
       document they're parsing.

       It looks for the following routines:

       o   StartDocument

	   Called at the start of the parse .

       o   StartTag

	   Called for every start tag with a second parameter of the element
	   type. The $_ variable will contain a copy of the tag and the %_
	   variable will contain attribute values supplied for that element.

       o   EndTag

	   Called for every end tag with a second parameter of the element
	   type. The $_ variable will contain a copy of the end tag.

       o   Text

	   Called just before start or end tags with accumulated non-markup
	   text in the $_ variable.

       o   PI

	   Called for processing instructions. The $_ variable will contain a
	   copy of the PI and the target and data are sent as 2nd and 3rd
	   parameters respectively.

       o   EndDocument

	   Called at conclusion of the parse.
