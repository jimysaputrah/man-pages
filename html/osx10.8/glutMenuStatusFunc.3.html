NAME
       glutMenuStatusFunc - sets the global menu status callback.

SYNTAX
       #include &ltGLUT/glut.h&gt

       void glutMenuStatusFunc(void (*func)(int status, int x, int y));
       void glutMenuStateFunc(void (*func)(int status));

ARGUMENTS
       func	 The new menu status (or state) callback function.

DESCRIPTION
       glutMenuStatusFunc  sets the global menu status callback so a GLUT pro-
       gram can determine when a menu is in use or not.  When  a  menu	status
       callback   is   registered,   it   will	 be   called  with  the  value
       GLUT_MENU_IN_USE for its value parameter when pop-up menus are  in  use
       by   the  user;	and  the  callback  will  be  called  with  the  value
       GLUT_MENU_NOT_IN_USE for its status parameter when pop-up menus are  no
       longer  in  use. The x and y parameters indicate the location in window
       coordinates of the button press that caused the menu to go into use, or
       the  location  where the menu was released (may be outside the window).
       The func parameter names the callback function.	Other  callbacks  con-
       tinue  to operate (except mouse motion callbacks) when pop-up menus are
       in use so the menu status callback allows a program to  suspend	anima-
       tion  or other tasks when menus are in use. The cascading and unmapping
       of sub-menus from an initial pop-up menu does not generate menu	status
       callbacks. There is a single menu status callback for GLUT.

       When  the  menu status callback is called, the current menu will be set
       to  the	initial  pop-up  menu  in  both   the	GLUT_MENU_IN_USE   and
       GLUT_MENU_NOT_IN_USE  cases. The current window will be set to the win-
       dow from which the initial menu was popped up from, also in both cases.

       Passing	NULL to glutMenuStatusFunc disables the generation of the menu
       status callback.

       glutMenuStateFunc is a deprecated  version  of  the  glutMenuStatusFunc
       routine.  The  only  difference is glutMenuStateFunc callback prototype
       does not deliver the two additional x and y coordinates.
