NAME
       Path::Class::File - Objects representing files

SYNOPSIS
	 use Path::Class qw(file);  # Export a short constructor

	 my $file = file('foo', 'bar.txt');  # Path::Class::File object
	 my $file = Path::Class::File-&gtnew('foo', 'bar.txt'); # Same thing

	 # Stringifies to 'foo/bar.txt' on Unix, 'foo\bar.txt' on Windows, etc.
	 print "file: $file\n";

	 if ($file-&gtis_absolute) { ... }
	 if ($file-&gtis_relative) { ... }

	 my $v = $file-&gtvolume; # Could be 'C:' on Windows, empty string
				# on Unix, 'Macintosh HD:' on Mac OS

	 $file-&gtcleanup; # Perform logical cleanup of pathname
	 $file-&gtresolve; # Perform physical cleanup of pathname

	 my $dir = $file-&gtdir;	# A Path::Class::Dir object

	 my $abs = $file-&gtabsolute; # Transform to absolute path
	 my $rel = $file-&gtrelative; # Transform to relative path

DESCRIPTION
       The "Path::Class::File" class contains functionality for manipulating
       file names in a cross-platform way.

METHODS
       $file = Path::Class::File-&gtnew( &ltdir1&gt, &ltdir2&gt, ..., &ltfile&gt )
       $file = file( &ltdir1&gt, &ltdir2&gt, ..., &ltfile&gt )
	   Creates a new "Path::Class::File" object and returns it.  The
	   arguments specify the path to the file.  Any volume may also be
	   specified as the first argument, or as part of the first argument.
	   You can use platform-neutral syntax:

	     my $dir = file( 'foo', 'bar', 'baz.txt' );

	   or platform-native syntax:

	     my $dir = dir( 'foo/bar/baz.txt' );

	   or a mixture of the two:

	     my $dir = dir( 'foo/bar', 'baz.txt' );

	   All three of the above examples create relative paths.  To create
	   an absolute path, either use the platform native syntax for doing
	   so:

	     my $dir = dir( '/var/tmp/foo.txt' );

	   or use an empty string as the first argument:

	     my $dir = dir( '', 'var', 'tmp', 'foo.txt' );

	   If the second form seems awkward, that's somewhat intentional -
	   paths like "/var/tmp" or "\Windows" aren't cross-platform concepts
	   in the first place, so they probably shouldn't appear in your code
	   if you're trying to be cross-platform.  The first form is perfectly
	   fine, because paths like this may come from config files, user
	   input, or whatever.

       $file-&gtstringify
	   This method is called internally when a "Path::Class::File" object
	   is used in a string context, so the following are equivalent:

	     $string = $file-&gtstringify;
	     $string = "$file";

       $file-&gtvolume
	   Returns the volume (e.g. "C:" on Windows, "Macintosh HD:" on Mac
	   OS, etc.) of the object, if any.  Otherwise, returns the empty
	   string.

       $file-&gtbasename
	   Returns the name of the file as a string, without the directory
	   portion (if any).

       $file-&gtis_dir
	   Returns a boolean value indicating whether this object represents a
	   directory.  Not surprisingly, "Path::Class::File" objects always
	   return false, and "Path::Class::Dir" objects always return true.

       $file-&gtis_absolute
	   Returns true or false depending on whether the file refers to an
	   absolute path specifier (like "/usr/local/foo.txt" or
	   "\Windows\Foo.txt").

       $file-&gtis_absolute
	   Returns true or false depending on whether the file refers to a
	   relative path specifier (like "lib/foo.txt" or ".\Foo.txt").

       $file-&gtcleanup
	   Performs a logical cleanup of the file path.  For instance:

	     my $file = file('/foo//baz/./foo.txt')-&gtcleanup;
	     # $file now represents '/foo/baz/foo.txt';

       $dir-&gtresolve
	   Performs a physical cleanup of the file path.  For instance:

	     my $dir = dir('/foo/baz/../foo.txt')-&gtresolve;
	     # $dir now represents '/foo/foo.txt', assuming no symlinks

	   This actually consults the filesystem to verify the validity of the
	   path.

       $dir = $file-&gtdir
	   Returns a "Path::Class::Dir" object representing the directory
	   containing this file.

       $dir = $file-&gtparent
	   A synonym for the "dir()" method.

       $abs = $file-&gtabsolute
	   Returns a "Path::Class::File" object representing $file as an
	   absolute path.  An optional argument, given as either a string or a
	   "Path::Class::Dir" object, specifies the directory to use as the
	   base of relativity - otherwise the current working directory will
	   be used.

       $rel = $file-&gtrelative
	   Returns a "Path::Class::File" object representing $file as a
	   relative path.  An optional argument, given as either a string or a
	   "Path::Class::Dir" object, specifies the directory to use as the
	   base of relativity - otherwise the current working directory will
	   be used.

       $foreign = $file-&gtas_foreign($type)
	   Returns a "Path::Class::File" object representing $file as it would
	   be specified on a system of type $type.  Known types include
	   "Unix", "Win32", "Mac", "VMS", and "OS2", i.e. anything for which
	   there is a subclass of "File::Spec".

	   Any generated objects (subdirectories, files, parents, etc.) will
	   also retain this type.

       $foreign = Path::Class::File-&gtnew_foreign($type, @args)
	   Returns a "Path::Class::File" object representing a file as it
	   would be specified on a system of type $type.  Known types include
	   "Unix", "Win32", "Mac", "VMS", and "OS2", i.e. anything for which
	   there is a subclass of "File::Spec".

	   The arguments in @args are the same as they would be specified in
	   "new()".

       $fh = $file-&gtopen($mode, $permissions)
	   Passes the given arguments, including $file, to "IO::File-&gtnew"
	   (which in turn calls "IO::File-&gtopen" and returns the result as an
	   "IO::File" object.  If the opening fails, "undef" is returned and
	   $! is set.

       $fh = $file-&gtopenr()
	   A shortcut for

	    $fh = $file-&gtopen('r') or die "Can't read $file: $!";

       $fh = $file-&gtopenw()
	   A shortcut for

	    $fh = $file-&gtopen('w') or die "Can't write $file: $!";

       $file-&gttouch
	   Sets the modification and access time of the given file to right
	   now, if the file exists.  If it doesn't exist, "touch()" will make
	   it exist, and - YES! - set its modification and access time to now.

       $file-&gtslurp()
	   In a scalar context, returns the contents of $file in a string.  In
	   a list context, returns the lines of $file (according to how $/ is
	   set) as a list.  If the file can't be read, this method will throw
	   an exception.

	   If you want "chomp()" run on each line of the file, pass a true
	   value for the "chomp" or "chomped" parameters:

	     my @lines = $file-&gtslurp(chomp =&gt 1);

       $file-&gtremove()
	   This method will remove the file in a way that works well on all
	   platforms, and returns a boolean value indicating whether or not
	   the file was successfully removed.

	   "remove()" is better than simply calling Perl's "unlink()"
	   function, because on some platforms (notably VMS) you actually may
	   need to call "unlink()" several times before all versions of the
	   file are gone - the "remove()" method handles this process for you.

       $st = $file-&gtstat()
	   Invokes "File::stat::stat()" on this file and returns a
	   "File::stat" object representing the result.

       $st = $file-&gtlstat()
	   Same as "stat()", but if $file is a symbolic link, "lstat()" stats
	   the link instead of the file the link points to.
