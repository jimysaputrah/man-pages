NAME
       gluTessVertex - specify a vertex on a polygon


C SPECIFICATION
       void gluTessVertex( GLUtesselator* tess,
			   GLdouble *location,
			   GLvoid* data )


PARAMETERS
       tess	 Specifies  the tessellation object (created with gluNewTess).

       location  Specifies the location of the vertex.

       data	 Specifies an opaque pointer passed back to the  program  with
		 the vertex callback (as specified by gluTessCallback).

DESCRIPTION
       gluTessVertex describes a vertex on a polygon that the program defines.
       Successive gluTessVertex calls describe a closed contour. For  example,
       to  describe a quadrilateral gluTessVertex should be called four times.
       gluTessVertex  can  only  be  called  between  gluTessBeginContour  and
       gluTessEndContour.

       data  normally points to a structure containing the vertex location, as
       well as other per-vertex attributes such as  color  and	normal.   This
       pointer	is  passed  back  to  the  user through the GLU_TESS_VERTEX or
       GLU_TESS_VERTEX_DATA   callback	  after    tessellation    (see    the
       gluTessCallback reference page).

EXAMPLE
       A  quadrilateral  with a triangular hole in it can be described as fol-
       lows:

       gluTessBeginPolygon(tobj, NULL);
	gluTessBeginContour(tobj);
	  gluTessVertex(tobj, v1, v1);
	  gluTessVertex(tobj, v2, v2);
	  gluTessVertex(tobj, v3, v3);
	  gluTessVertex(tobj, v4, v4);
	gluTessEndContour(tobj);
	gluTessBeginContour(tobj);
	  gluTessVertex(tobj, v5, v5);
	  gluTessVertex(tobj, v6, v6);
	  gluTessVertex(tobj, v7, v7);
	gluTessEndContour(tobj); gluTessEndPolygon(tobj);


NOTES
       It is a common error to use a local variable for location or  data  and
       store  values  into it as part of a loop.  For example: for (i = 0; i &lt
       NVERTICES; ++i) {
	 GLdouble data[3];
	 data[0] = vertex[i][0];
	 data[1] = vertex[i][1];
	 data[2] = vertex[i][2];
	 gluTessVertex(tobj, data, data);
	 }

       This doesn't work.  Because the pointers specified by location and data
       might  not be dereferenced until gluTessEndPolygon is executed, all the
       vertex coordinates but the very last set could  be  overwritten	before
       tessellation begins.

       Two  common  symptoms  of  this	problem are consists of a single point
       (when   a   local    variable	is    used    for    data)    and    a
       GLU_TESS_NEED_COMBINE_CALLBACK error (when a local variable is used for
       location).
