NAME
       mime.types - mime type description file for cups

DESCRIPTION
       The mime.types file defines the recognized file types.

       Additional  file  types	can  be added to mime.types or (preferably) in
       additional files in the CUPS configuration directory with the extension
       ".types".

       Each  line  in  the  mime.types file is a comment, blank, or rule line.
       Comment lines start with the # character. Rule  lines  start  with  the
       MIME type name and are optionally followed by a series of file recogni-
       tion rules that are used to automatically identify print and web files:

	   super/type rule [ ... ruleN]
       MIME  type  names  are  case-insensitive  and  are  sorted in ascending
       alphanumeric order for the purposes of matching. See the "TYPE MATCHING
       AND PRIORITY" section for more information.

       The rules may be grouped using parenthesis, joined using "+" for a log-
       ical AND and "," or whitespace for a logical OR, and negated using "!".

RULES
       Rules  take  two  forms	- a filename extension by itself and functions
       with test values inside parenthesis. The following functions are avail-
       able:

       match("pattern")
	    Pattern match on filename

       ascii(offset,length)
	    True if bytes are valid printable ASCII (CR, NL, TAB, BS, 32-126)

       printable(offset,length)
	    True  if bytes are printable 8-bit chars (CR, NL, TAB, BS, 32-126,
	    128-254)

       priority(number)
	    Specifies the relative priority of this  MIME  type.  The  default
	    priority is 100.  Larger values have higher priority while smaller
	    values have lower priority.

       string(offset,"string")
	    True if bytes are identical to string

       istring(offset,"string")
	    True if a case-insensitive comparison of the bytes is identical

       char(offset,value)
	    True if byte is identical

       short(offset,value)
	    True if 16-bit integer is identical

       int(offset,value)
	    True if 32-bit integer is identical

       locale("string")
	    True if current locale matches string

       contains(offset,range,"string")
	    True if the range contains the string

STRING CONSTANTS
       String constants can be specified inside quotes ("") for  strings  con-
       taining whitespace and angle brackets (&lt&gt) for hexadecimal strings.

TYPE MATCHING AND PRIORITY
       When  CUPS  needs to determine the MIME type of a given file, it checks
       every MIME type defined in the .types files. When two  types  have  the
       same  matching  rules, the type chosen will depend on the type name and
       priority, with higher- priority types being  used  over	lower-priority
       ones.  If  the  types have the same priority, the type names are sorted
       alphanumerically in ascending order and the first type is chosen.

       For example, if two types "text/bar"  and  "text/foo"  are  defined  as
       matching the extension "doc", normally the type "text/bar" will be cho-
       sen since its name is alphanumerically smaller  than  "text/foo".  How-
       ever,  if  "text/foo"  also  defines a higher priority than "text/bar",
       "text/foo" will be chosen instead.
