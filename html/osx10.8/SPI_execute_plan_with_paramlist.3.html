NAME
       SPI_execute_plan_with_paramlist - execute a plan prepared by
       SPI_prepare

SYNOPSIS
       int SPI_execute_plan_with_paramlist(SPIPlanPtr plan,
					   ParamListInfo params,
					   bool read_only,
					   long count)

DESCRIPTION
       SPI_execute_plan_with_paramlist executes a plan prepared by
       SPI_prepare. This function is equivalent to SPI_execute_plan except
       that information about the parameter values to be passed to the query
       is presented differently. The ParamListInfo representation can be
       convenient for passing down values that are already available in that
       format. It also supports use of dynamic parameter sets via hook
       functions specified in ParamListInfo.

ARGUMENTS
       SPIPlanPtr plan
	   execution plan (returned by SPI_prepare)

       ParamListInfo params
	   data structure containing parameter types and values; NULL if none

       bool read_only
	   true for read-only execution

       long count
	   maximum number of rows to process or return

RETURN VALUE
       The return value is the same as for SPI_execute_plan.


       SPI_processed and SPI_tuptable are set as in SPI_execute_plan if
       successful.
