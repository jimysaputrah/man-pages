NAME
       DBIx::Class::ResultSourceHandle - Serializable pointers to ResultSource
       instances

DESCRIPTION
       Currently instances of this class are used to allow proper
       serialization of ResultSources (which may contain unserializable
       elements like "CODE" references).

       Originally this module was used to remove the fixed link between
       Rows/ResultSets and the actual result source objects in order to
       obviate the need of keeping a schema instance constantly in scope,
       while at the same time avoiding leaks due to circular dependencies.
       This is however no longer needed after introduction of a proper mutual-
       assured-destruction contract between a "Schema" instance and its
       "ResultSource" registrants.

METHODS
   new
   resolve
       Resolve the moniker into the actual ResultSource object

   STORABLE_freeze
       Freezes a handle.

   STORABLE_thaw
       Thaws frozen handle. Resets the internal schema reference to the
       package variable $thaw_schema. The recommended way of setting this is
       to use "$schema-&gtthaw($ice)" which handles this for you.
