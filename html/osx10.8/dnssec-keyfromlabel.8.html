NAME
       dnssec-keyfromlabel - DNSSEC key generation tool

SYNOPSIS
       dnssec-keyfromlabel {-l label} [-3] [-a algorithm] [-A date/offset]
			   [-c class] [-D date/offset] [-E engine] [-f flag]
			   [-G] [-I date/offset] [-k] [-K directory]
			   [-n nametype] [-P date/offset] [-p protocol]
			   [-R date/offset] [-t type] [-v level] [-y] {name}

DESCRIPTION
       dnssec-keyfromlabel gets keys with the given label from a crypto
       hardware and builds key files for DNSSEC (Secure DNS), as defined in
       RFC 2535 and RFC 4034.

       The name of the key is specified on the command line. This must match
       the name of the zone for which the key is being generated.

OPTIONS
       -a algorithm
	   Selects the cryptographic algorithm. The value of algorithm must be
	   one of RSAMD5, RSASHA1, DSA, NSEC3RSASHA1, NSEC3DSA, RSASHA256,
	   RSASHA512 or ECCGOST. These values are case insensitive.

	   If no algorithm is specified, then RSASHA1 will be used by default,
	   unless the -3 option is specified, in which case NSEC3RSASHA1 will
	   be used instead. (If -3 is used and an algorithm is specified, that
	   algorithm will be checked for compatibility with NSEC3.)

	   Note 1: that for DNSSEC, RSASHA1 is a mandatory to implement
	   algorithm, and DSA is recommended.

	   Note 2: DH automatically sets the -k flag.

       -3
	   Use an NSEC3-capable algorithm to generate a DNSSEC key. If this
	   option is used and no algorithm is explicitly set on the command
	   line, NSEC3RSASHA1 will be used by default.

       -E engine
	   Specifies the name of the crypto hardware (OpenSSL engine). When
	   compiled with PKCS#11 support it defaults to "pkcs11".

       -l label
	   Specifies the label of the key pair in the crypto hardware. The
	   label may be preceded by an optional OpenSSL engine name, separated
	   by a colon, as in "pkcs11:keylabel".

       -n nametype
	   Specifies the owner type of the key. The value of nametype must
	   either be ZONE (for a DNSSEC zone key (KEY/DNSKEY)), HOST or ENTITY
	   (for a key associated with a host (KEY)), USER (for a key
	   associated with a user(KEY)) or OTHER (DNSKEY). These values are
	   case insensitive.

       -C
	   Compatibility mode: generates an old-style key, without any
	   metadata. By default, dnssec-keyfromlabel will include the key's
	   creation date in the metadata stored with the private key, and
	   other dates may be set there as well (publication date, activation
	   date, etc). Keys that include this data may be incompatible with
	   older versions of BIND; the -C option suppresses them.

       -c class
	   Indicates that the DNS record containing the key should have the
	   specified class. If not specified, class IN is used.

       -f flag
	   Set the specified flag in the flag field of the KEY/DNSKEY record.
	   The only recognized flags are KSK (Key Signing Key) and REVOKE.

       -G
	   Generate a key, but do not publish it or sign with it. This option
	   is incompatible with -P and -A.

       -h
	   Prints a short summary of the options and arguments to
	   dnssec-keyfromlabel.

       -K directory
	   Sets the directory in which the key files are to be written.

       -k
	   Generate KEY records rather than DNSKEY records.

       -p protocol
	   Sets the protocol value for the key. The protocol is a number
	   between 0 and 255. The default is 3 (DNSSEC). Other possible values
	   for this argument are listed in RFC 2535 and its successors.

       -t type
	   Indicates the use of the key.  type must be one of AUTHCONF,
	   NOAUTHCONF, NOAUTH, or NOCONF. The default is AUTHCONF. AUTH refers
	   to the ability to authenticate data, and CONF the ability to
	   encrypt data.

       -v level
	   Sets the debugging level.

       -y
	   Allows DNSSEC key files to be generated even if the key ID would
	   collide with that of an existing key, in the event of either key
	   being revoked. (This is only safe to use if you are sure you won't
	   be using RFC 5011 trust anchor maintenance with either of the keys
	   involved.)

TIMING OPTIONS
       Dates can be expressed in the format YYYYMMDD or YYYYMMDDHHMMSS. If the
       argument begins with a '+' or '-', it is interpreted as an offset from
       the present time. For convenience, if such an offset is followed by one
       of the suffixes 'y', 'mo', 'w', 'd', 'h', or 'mi', then the offset is
       computed in years (defined as 365 24-hour days, ignoring leap years),
       months (defined as 30 24-hour days), weeks, days, hours, or minutes,
       respectively. Without a suffix, the offset is computed in seconds.

       -P date/offset
	   Sets the date on which a key is to be published to the zone. After
	   that date, the key will be included in the zone but will not be
	   used to sign it. If not set, and if the -G option has not been
	   used, the default is "now".

       -A date/offset
	   Sets the date on which the key is to be activated. After that date,
	   the key will be included in the zone and used to sign it. If not
	   set, and if the -G option has not been used, the default is "now".

       -R date/offset
	   Sets the date on which the key is to be revoked. After that date,
	   the key will be flagged as revoked. It will be included in the zone
	   and will be used to sign it.

       -I date/offset
	   Sets the date on which the key is to be retired. After that date,
	   the key will still be included in the zone, but it will not be used
	   to sign it.

       -D date/offset
	   Sets the date on which the key is to be deleted. After that date,
	   the key will no longer be included in the zone. (It may remain in
	   the key repository, however.)

GENERATED KEY FILES
       When dnssec-keyfromlabel completes successfully, it prints a string of
       the form Knnnn.+aaa+iiiii to the standard output. This is an
       identification string for the key files it has generated.

       o   nnnn is the key name.

       o   aaa is the numeric representation of the algorithm.

       o   iiiii is the key identifier (or footprint).

       dnssec-keyfromlabel creates two files, with names based on the printed
       string.	Knnnn.+aaa+iiiii.key contains the public key, and
       Knnnn.+aaa+iiiii.private contains the private key.

       The .key file contains a DNS KEY record that can be inserted into a
       zone file (directly or with a $INCLUDE statement).

       The .private file contains algorithm-specific fields. For obvious
       security reasons, this file does not have general read permission.
