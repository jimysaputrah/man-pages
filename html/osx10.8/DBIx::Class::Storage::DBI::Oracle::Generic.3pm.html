NAME
       DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::Oracle::Generic - Oracle Support for
       DBIx::Class

SYNOPSIS
	 # In your result (table) classes
	 use base 'DBIx::Class::Core';
	 __PACKAGE__->add_columns({ id => { sequence => 'mysequence', auto_nextval => 1 } });
	 __PACKAGE__->set_primary_key('id');

	 # Somewhere in your Code
	 # add some data to a table with a hierarchical relationship
	 $schema->resultset('Person')->create ({
	       firstname => 'foo',
	       lastname => 'bar',
	       children => [
		   {
		       firstname => 'child1',
		       lastname => 'bar',
		       children => [
			   {
			       firstname => 'grandchild',
			       lastname => 'bar',
			   }
		       ],
		   },
		   {
		       firstname => 'child2',
		       lastname => 'bar',
		   },
	       ],
	   });

	 # select from the hierarchical relationship
	 my $rs = $schema->resultset('Person')->search({},
	   {
	     'start_with' => { 'firstname' => 'foo', 'lastname' => 'bar' },
	     'connect_by' => { 'parentid' => { '-prior' => { -ident => 'personid' } },
	     'order_siblings_by' => { -asc => 'name' },
	   };
	 );

	 # this will select the whole tree starting from person "foo bar", creating
	 # following query:
	 # SELECT
	 #     me.persionid me.firstname, me.lastname, me.parentid
	 # FROM
	 #     person me
	 # START WITH
	 #     firstname = 'foo' and lastname = 'bar'
	 # CONNECT BY
	 #     parentid = prior personid
	 # ORDER SIBLINGS BY
	 #     firstname ASC

DESCRIPTION
       This class implements base Oracle support. The subclass
       DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::Oracle::WhereJoins is for "(+)" joins in
       Oracle versions before 9.0.

METHODS
   get_autoinc_seq
       Returns the sequence name for an autoincrement column

   datetime_parser_type
       This sets the proper DateTime::Format module for use with
       DBIx::Class::InflateColumn::DateTime.

   connect_call_datetime_setup
       Used as:

	   on_connect_call => 'datetime_setup'

       In connect_info to set the session nls date, and timestamp values for
       use with DBIx::Class::InflateColumn::DateTime and the necessary
       environment variables for DateTime::Format::Oracle, which is used by
       it.

       Maximum allowable precision is used, unless the environment variables
       have already been set.

       These are the defaults used:

	 $ENV{NLS_DATE_FORMAT}	       ||= 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS';
	 $ENV{NLS_TIMESTAMP_FORMAT}    ||= 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS.FF';
	 $ENV{NLS_TIMESTAMP_TZ_FORMAT} ||= 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS.FF TZHTZM';

       To get more than second precision with
       DBIx::Class::InflateColumn::DateTime for your timestamps, use something
       like this:

	 use Time::HiRes 'time';
	 my $ts = DateTime->from_epoch(epoch => time);

   relname_to_table_alias
       DBIx::Class uses DBIx::Class::Relationship names as table aliases in
       queries.

       Unfortunately, Oracle doesn't support identifiers over 30 chars in
       length, so the DBIx::Class::Relationship name is shortened and appended
       with half of an MD5 hash.

       See "relname_to_table_alias" in DBIx::Class::Storage.

   with_deferred_fk_checks
       Runs a coderef between:

	 alter session set constraints = deferred
	 ...
	 alter session set constraints = immediate

       to defer foreign key checks.

       Constraints must be declared "DEFERRABLE" for this to work.

ATTRIBUTES
       Following additional attributes can be used in resultsets.

   connect_by or connect_by_nocycle
       Value: \%connect_by

       A hashref of conditions used to specify the relationship between parent
       rows and child rows of the hierarchy.

	 connect_by => { parentid => 'prior personid' }

	 # adds a connect by statement to the query:
	 # SELECT
	 #     me.persionid me.firstname, me.lastname, me.parentid
	 # FROM
	 #     person me
	 # CONNECT BY
	 #     parentid = prior persionid


	 connect_by_nocycle => { parentid => 'prior personid' }

	 # adds a connect by statement to the query:
	 # SELECT
	 #     me.persionid me.firstname, me.lastname, me.parentid
	 # FROM
	 #     person me
	 # CONNECT BY NOCYCLE
	 #     parentid = prior persionid

   start_with
       Value: \%condition

       A hashref of conditions which specify the root row(s) of the hierarchy.

       It uses the same syntax as "search" in DBIx::Class::ResultSet

	 start_with => { firstname => 'Foo', lastname => 'Bar' }

	 # SELECT
	 #     me.persionid me.firstname, me.lastname, me.parentid
	 # FROM
	 #     person me
	 # START WITH
	 #     firstname = 'foo' and lastname = 'bar'
	 # CONNECT BY
	 #     parentid = prior persionid

   order_siblings_by
       Value: ($order_siblings_by | \@order_siblings_by)

       Which column(s) to order the siblings by.

       It uses the same syntax as "order_by" in DBIx::Class::ResultSet

	 'order_siblings_by' => 'firstname ASC'

	 # SELECT
	 #     me.persionid me.firstname, me.lastname, me.parentid
	 # FROM
	 #     person me
	 # CONNECT BY
	 #     parentid = prior persionid
	 # ORDER SIBLINGS BY
	 #     firstname ASC
