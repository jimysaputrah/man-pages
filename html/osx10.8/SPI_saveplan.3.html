SPI_SAVEPLAN(3) 	PostgreSQL 9.1.4 Documentation	       SPI_SAVEPLAN(3)



NAME
       SPI_saveplan - save a plan

SYNOPSIS
       SPIPlanPtr SPI_saveplan(SPIPlanPtr plan)

DESCRIPTION
       SPI_saveplan saves a passed plan (prepared by SPI_prepare) in memory
       that will not be freed by SPI_finish nor by the transaction manager,
       and returns a pointer to the saved plan. This gives you the ability to
       reuse prepared plans in the subsequent invocations of your procedure in
       the current session.

ARGUMENTS
       SPIPlanPtr plan
	   the plan to be saved

RETURN VALUE
       Pointer to the saved plan; NULL if unsuccessful. On error, SPI_result
       is set thus:

       SPI_ERROR_ARGUMENT
	   if plan is NULL or invalid

       SPI_ERROR_UNCONNECTED
	   if called from an unconnected procedure

NOTES
       The passed-in plan is not freed, so you might wish to do SPI_freeplan
       on it to avoid leaking memory until SPI_finish.

       If one of the objects (a table, function, etc.) referenced by the
       prepared plan is dropped or redefined, then future executions of
       SPI_execute_plan may fail or return different results than the plan
       initially indicates.
