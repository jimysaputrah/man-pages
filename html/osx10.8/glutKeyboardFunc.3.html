NAME
       glutKeyboardFunc - sets the keyboard callback for the current window.

SYNTAX
       #include &ltGLUT/glut.h&gt

       void glutKeyboardFunc(void (*func)(unsigned char key,
			     int x, int y));

ARGUMENTS
       func	 The new keyboard callback function.

DESCRIPTION
       glutKeyboardFunc  sets  the  keyboard  callback for the current window.
       When a user types into the window, each key press generating  an  ASCII
       character will generate a keyboard callback. The key callback parameter
       is the generated ASCII character. The state of modifier	keys  such  as
       Shift  cannot  be determined directly; their only effect will be on the
       returned ASCII data. The x and y callback parameters indicate the mouse
       location  in window relative coordinates when the key was pressed. When
       a new window is created, no keyboard callback is initially  registered,
       and  ASCII  key	strokes  in  the  window  are ignored. Passing NULL to
       glutKeyboardFunc disables the generation of keyboard callbacks.

       During a keyboard callback, glutGetModifiers may be called to determine
       the  state  of modifier keys when the keystroke generating the callback
       occurred.

       Use glutSpecialFunc for a means to detect non-ASCII key strokes.
