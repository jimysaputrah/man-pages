NAME
       Locale::Maketext::Lexicon::Tie - Use tied hashes as lexicons for
       Maketext

SYNOPSIS
	   package Hello::I18N;
	   use base 'Locale::Maketext';
	   use Locale::Maketext::Lexicon {
	       en => [ Tie => [ DB_File => 'en.db' ] ],
	   };

DESCRIPTION
       This module lets you easily "tie" the %Lexicon hash to a database or
       other data sources.  It takes an array reference of arguments, and
       passes them directly to "tie()".

       Entries will then be fetched whenever it is used; this module does not
       cache them.

       Locale::Maketext, Locale::Maketext::Lexicon
