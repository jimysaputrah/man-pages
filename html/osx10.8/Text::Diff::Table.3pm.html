NAME
	 Text::Diff::Table - Text::Diff plugin to generate "table" format output

SYNOPSIS
	 use Text::Diff;

	 diff \@a, $b { STYLE => "Table" };

DESCRIPTION
       This is a plugin output formatter for Text::Diff that generates "table"
       style diffs:

	 | 6|t/10test.t 		       | 9|t/10test.t			 |
	 +--+----------------------------------+--+------------------------------+

       This format also goes to some pains to highlight "invisible" characters
       on differing elements by selectively escaping whitespace.  Each element
       is split in to three segments (leading whitespace, body, trailing
       whitespace).  If whitespace differs in a segement, that segment is
       whitespace escaped.

       Here is an example of the selective whitespace.

	 +--+--------------------------+--------------------------+
	 |  |demo_ws_A.txt	       |demo_ws_B.txt		  |
	 |  |Fri Dec 21 08:36:32 2001  |Fri Dec 21 08:36:50 2001  |
	 +--+--------------------------+--------------------------+
	 | 1|identical		       |identical		  |
	 * 2|	     spaced in	       |	also spaced in	  *
	 * 3|embedded space	       |embedded	tab	  *
	 | 4|identical		       |identical		  |
	 * 5|	     spaced in	       |\ttabbed in		  *
	 * 6|trailing spaces\s\s\n     |trailing tabs\t\t\n	  *
	 | 7|identical		       |identical		  |
	 * 8|lf line\n		       |crlf line\r\n		  *
	 * 9|embedded ws	       |embedded\tws		  *
	 +--+--------------------------+--------------------------+

       Here's why the lines do or do not have whitespace escaped:

       lines 1, 4, 7 don't differ, no need.
       lines 2, 3 differ in non-whitespace, no need.
       lines 5, 6, 8, 9 all have subtle ws changes.

       Whether or not line 3 should have that tab character escaped is a
       judgement call; so far I'm choosing not to.

UNICODE
       To output the raw unicode chracters consult the documentation of
       Text::Diff::Config. You can set the "DIFF_OUTPUT_UNICODE" environment
       variable to 1 to output it from the command line. For more information,
       consult this bug: <https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=54214> .

LIMITATIONS
       Table formatting requires buffering the entire diff in memory in order
       to calculate column widths.  This format should only be used for
       smaller diffs.

       Assumes tab stops every 8 characters, as $DIETY intended.

       Assumes all character codes >= 127 need to be escaped as hex codes, ie
       that the user's terminal is ASCII, and not even "high bit ASCII",
       capable.  This can be made an option when the need arises.

       Assumes that control codes (character codes 0..31) that don't have
       slash-letter escapes ("\n", "\r", etc) in Perl are best presented as
       hex escapes ("\x01") instead of octal ("\001") or control-code ("\cA")
       escapes.
