DESCRIPTION

     PAM_LOG_DEBUG	 Debugging messages.  These messages are logged with a
			 syslog(3) priority of LOG_DEBUG.

     PAM_LOG_VERBOSE	 Information about the progress of the authentication
			 process, or other non-essential messages.  These mes-
			 sages are logged with a syslog(3) priority of
			 LOG_INFO.

     PAM_LOG_NOTICE	 Messages relating to non-fatal errors.  These mes-
			 sages are logged with a syslog(3) priority of
			 LOG_NOTICE.

     PAM_LOG_ERROR	 Messages relating to serious errors.  These messages
			 are logged with a syslog(3) priority of LOG_ERR.

     The remaining arguments are a printf(3) format string and the correspond-
     ing arguments.
