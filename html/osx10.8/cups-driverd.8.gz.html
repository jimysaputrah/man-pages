NAME
       cups-driverd - cups driver daemon

SYNOPSIS
       cups-driverd cat ppd-name
       cups-driverd list request_id limit options

DESCRIPTION
       cups-driverd  shows  or lists PPD files. It is run in response to CUPS-
       Add-Modify-Printer  or  CUPS-Get-Devices  requests.   The  first   form
       ("cups-driverd  cat ppd-name") writes the named PPD file to stdout. The
       output format is an uncompressed PPD file.

       The second form lists the available manufacturers or PPD files to  std-
       out  as	indicated by the options argument. The output format is an IPP
       response message. The request_id argument is the request  ID  from  the
       original  IPP  request,	typically  1.  The limit argument is the limit
       value from the original IPP request - 0 means no  limit.  Finally,  the
       options	argument  is a space-delimited list of attributes ("name=value
       name=value ...") that were passed in with the request. Currently  cups-
       driverd	looks for the ppd-make and requested-attributes attributes and
       tailors the output accordingly.

DRIVERS
       Drivers can be static PPD files under the /usr/share/cups/model	direc-
       tory  or  programs under the /usr/libexec/cups/driver directory. Static
       PPD files must conform to the Adobe PPD File Format Specification  ver-
       sion  4.3  and may be compressed using the gzip(1) program. Driver pro-
       grams must implement the command-line interface shown in the next  sec-
       tion.

   DRIVER PROGRAMS
       Driver  programs  provide  a   interface  to  dynamically-generated PPD
       files. The following arguments are currently defined:

       drivername list
	    Lists the supported PPD files to stdout.

       drivername cat ppdname
	    Writes the named PPD file to stdout.

       Driver programs MUST NOT query hardware or make other long-term	opera-
       tions  that would delay the return of a driver list. See the NOTES sec-
       tion below for specific recommendations.

   LISTING FILES (drivername list)
       When run with the single argument "list", the  program  must  list  the
       available  PPD files it can generate to stdout using the following for-
       mat:
	   "drivername:ppdname" language "make" "make and model"
	   "drivername:ppdname" language "make" "make and model" "1284 device id"
	   "drivername:ppdname" language "make" "make and model" "1284 device id" "(PPD product)"
	   "drivername:ppdname" language "make" "make and model" "1284 device id" "(PPD product)" "PostScript version"
	   "drivername:ppdname" language "make" "make and model" "1284 device id" "(PPD product)" "PostScript version" "type"

       Drivername is the name of the driver program. Ppdname is the name  used
       to  select the given driver. Language is the locale associated with the
       default language of the PPD file, typically "en". Make is the  Manufac-
       turer  name from the PPD file. Make and model is the NickName name from
       the PPD file. 1284 device id is the 1284DeviceId from the PPD file,  if
       any.  (PPD product) is the Product string as it would appear in the PPD
       file or from a PostScript query. PostScript version  is	the  PSVersion
       string  as  it would appear in the PPD file or from a PostScript query.
       Type is "postscript" for PostScript printers, "pdf" for	PDF  printers,
       "raster" for raster printers, or "fax" for facsimile devices.

   WRITING FILES (drivername cat ppdname)
       When  the  driver  program  is run with the "cat ppdname" arguments, it
       must write the named PPD file to stdout, uncompressed. If the named PPD
       file  does  not	exist, the driver program must not write any output to
       stdout and report the error to stderr instead.

   DRIVER ERROR MESSAGES
       Error messages can be relayed back to cupsd by writing them to  stderr.
       The following prefixes are recognized:

       DEBUG: [drivername]
	    Debugging messages

       ERROR: [drivername]
	    Error messages

       INFO: [drivername]
	    Informational messages

NOTES
       Due to performance considerations, driver programs have been officially
       deprecated and should not be used for new development.  Currently  only
       the  CUPS  web  interface and lpinfo(8) command will request lists from
       all driver programs.
