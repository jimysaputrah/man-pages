NAME
       sasl_server_new - Create a new server authentication object



SYNOPSIS
       #include <sasl/sasl.h>

       int sasl_server_new(const char *service,
		       const char *serverFQDN,
		       const char *user_realm,
		       const char *iplocalport,
		       const char *ipremoteport,
		       const sasl_callback_t *callbacks,
		       unsigned flags,
		       sasl_conn_t ** pconn);


DESCRIPTION
       sasl_server_new() creates a new SASL context. This context will be used
       for all SASL calls for one connection. It handles  both	authentication
       and integrity/encyption layers after authentication.

       service	is  the  registered  name of the service (usually the protocol
       name) using SASL (e.g. "imap").

       serverFQDN is the fully qualified server domain name.  NULL  means  use
       gethostname().  This is useful for multi-homed servers.

       user_realm  is the domain of the user agent. This is usually not neces-
       sary (NULL is default)

       iplocalport is the IP and port of the local side of the connection,  or
       NULL.   If  iplocalport is NULL it will disable mechanisms that require
       IP address information.	This strings must be in one of	the  following
       formats:   "a.b.c.d;port"  (IPv4),  "e:f:g:h:i:j:k:l;port"  (IPv6),  or
       "e:f:g:h:i:j:a.b.c.d;port" (IPv6)

       ipremoteport is the IP and port of the remote side of  the  connection,
       or NULL (see iplocalport)

       flags are connection flags (see below)

       pconn  is  a pointer to the conection context allocated by the library.
       This structure will be used for all future SASL calls for this  connec-
       tion.


       Connection Flags

       SASL_SUCCESS_DATA
	       The protocol supports a server-last send

       SASL_NEED_PROXY
	       Force  the use of a mechanism that supports an authorization id
	       that is not the authentication id.


RETURN VALUE
       sasl_server_new() returns an integer which corresponds to  one  of  the
       SASL  error  codes. SASL_OK is the only one that indicates success. All
       others indicate errors and should either be handled or the  authentica-
       tion session should be quit.


CONFORMING TO
       RFC 2222
