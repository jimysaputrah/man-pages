NAME
       glPolygonMode - select a polygon rasterization mode


C SPECIFICATION
       void glPolygonMode( GLenum face,
			   GLenum mode )


PARAMETERS
       face  Specifies	the  polygons  that mode applies to.  Must be GL_FRONT
	     for front-facing polygons, GL_BACK for back-facing  polygons,  or
	     GL_FRONT_AND_BACK for front- and back-facing polygons.

       mode  Specifies	how  polygons will be rasterized.  Accepted values are
	     GL_POINT, GL_LINE, and GL_FILL.  The initial value is GL_FILL for
	     both front- and back-facing polygons.

DESCRIPTION
       glPolygonMode  controls	the  interpretation of polygons for rasteriza-
       tion.  face describes which  polygons  mode  applies  to:  front-facing
       polygons   (GL_FRONT),  back-facing  polygons  (GL_BACK),  or  both  (-
       GL_FRONT_AND_BACK).  The polygon mode affects only the final rasteriza-
       tion  of polygons.  In particular, a polygon's vertices are lit and the
       polygon is clipped and possibly culled before these modes are  applied.

       Three modes are defined and can be specified in mode:

       GL_POINT      Polygon vertices that are marked as the start of a bound-
		     ary edge are drawn as points.  Point attributes  such  as
		     GL_POINT_SIZE  and GL_POINT_SMOOTH control the rasteriza-
		     tion of the  points.   Polygon  rasterization  attributes
		     other than GL_POLYGON_MODE have no effect.

       GL_LINE	     Boundary edges of the polygon are drawn as line segments.
		     They are treated as  connected  line  segments  for  line
		     stippling;  the  line stipple counter and pattern are not
		     reset  between  segments	(see   glLineStipple).	  Line
		     attributes  such as GL_LINE_WIDTH and GL_LINE_SMOOTH con-
		     trol the rasterization of the lines.  Polygon  rasteriza-
		     tion   attributes	other  than  GL_POLYGON_MODE  have  no
		     effect.

       GL_FILL	     The  interior  of	the  polygon   is   filled.    Polygon
		     attributes     such     as     GL_POLYGON_STIPPLE	   and
		     GL_POLYGON_SMOOTH control the rasterization of the  poly-
		     gon.

EXAMPLES
       To  draw a surface with filled back-facing polygons and outlined front-
       facing polygons, call glPolygonMode(GL_FRONT, GL_LINE);

NOTES
       Vertices are marked as boundary or nonboundary with an edge flag.  Edge
       flags  are  generated internally by the GL when it decomposes polygons;
       they can be set explicitly using glEdgeFlag.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if either face or mode is not an  accepted
       value.

       GL_INVALID_OPERATION  is generated if glPolygonMode is executed between
       the execution of glBegin and the corresponding execution of glEnd.
