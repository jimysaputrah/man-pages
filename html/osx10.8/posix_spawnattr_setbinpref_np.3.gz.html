POSIX_SPAWNATTR_SETBI... BSD Library Functions Manual POSIX_SPAWNATTR_SETBI...

NAME
     posix_spawnattr_setbinpref_np posix_spawnattr_getbinpref_np -- set or get
     the spawn-binpref attribute on a posix_spawnattr_t

SYNOPSIS
     #include &ltspawn.h&gt

     int
     posix_spawnattr_setbinpref_np(posix_spawnattr_t *restrict attr,
	 size_t count, cpu_type_t *pref, size_t *restrict ocount);

     int
     posix_spawnattr_getbinpref_np(const posix_spawnattr_t *restrict attr,
	 size_t count, cpu_type_t *pref, size_t * restrict ocount);

IMPORTANT
     These functions represent an Apple extension to posix_spawn(2) and
     posix_spawnp(2), and as such should not be used by programs intending
     their code to be portable to other platforms.

DESCRIPTION
     The posix_spawnattr_setbinpref_np() function sets the universal binary
     preferences for the spawn attribute value referenced by attr from the
     memory containing the cpu_type_t referenced by pref with a size of count
     elements; the actual number of elements that are set in the attribute is
     returned in ocount.

     When spawn(2) or spawnp(2) is subsequently invoked on a Universal binary
     with the posix_spawnattr_t, the elements which were set will be used, in
     the order they were set, to select the first element in the list which
     matches any cpu_type_t of those available in the Universal binary.  If
     there is no match, then the attempt to create the child process will fail
     with the error EBADARCH.  If the cpu_type_t CPU_TYPE_ANY is the last ele-
     ment in the list, then rather than returning EBADARCH on no match, the
     system will instead fall back to the standard Universal binary grading
     preference order.

     The posix_spawnattr_getbinpref_np() function gets the universal binary
     preferences for the spawn attribute value referenced by attr into the
     memory containing the cpu_type_t referenced by pref with a prereserved
     size of count elements; the actual number of elements that are copied
     from the attribute is returned in ocount.

RETURN VALUES
     On success, these functions return 0; on failure they return an error
     number from &lterrno.h&gt and modify the value of ocount.  Additionally, if
     successful, posix_spawnattr_getbinpref_np() will modify the contents of
     the pref array with the current attribute values.

ERRORS
     These functions may fail if:

     [EINVAL]		The value specified by attr is invalid.

     [EINVAL]		The value of attr is invalid.
