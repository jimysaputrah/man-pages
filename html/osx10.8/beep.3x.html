NAME
       beep, flash - curses bell and screen flash routines

SYNOPSIS
       #include &ltcurses.h&gt

       int beep(void);
       int flash(void);

DESCRIPTION
       The  beep  and flash routines are used to alert the terminal user.  The
       routine beep sounds an audible alarm on the terminal, if possible; oth-
       erwise it flashes the screen (visible bell).  The routine flash flashes
       the screen, and if that is not possible, sounds the alert.  If  neither
       alert is possible, nothing happens.  Nearly all terminals have an audi-
       ble alert (bell or beep), but only some can flash the screen.

RETURN VALUE
       These routines return OK if they succeed in beeping  or	flashing,  ERR
       otherwise.

EXTENSIONS
       SVr4's beep and flash routines always returned OK, so it was not possi-
       ble to tell when the beep or flash failed.

PORTABILITY
       These functions are described in the  XSI  Curses  standard,  Issue  4.
       Like SVr4, it specifies that they always return OK.
