NAME
       ALTER_OPERATOR_FAMILY - change the definition of an operator family

SYNOPSIS
       ALTER OPERATOR FAMILY name USING index_method ADD
	 {  OPERATOR strategy_number operator_name ( op_type, op_type ) [ FOR SEARCH | FOR ORDER BY sort_family_name ]
	  | FUNCTION support_number [ ( op_type [ , op_type ] ) ] function_name ( argument_type [, ...] )
	 } [, ... ]
       ALTER OPERATOR FAMILY name USING index_method DROP
	 {  OPERATOR strategy_number ( op_type [ , op_type ] )
	  | FUNCTION support_number ( op_type [ , op_type ] )
	 } [, ... ]
       ALTER OPERATOR FAMILY name USING index_method RENAME TO new_name
       ALTER OPERATOR FAMILY name USING index_method OWNER TO new_owner
       ALTER OPERATOR FAMILY name USING index_method SET SCHEMA new_schema

DESCRIPTION
       ALTER OPERATOR FAMILY changes the definition of an operator family. You
       can add operators and support functions to the family, remove them from
       the family, or change the family's name or owner.

       When operators and support functions are added to a family with ALTER
       OPERATOR FAMILY, they are not part of any specific operator class
       within the family, but are just "loose" within the family. This
       indicates that these operators and functions are compatible with the
       family's semantics, but are not required for correct functioning of any
       specific index. (Operators and functions that are so required should be
       declared as part of an operator class, instead; see CREATE OPERATOR
       CLASS (CREATE_OPERATOR_CLASS(7)).)  PostgreSQL will allow loose members
       of a family to be dropped from the family at any time, but members of
       an operator class cannot be dropped without dropping the whole class
       and any indexes that depend on it. Typically, single-data-type
       operators and functions are part of operator classes because they are
       needed to support an index on that specific data type, while
       cross-data-type operators and functions are made loose members of the
       family.

       You must be a superuser to use ALTER OPERATOR FAMILY. (This restriction
       is made because an erroneous operator family definition could confuse
       or even crash the server.)


       ALTER OPERATOR FAMILY does not presently check whether the operator
       family definition includes all the operators and functions required by
       the index method, nor whether the operators and functions form a
       self-consistent set. It is the user's responsibility to define a valid
       operator family.

       Refer to Section 35.14, "Interfacing Extensions To Indexes", in the
       documentation for further information.

PARAMETERS
       name
	   The name (optionally schema-qualified) of an existing operator
	   family.

       index_method
	   The name of the index method this operator family is for.

       strategy_number
	   The index method's strategy number for an operator associated with
	   the operator family.

       operator_name
	   The name (optionally schema-qualified) of an operator associated
	   with the operator family.

       op_type
	   In an OPERATOR clause, the operand data type(s) of the operator, or
	   NONE to signify a left-unary or right-unary operator. Unlike the
	   comparable syntax in CREATE OPERATOR CLASS, the operand data types
	   must always be specified.

	   In an ADD FUNCTION clause, the operand data type(s) the function is
	   intended to support, if different from the input data type(s) of
	   the function. For B-tree and hash indexes it is not necessary to
	   specify op_type since the function's input data type(s) are always
	   the correct ones to use. For GIN and GiST indexes it is necessary
	   to specify the input data type the function is to be used with.

	   In a DROP FUNCTION clause, the operand data type(s) the function is
	   intended to support must be specified.

       sort_family_name
	   The name (optionally schema-qualified) of an existing btree
	   operator family that describes the sort ordering associated with an
	   ordering operator.

	   If neither FOR SEARCH nor FOR ORDER BY is specified, FOR SEARCH is
	   the default.

       support_number
	   The index method's support procedure number for a function
	   associated with the operator family.

       function_name
	   The name (optionally schema-qualified) of a function that is an
	   index method support procedure for the operator family.

       argument_type
	   The parameter data type(s) of the function.

       new_name
	   The new name of the operator family.

       new_owner
	   The new owner of the operator family.

       new_schema
	   The new schema for the operator family.

       The OPERATOR and FUNCTION clauses can appear in any order.

NOTES
       Notice that the DROP syntax only specifies the "slot" in the operator
       family, by strategy or support number and input data type(s). The name
       of the operator or function occupying the slot is not mentioned. Also,
       for DROP FUNCTION the type(s) to specify are the input data type(s) the
       function is intended to support; for GIN and GiST indexes this might
       have nothing to do with the actual input argument types of the
       function.

       Because the index machinery does not check access permissions on
       functions before using them, including a function or operator in an
       operator family is tantamount to granting public execute permission on
       it. This is usually not an issue for the sorts of functions that are
       useful in an operator family.

       The operators should not be defined by SQL functions. A SQL function is
       likely to be inlined into the calling query, which will prevent the
       optimizer from recognizing that the query matches an index.

       Before PostgreSQL 8.4, the OPERATOR clause could include a RECHECK
       option. This is no longer supported because whether an index operator
       is "lossy" is now determined on-the-fly at run time. This allows
       efficient handling of cases where an operator might or might not be
       lossy.

EXAMPLES
       The following example command adds cross-data-type operators and
       support functions to an operator family that already contains B-tree
       operator classes for data types int4 and int2.

	   ALTER OPERATOR FAMILY integer_ops USING btree ADD

	     -- int4 vs int2
	     OPERATOR 1 &lt (int4, int2) ,
	     OPERATOR 2 &lt= (int4, int2) ,
	     OPERATOR 3 = (int4, int2) ,
	     OPERATOR 4 &gt= (int4, int2) ,
	     OPERATOR 5 &gt (int4, int2) ,
	     FUNCTION 1 btint42cmp(int4, int2) ,

	     -- int2 vs int4
	     OPERATOR 1 &lt (int2, int4) ,
	     OPERATOR 2 &lt= (int2, int4) ,
	     OPERATOR 3 = (int2, int4) ,
	     OPERATOR 4 &gt= (int2, int4) ,
	     OPERATOR 5 &gt (int2, int4) ,
	     FUNCTION 1 btint24cmp(int2, int4) ;

       To remove these entries again:

	   ALTER OPERATOR FAMILY integer_ops USING btree DROP

	     -- int4 vs int2
	     OPERATOR 1 (int4, int2) ,
	     OPERATOR 2 (int4, int2) ,
	     OPERATOR 3 (int4, int2) ,
	     OPERATOR 4 (int4, int2) ,
	     OPERATOR 5 (int4, int2) ,
	     FUNCTION 1 (int4, int2) ,

	     -- int2 vs int4
	     OPERATOR 1 (int2, int4) ,
	     OPERATOR 2 (int2, int4) ,
	     OPERATOR 3 (int2, int4) ,
	     OPERATOR 4 (int2, int4) ,
	     OPERATOR 5 (int2, int4) ,
	     FUNCTION 1 (int2, int4) ;

COMPATIBILITY
       There is no ALTER OPERATOR FAMILY statement in the SQL standard.
