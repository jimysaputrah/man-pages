NAME
       DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::Replicated::Replicant - A replicated DBI
       Storage Role

SYNOPSIS
       This class is used internally by DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::Replicated.

DESCRIPTION
       Replicants are DBI Storages that follow a master DBI Storage.
       Typically this is accomplished via an external replication system.
       Please see the documents for DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::Replicated for
       more details.

       This class exists to define methods of a DBI Storage that only make
       sense when it's a classic 'slave' in a pool of slave databases which
       replicate from a given master database.

ATTRIBUTES
       This class defines the following attributes.

   active
       This is a boolean which allows you to programmatically activate or
       deactivate a replicant from the pool.  This way you can do stuff like
       disallow a replicant when it gets too far behind the master, if it
       stops replicating, etc.

       This attribute DOES NOT reflect a replicant's internal status, i.e. if
       it is properly replicating from a master and has not fallen too many
       seconds behind a reliability threshold.	For that, use "is_replicating"
       and "lag_behind_master".  Since the implementation of those functions
       database specific (and not all DBIC supported DBs support replication)
       you should refer your database-specific storage driver for more
       information.

   master
       Reference to the master Storage.

METHODS
       This class defines the following methods.

   debugobj
       Override the debugobj method to redirect this method call back to the
       master.
