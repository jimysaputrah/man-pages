NAME
       ipptool - perform internet printing protocol requests

SYNOPSIS
       ipptool [ -4 ] [ -6 ] [ -C ] [ -E ] [ -I ] [ -L ] [ -S ] [ -T seconds ]
       [ -V version ] [ -X ] [ -c ] [ -d name=value ] [ -f  filename  ]  [  -i
       seconds	]  [ -n repeat-count ] [ -q ] [ -t ] [ -v ] URI filename [ ...
       filenameN ]

DESCRIPTION
       ipptool sends IPP requests to the specified URI and tests  and/or  dis-
       plays  the  results.  Each  named  file	defines  one or more requests,
       including the expected response status, attributes, and values.	Output
       is either a plain text, formatted text, CSV, or XML report on the stan-
       dard output, with a non-zero exit status indicating that  one  or  more
       tests have failed. The file format is described in ipptoolfile(5).

OPTIONS
       The following options are recognized by ipptool:

       -4   Specifies that ipptool must connect to the printer or server using
	    IPv4.

       -6   Specifies that ipptool must connect to the printer or server using
	    IPv6.

       -C   Specifies  that requests should be sent using the HTTP/1.1 "Trans-
	    fer-Encoding: chunked" header, which is required  for  conformance
	    by	all versions of IPP. The default is to use "Transfer-Encoding:
	    chunked" for requests with attached  files	and  "Content-Length:"
	    for requests without attached files.

       -E   Forces TLS encryption when connecting to the server using the HTTP
	    "Upgrade" header.

       -I   Specifies that ipptool will continue past errors.

       -L   Specifies that requests should be sent using  the  HTTP/1.0  "Con-
	    tent-Length:"  header,  which  is  required for conformance by all
	    versions of IPP. The default is to use  "Transfer-Encoding:  chun-
	    ked"  for  requests  with attached files and "Content-Length:" for
	    requests without attached files.

       -S   Forces (dedicated) SSL encryption when connecting to the server.

       -T seconds
	    Specifies a timeout for IPP requests in seconds.

       -V version
	    Specifies the default IPP version to use: 1.0, 1.1, 2.0,  2.1,  or
	    2.2. If not specified, version 1.1 is used.

       -X   Specifies  that XML (Apple plist) output is desired instead of the
	    plain text report. This option is incompatible with the -i (inter-
	    val) and -n (repeat-count) options.

       -c   Specifies  that  CSV  (comma-separated  values)  output is desired
	    instead of the plain text output.

       -d name=value
	    Defines the named variable.

       -f filename
	    Defines the default request filename for tests.

       -i seconds
	    Specifies that the (last) file should be repeated at the specified
	    interval.  This option is incompatible with the -X (XML plist out-
	    put) option.

       -l   Specifies that plain text output is desired.

       -n repeat-count
	    Specifies that the (last) file should be  repeated	the  specified
	    number  of	times.	This  option  is incompatible with the -X (XML
	    plist output) option.

       -t   Specifies that CUPS test report output is desired instead  of  the
	    plain text output.

       -v   Specifies  that all request and response attributes should be out-
	    put in CUPS test mode (-t). This is the default for XML output.

COMPATIBILITY
       The ipptool program is unique to CUPS.
