NAME
       PPI::Statement::Unknown - An unknown or transient statement

INHERITANCE
	 PPI::Statement::Unknown
	 isa PPI::Statement
	     isa PPI::Node
		 isa PPI::Element

DESCRIPTION
       The "PPI::Statement::Unknown" class is used primarily during the lexing
       process to hold elements that are known to be statement, but for which
       the exact "type" of statement is as yet unknown, and requires further
       tokens in order to resolve the correct type.

       They should not exist in a fully parse valid document, and if any
       exists they indicate either a problem in Document, or possibly (by
       allowing it to get through unresolved) a bug in PPI::Lexer.

METHODS
       "PPI::Statement::Unknown" has no additional methods beyond the default
       ones provided by PPI::Statement, PPI::Node and PPI::Element.

SUPPORT
       See the support section in the main module.
