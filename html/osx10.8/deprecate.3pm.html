NAME
       deprecate - Perl pragma for deprecating the core version of a module

SYNOPSIS
	   use deprecate;      # always deprecate the module in which this occurs

	   use if $] &gt 5.010, 'deprecate';     # conditionally deprecate the module

DESCRIPTION
       This module is used using "use deprecate;" (or something that calls
       "deprecate-&gtimport()", for example "use if COND, deprecate;").

       If the module that includes "use deprecate" is located in a core
       library directory, a deprecation warning is issued, encouraging the
       user to use the version on CPAN.  If that module is located in a site
       library, it is the CPAN version, and no warning is issued.

   EXPORT
       None by default.  The only method is "import", called by "use
       deprecate;".

SEE ALSO
       First example to "use deprecate;" was Switch.
