NAME
       slapd-mdb - Memory-Mapped DB backend to slapd

SYNOPSIS
       /etc/openldap/slapd.conf

DESCRIPTION
       The  mdb backend to slapd(8) uses OpenLDAP's own Memory-Mapped DB (MDB)
       library to store data.  It relies completely on the underlying  operat-
       ing system for memory management and does no caching of its own.

       The mdb backend is similar to the hdb backend in that it uses a hierar-
       chical database layout which supports subtree renames. It is both  more
       space-efficient	and  more  execution-efficient	than  the bdb backend,
       while being overall much simpler to manage.

CONFIGURATION
       These slapd.conf options apply to the mdb backend database.   That  is,
       they  must  follow a "database mdb" line and come before any subsequent
       "backend" or "database" lines.  Other database options are described in
       the slapd.conf(5) manual page.

       checkpoint &ltkbyte&gt &ltmin&gt
	      Specify  the  frequency  for flushing the database disk buffers.
	      This setting is only needed if the dbnosync option is used.  The
	      checkpoint will occur if either &ltkbyte&gt data has been written or
	      &ltmin&gt minutes have passed since the last checkpoint.  Both argu-
	      ments  default to zero, in which case they are ignored. When the
	      &ltmin&gt argument is non-zero, an  internal	task  will  run  every
	      &ltmin&gt  minutes  to  perform the checkpoint.  Note: currently the
	      &ltkbyte&gt setting is unimplemented.

       dbnosync
	      Specify that on-disk database contents should not be immediately
	      synchronized  with  in memory changes.  Enabling this option may
	      improve performance at the expense of data security. In particu-
	      lar, if the operating system crashes before changes are flushed,
	      some number of transactions may be lost.	 By  default,  a  full
	      data flush/sync is performed when each transaction is committed.

       directory &ltdirectory&gt
	      Specify the directory where the MDB files containing this  data-
	      base  and associated indexes live.  A separate directory must be
	      specified for each  database.   The  default  is	/var/db/openl-
	      dap/openldap-data.

       index {&ltattrlist&gt|default} [pres,eq,approx,sub,&ltspecial&gt]
	      Specify the indexes to maintain for the given attribute (or list
	      of attributes).	Some  attributes  only	support  a  subset  of
	      indexes.	 If only an &ltattr&gt is given, the indices specified for
	      default are maintained.  Note that setting a  default  does  not
	      imply  that  all attributes will be indexed. Also, for best per-
	      formance, an eq  index  should  always  be  configured  for  the
	      objectClass attribute.

	      A  number  of  special  index  parameters may be specified.  The
	      index type sub can be decomposed	into  subinitial,  subany, and
	      subfinal	indices.   The special type nolang may be specified to
	      disallow use of this index by language  subtypes.   The  special
	      type  nosubtypes	may be specified to disallow use of this index
	      by  named  subtypes.    Note:   changing	 index	 settings   in
	      slapd.conf(5)  requires  rebuilding  indices,  see slapindex(8);
	      changing index settings dynamically by LDAPModifying "cn=config"
	      automatically causes rebuilding of the indices online in a back-
	      ground task.

       maxreaders &ltinteger&gt
	      Specify the maximum number of threads that may  have  concurrent
	      read  access  to	the database. Tools such as slapcat count as a
	      single thread, in addition to threads in any active  slapd  pro-
	      cesses. The default is 126.

       maxsize &ltbytes&gt
	      Specify  the maximum size of the database in bytes. A memory map
	      of this size is allocated at startup time and the database  will
	      not be allowed to grow beyond this size. The default is 10485760
	      bytes. This setting may be  changed  upward  if  the  configured
	      limit needs to be increased.

	      Note:  It is important to set this to as large a value as possi-
	      ble, (relative to anticipated growth of  the  actual  data  over
	      time) since growing the size later may not be practical when the
	      system is under heavy load.

       mode &ltinteger&gt
	      Specify the file protection mode	that  newly  created  database
	      files should have.  The default is 0600.

       searchstack &ltdepth&gt
	      Specify  the  depth  of the stack used for search filter evalua-
	      tion.  Search filters are evaluated on a	stack  to  accommodate
	      nested AND / OR clauses. An individual stack is assigned to each
	      server thread.  The depth of the stack determines how complex  a
	      filter  can be evaluated without requiring any additional memory
	      allocation. Filters that are nested deeper than the search stack
	      depth  will cause a separate stack to be allocated for that par-
	      ticular search operation. These allocations  can	have  a  major
	      negative	impact	on server performance, but specifying too much
	      stack will also consume a great deal  of	memory.   Each	search
	      stack  uses 512K bytes per level. The default stack depth is 16,
	      thus 8MB per thread is used.

ACCESS CONTROL
       The mdb	backend  honors  access  control  semantics  as  indicated  in
       slapd.access(5).

NOTES
       This  is an early release; the database file format or other character-
       istics may change incompatibly in future releases.
