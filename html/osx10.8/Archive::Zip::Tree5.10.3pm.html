NAME
       Archive::Zip::Tree - (DEPRECATED) methods for adding/extracting trees
       using Archive::Zip

SYNOPSIS
DESCRIPTION
       This module is deprecated, because all its methods were moved into the
       main Archive::Zip module.

       It is included in the distribution merely to avoid breaking old code.

       See Archive::Zip.
