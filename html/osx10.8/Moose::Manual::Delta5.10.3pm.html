NAME
       Moose::Manual::Delta - Important Changes in Moose

DESCRIPTION
       This documents any important or noteworthy changes in Moose, with a
       focus on backwards. This does duplicate data from the Changes file, but
       aims to provide more details and when possible workarounds.

       Besides helping keep up with changes, you can also use this document
       for finding the lowest version of Moose that supported a given feature.
       If you encounter a problem and have a solution but don't see it
       documented here, or think we missed an important feature, please send
       us a patch.

1.00
       Moose::Meta::Attribute::Native::Trait::Code no longer creates reader
       methods by default
	   Earlier versions of Moose::Meta::Attribute::Native::Trait::Code
	   created read-only accessors for the attributes it's been applied
	   to, even if you didn't ask for it with "is => 'ro'". This incorrect
	   behaviour has now been fixed.

0.95
       Moose::Util add_method_modifier behavior
	   add_method_modifier (and subsequently the sugar functions
	   Moose::before, Moose::after, and Moose::around) can now accept
	   arrayrefs, with the same behavior as lists. Types other than
	   arrayref and regexp result in an error.

0.93_01 and 0.94
       Moose::Util::MetaRole API has changed
	   The "apply_metaclass_roles" function is now called
	   "apply_metaroles". The way arguments are supplied has been changed
	   to force you to distinguish between metaroles applied to
	   Moose::Meta::Class (and helpers) versus Moose::Meta::Role.

	   The old API still works, but will warn in a future release, and
	   eventually be removed.

       Moose::Meta::Role has real attributes
	   The attributes returned by Moose::Meta::Role are now instances of
	   the Moose::Meta::Role::Attribute class, instead of bare hash
	   references.

       "no Moose" now removes "blessed" and "confess"
	   Moose is now smart enough to know exactly what it exported, even
	   when it re-exports functions from other packages. When you unimport
	   Moose, it will remove these functions from your namespace unless
	   you also imported them directly from their respective packages.

	   If you have a "no Moose" in your code before you call "blessed" or
	   "confess", your code will break. You can either move the "no Moose"
	   call later in your code, or explicitly import the relevant
	   functions from the packages that provide them.

       Moose::Exporter is smarter about unimporting re-exports
	   The change above comes from a general improvement to
	   Moose::Exporter. It will now unimport any function it exports, even
	   if that function is a re-export from another package.

       Attributes in roles can no longer override class attributes with "+foo"
	   Previously, this worked more or less accidentally, because role
	   attributes weren't objects. This was never documented, but a few
	   MooseX modules took advantage of this.

       The composition_class_roles attribute in Moose::Meta::Role is now a
       method
	   This was done to make it possible for roles to alter the the list
	   of composition class roles by applying a method modifiers.
	   Previously, this was an attribute and MooseX modules override it.
	   Since that no longer works, this was made a method.

	   This should be an attribute, so this may switch back to being an
	   attribute in the future if we can figure out how to make this work.

0.93
       Calling $object->new() is no longer deprecated
	   We decided to undeprecate this. Now it just works.

       Both "get_method_map" and "get_attribute_map" is deprecated
	   These metaclass methods were never meant to be public, and they are
	   both now deprecated. The work around if you still need the
	   functionality they provided is to iterate over the list of names
	   manually.

	       my %fields = map { $_ => $meta->get_attribute($_) } $meta->get_attribute_list;

	   This was actually a change in Class::MOP, but this version of Moose
	   requires a version of Class::MOP that includes said change.

0.90
       Added Native delegation for Code refs
	   See Moose::Meta::Attribute::Native::Trait::Code for details.

       Calling $object->new() is deprecated
	   Moose has long supported this, but it's never really been
	   documented, and we don't think this is a good practice. If you want
	   to construct an object from an existing object, you should provide
	   some sort of alternate constructor like "$object->clone".

	   Calling "$object->new" now issues a warning, and will be an error
	   in a future release.

       Moose no longer warns if you call "make_immutable" for a class with
       mutable ancestors
	   While in theory this is a good thing to warn about, we found so
	   many exceptions to this that doing this properly became quite
	   problematic.

Version 0.89_02
       New Native delegation methods from List::Util and List::MoreUtils
	   In particular, we now have "reduce", "shuffle", "uniq", and
	   "natatime".

       The Moose::Exporter with_caller feature is now deprecated
	   Use "with_meta" instead. The "with_caller" option will start
	   warning in a future release.

       Moose now warns if you call "make_immutable" for a class with mutable
       ancestors
	   This is dangerous because modifying a class after a subclass has
	   been immutabilized will lead to incorrect results in the subclass,
	   due to inlining, caching, etc. This occasionally happens
	   accidentally, when a class loads one of its subclasses in the
	   middle of its class definition, so pointing out that this may cause
	   issues should be helpful. Metaclasses (classes that inherit from
	   Class::MOP::Object) are currently exempt from this check, since at
	   the moment we aren't very consistent about which metaclasses we
	   immutabilize.

       "enum" and "duck_type" now take arrayrefs for all forms
	   Previously, calling these functions with a list would take the
	   first element of the list as the type constraint name, and use the
	   remainder as the enum values or method names. This makes the
	   interface inconsistent with the anon-type forms of these functions
	   (which must take an arrayref), and a free-form list where the first
	   value is sometimes special is hard to validate (and harder to give
	   reasonable error messages for). These functions have been changed
	   to take arrayrefs in all their forms - so, "enum 'My::Type' =>
	   [qw(foo bar)]" is now the preferred way to create an enum type
	   constraint. The old syntax still works for now, but it will
	   hopefully be deprecated and removed in a future release.

Version 0.89_01
       Moose::Meta::Attribute::Native has been moved into the Moose core from
       MooseX::AttributeHelpers.  Major changes include:

       "traits", not "metaclass"
	   Method providers are only available via traits.

       "handles", not "provides" or "curries"
	   The "provides" syntax was like core Moose "handles => HASHREF"
	   syntax, but with the keys and values reversed.  This was confusing,
	   and AttributeHelpers now uses "handles => HASHREF" in a way that
	   should be intuitive to anyone already familiar with how it is used
	   for other attributes.

	   The "curries" functionality provided by AttributeHelpers has been
	   generalized to apply to all cases of "handles => HASHREF", though
	   not every piece of functionality has been ported (currying with a
	   CODEREF is not supported).

       "empty" is now "is_empty", and means empty, not non-empty
	   Previously, the "empty" method provided by Arrays and Hashes
	   returned true if the attribute was not empty (no elements).	Now it
	   returns true if the attribute is empty. It was also renamed to
	   "is_empty", to reflect this.

       "find" was renamed to "first", and "first" and "last" were removed
	   List::Util refers to the functionality that we used to provide
	   under "find" as first, so that will likely be more familiar (and
	   will fit in better if we decide to add more List::Util functions).
	   "first" and "last" were removed, since their functionality is
	   easily duplicated with curries of "get".

       Helpers that take a coderef of one argument now use $_
	   Subroutines passed as the first argument to "first", "map", and
	   "grep" now receive their argument in $_ rather than as a parameter
	   to the subroutine.  Helpers that take a coderef of two or more
	   arguments remain using the argument list (there are technical
	   limitations to using $a and $b like "sort" does).

	   See Moose::Meta::Attribute::Native for the new documentation.

       The "alias" and "excludes" role parameters have been renamed to
       "-alias" and "-excludes". The old names still work, but new code should
       use the new names, and eventually the old ones will be deprecated and
       removed.

Version 0.89
       "use Moose -metaclass => 'Foo'" now does alias resolution, just like
       "-traits" (and the "metaclass" and "traits" options to "has").

       Added two functions "meta_class_alias" and "meta_attribute_alias" to
       Moose::Util, to simplify aliasing metaclasses and metatraits. This is a
       wrapper around the old

	 package Moose::Meta::Class::Custom::Trait::FooTrait;
	 sub register_implementation { 'My::Meta::Trait' }

       way of doing this.

Version 0.84
       When an attribute generates no accessors, we now warn. This is to help
       users who forget the "is" option. If you really do not want any
       accessors, you can use "is => 'bare'". You can maintain back compat
       with older versions of Moose by using something like:

	   ($Moose::VERSION >= 0.84 ? is => 'bare' : ())

       When an accessor overwrites an existing method, we now warn. To work
       around this warning (if you really must have this behavior), you can
       explicitly remove the method before creating it as an accessor:

	   sub foo {}

	   __PACKAGE__->meta->remove_method('foo');

	   has foo => (
	       is => 'ro',
	   );

       When an unknown option is passed to "has", we now warn. You can silence
       the warning by fixing your code. :)

       The "Role" type has been deprecated. On its own, it was useless, since
       it just checked "$object->can('does')". If you were using it as a
       parent type, just call "role_type('Role::Name')" to create an
       appropriate type instead.

Version 0.78
       "use Moose::Exporter;" now imports "strict" and "warnings" into
       packages that use it.

Version 0.77
       "DEMOLISHALL" and "DEMOLISH" now receive an argument indicating whether
       or not we are in global destruction.

Version 0.76
       Type constraints no longer run coercions for a value that already
       matches the constraint.	This may affect some (arguably buggy) edge
       case coercions that rely on side effects in the "via" clause.

Version 0.75
       Moose::Exporter now accepts the "-metaclass" option for easily
       overriding the metaclass (without metaclass). This works for classes
       and roles.

Version 0.74
       Added a "duck_type" sugar function to Moose::Util::TypeConstraints to
       make integration with non-Moose classes easier. It simply checks if
       "$obj->can()" a list of methods.

       A number of methods (mostly inherited from Class::MOP) have been
       renamed with a leading underscore to indicate their internal-ness. The
       old method names will still work for a while, but will warn that the
       method has been renamed. In a few cases, the method will be removed
       entirely in the future. This may affect MooseX authors who were using
       these methods.

Version 0.73
       Calling "subtype" with a name as the only argument now throws an
       exception. If you want an anonymous subtype do:

	   my $subtype = subtype as 'Foo';

       This is related to the changes in version 0.71_01.

       The "is_needed" method in Moose::Meta::Method::Destructor is now only
       usable as a class method. Previously, it worked as a class or object
       method, with a different internal implementation for each version.

       The internals of making a class immutable changed a lot in Class::MOP
       0.78_02, and Moose's internals have changed along with it. The external
       "$metaclass->make_immutable" method still works the same way.

Version 0.72
       A mutable class accepted "Foo->new(undef)" without complaint, while an
       immutable class would blow up with an unhelpful error. Now, in both
       cases we throw a helpful error instead.

       This "feature" was originally added to allow for cases such as this:

	 my $args;

	 if ( something() ) {
	     $args = {...};
	 }

	 return My::Class->new($args);

       But we decided this is a bad idea and a little too magical, because it
       can easily mask real errors.

Version 0.71_01
       Calling "type" or "subtype" without the sugar helpers ("as", "where",
       "message") is now deprecated.

       As a side effect, this meant we ended up using Perl prototypes on "as",
       and code like this will no longer work:

	 use Moose::Util::TypeConstraints;
	 use Declare::Constraints::Simple -All;

	 subtype 'ArrayOfInts'
	     => as 'ArrayRef'
	     => IsArrayRef(IsInt);

       Instead it must be changed to this:

	 subtype(
	     'ArrayOfInts' => {
		 as    => 'ArrayRef',
		 where => IsArrayRef(IsInt)
	     }
	 );

       If you want to maintain backwards compat with older versions of Moose,
       you must explicitly test Moose's "VERSION":

	 if ( Moose->VERSION < 0.71_01 ) {
	     subtype 'ArrayOfInts'
		 => as 'ArrayRef'
		 => IsArrayRef(IsInt);
	 }
	 else {
	     subtype(
		 'ArrayOfInts' => {
		     as    => 'ArrayRef',
		     where => IsArrayRef(IsInt)
		 }
	     );
	 }

Version 0.70
       We no longer pass the meta-attribute object as a final argument to
       triggers. This actually changed for inlined code a while back, but the
       non-inlined version and the docs were still out of date.

       If by some chance you actually used this feature, the workaround is
       simple. You fetch the attribute object from out of the $self that is
       passed as the first argument to trigger, like so:

	 has 'foo' => (
	     is      => 'ro',
	     isa     => 'Any',
	     trigger => sub {
		 my ( $self, $value ) = @_;
		 my $attr = $self->meta->find_attribute_by_name('foo');

		 # ...
	     }
	 );

Version 0.66
       If you created a subtype and passed a parent that Moose didn't know
       about, it simply ignored the parent. Now it automatically creates the
       parent as a class type. This may not be what you want, but is less
       broken than before.

       You could declare a name with subtype such as "Foo!Bar". Moose would
       accept this allowed, but if you used it in a parameterized type such as
       "ArrayRef[Foo!Bar]" it wouldn't work. We now do some vetting on names
       created via the sugar functions, so that they can only contain
       alphanumerics, ":", and ".".

Version 0.65
       Methods created via an attribute can now fulfill a "requires"
       declaration for a role. Honestly we don't know why Stevan didn't make
       this work originally, he was just insane or something.

       Stack traces from inlined code will now report the line and file as
       being in your class, as opposed to in Moose guts.

Version 0.62_02
       When a class does not provide all of a role's required methods, the
       error thrown now mentions all of the missing methods, as opposed to
       just the first missing method.

       Moose will no longer inline a constructor for your class unless it
       inherits its constructor from Moose::Object, and will warn when it
       doesn't inline. If you want to force inlining anyway, pass
       "replace_constructor => 1" to "make_immutable".

       If you want to get rid of the warning, pass "inline_constructor => 0".

Version 0.62
       Removed the (deprecated) "make_immutable" keyword.

       Removing an attribute from a class now also removes delegation
       ("handles") methods installed for that attribute. This is correct
       behavior, but if you were wrongly relying on it you might get bit.

Version 0.58
       Roles now add methods by calling "add_method", not "alias_method". They
       make sure to always provide a method object, which will be cloned
       internally. This means that it is now possible to track the source of a
       method provided by a role, and even follow its history through
       intermediate roles.  This means that methods added by a role now show
       up when looking at a class's method list/map.

       Parameter and Union args are now sorted, this makes Int|Str the same
       constraint as Str|Int. Also, incoming type constraint strings are
       normalized to remove all whitespace differences. This is mostly for
       internals and should not affect outside code.

       Moose::Exporter will no longer remove a subroutine that the exporting
       package re-exports. Moose re-exports the Carp::confess function, among
       others. The reasoning is that we cannot know whether you have also
       explicitly imported those functions for your own use, so we err on the
       safe side and always keep them.

Version 0.56
       "Moose::init_meta" should now be called as a method.

       New modules for extension writers, Moose::Exporter and
       Moose::Util::MetaRole.

Version 0.55_01
       Implemented metaclass traits (and wrote a recipe for it):

	 use Moose -traits => 'Foo'

       This should make writing small Moose extensions a little easier.

Version 0.55
       Fixed "coerce" to accept anon types just like "subtype" can.  So that
       you can do:

	 coerce $some_anon_type => from 'Str' => via { ... };

Version 0.51
       Added "BUILDARGS", a new step in "Moose::Object->new()".

Version 0.49
       Fixed how the "is => (ro|rw)" works with custom defined "reader",
       "writer" and "accessor" options. See the below table for details:

	 is => ro, writer => _foo    # turns into (reader => foo, writer => _foo)
	 is => rw, writer => _foo    # turns into (reader => foo, writer => _foo)
	 is => rw, accessor => _foo  # turns into (accessor => _foo)
	 is => ro, accessor => _foo  # error, accesor is rw

Version 0.45
       The "before/around/after" method modifiers now support regexp matching
       of method names. NOTE: this only works for classes, it is currently not
       supported in roles, but, ... patches welcome.

       The "has" keyword for roles now accepts the same array ref form that
       Moose.pm does for classes.

       A trigger on a read-only attribute is no longer an error, as it's
       useful to trigger off of the constructor.

       Subtypes of parameterizable types now are parameterizable types
       themselves.

Version 0.44
       Fixed issue where "DEMOLISHALL" was eating the value in $@, and so not
       working correctly. It still kind of eats them, but so does vanilla
       perl.

Version 0.41
       Inherited attributes may now be extended without restriction on the
       type ('isa', 'does').

       The entire set of Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint::* classes were
       refactored in this release. If you were relying on their internals you
       should test your code carefully.

Version 0.40
       Documenting the use of '+name' with attributes that come from recently
       composed roles. It makes sense, people are using it, and so why not
       just officially support it.

       The "Moose::Meta::Class->create" method now supports roles.

       It is now possible to make anonymous enum types by passing "enum" an
       array reference instead of the "enum $name => @values".

Version 0.37
       Added the "make_immutable" keyword as a shortcut to calling
       "make_immutable" on the meta object. This eventually got removed!

       Made "init_arg => undef" work in Moose. This means "do not accept a
       constructor parameter for this attribute".

       Type errors now use the provided message. Prior to this release they
       didn't.

Version 0.34
       Moose is now a postmodern object system :)

       The Role system was completely refactored. It is 100% backwards compat,
       but the internals were totally changed. If you relied on the internals
       then you are advised to test carefully.

       Added method exclusion and aliasing for Roles in this release.

       Added the Moose::Util::TypeConstraints::OptimizedConstraints module.

       Passing a list of values to an accessor (which is only expecting one
       value) used to be silently ignored, now it throws an error.

Version 0.26
       Added parameterized types and did a pretty heavy refactoring of the
       type constraint system.

       Better framework extendability and better support for "making your own
       Moose".

Version 0.25 or before
       Honestly, you shouldn't be using versions of Moose that are this old,
       so many bug fixes and speed improvements have been made you would be
       crazy to not upgrade.

       Also, I am tired of going through the Changelog so I am stopping here,
       if anyone would like to continue this please feel free.
