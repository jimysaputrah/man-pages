NAME
       Inline::Struct -- Manipulate C structures directly from Perl.

SYNOPSIS
	 use Inline C =&gt Config =&gt Structs =&gt ['Foo'];

	 my $obj = Inline::Struct::Foo-&gtnew;
	 $obj-&gtnum(10);
	 $obj-&gtstr("Hello");

	 myfunc($obj);

	 __END__
	 __C__

	 struct Foo {
	   int num;
	   char *str;
	 };

	 void myfunc(Foo *f) {
	   printf("myfunc: num=%i, str='%s'\n", f-&gtnum, f-&gtstr);
	 }

       This complete program prints:

	 myfunc: num=10, str='Hello'

DESCRIPTION
       Inline::Struct is not a new language. It's a language extension
       designed to be used by Inline::C. It parses struct definitions and
       creates typemaps and XS code which bind each struct into a Perl class.
       This code is passed to Inline::C, which compiles it in the normal way.

       NOTE: Inline::Struct parses only C-style structs. It doesn't know about
       any C++ extensions to structs like scopes, constructors or methods. If
       you want such functionality you should use Inline::CPP to parse your
       structs.

Using Inline::Struct
       Inline::Struct has a Parse::RecDescent grammar to parse C structs. If a
       struct is recognized, it can be bound to Perl. If the struct's
       definition is not recognized (usually because it has a member with no
       typemap), it will not be bound to Perl, but will be available from
       other functions in C or C++.

       The following example shows how a simple struct might look to a Perl
       programmer.

       Example 1:

	 use Inline C =&gt &lt&lt'END', ENABLE =&gt 'STRUCTS';
	 struct Fraction {
	   long numer;
	   long denom;
	 };
	 END

	 my $o = Inline::Struct::Fraction-&gtnew(4, 3);
	 print $o-&gtnumer, $o-&gtdenom, "\n";
	 $o-&gtnumer(4)-&gtdenom(7);

       After the code above has been compiled, Perl's namespace looks a lot
       like the following:

	 package Inline::Struct::Fraction;
	 sub new { }
	 sub DESTROY { }
	 sub _KEYS { }
	 sub _VALUES { }
	 sub _HASH { }
	 sub numer { }
	 sub denom { }

       Note that these are actually XS subs written in C, not Perl subs. But
       that's what it looks like.

The Struct Interface
       The following sections define the interface of each subroutine. Note:
       this interface is likely to change in future versions of
       Inline::Struct. Please don't rely on Inline::Struct in production code
       quite yet.

       When a struct is bound by Inline::Struct, a new namespace is created
       underneath Inline::Struct. So if you have a struct named 'Foo', the
       package of the Perl class will be 'Inline::Struct::Foo'.

   new
       If no arguments are provided, all fields are zeroed out. If you provide
       values, they should be appropriate for the field type, and in the same
       order as they are defined in the struct.

   DESTROY
       The destructor. Should never be called by the programmer -- this is
       called automatically when the Perl variable holding the struct is
       destroyed. Frees the memory associated with the struct. If the struct
       holds pointers to malloc'd memory, they will not be freed. If you run
       into such a situation, consider using C++ and Inline::CPP instead.

   _KEYS
       A read-only method, this returns a reference to an array containing the
       names of the fields in the struct. The fields are in the order they
       appear in the C source code.

   _VALUES
       A read-only method, this returns a reference to an array containing the
       values of the fields in the struct. The values are returned in the same
       order as the fields.

   _HASH
       A read-only method, this returns a reference to a hash, mapping field
       names to field values.

   Accessors
       For each field in the struct, an accessor sub will be created which
       lets you get or set the value in the struct. If no arguments are
       provided, the sub returns the value of that field. If any arguments are
       provided, the field is set to the first argument, and the modified
       structure is returned. This makes setting multiple fields easy:

	  $o-&gtfield1(something)-&gtfield2(somethingelse);

C and C++ Configuration Options
       Inline::Struct has no configuration options of its own, but it does
       provide a new configuration option for C or C++.

   STRUCTS
       Specifies that structs are to be bound to Perl. There are several
       meanings to this option, so I'll explain with an example:

	  use Inline C =&gt Config =&gt STRUCTS =&gt 'Foo';

       Adds 'Foo' to the list of structs to bind to Perl.

	  use Inline C =&gt Config =&gt STRUCTS =&gt ['Foo', 'Bar'];

       Adds 'Foo' and 'Bar' to the list of structs to bind to Perl.

	  use Inline C =&gt Config =&gt STRUCTS =&gt undef;

       Clears the list of structs to bind to Perl.

	  use Inline C =&gt Config =&gt ENABLE =&gt 'STRUCTS';
       or
	  use Inline C =&gt Config =&gt STRUCTS =&gt 1;

       Enable binding structs to Perl, without specifying any structs to
       search for.  As shown, this would bind all structs to Perl.

	  use Inline C =&gt Config =&gt DISABLE =&gt 'STRUCTS';
       or
	  use Inline C =&gt Config =&gt STRUCTS =&gt 0;

       Disable binding structs to Perl.
