NAME
       DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::Replicated - BETA Replicated database
       support

SYNOPSIS
       The Following example shows how to change an existing $schema to a
       replicated storage type, add some replicated (read-only) databases, and
       perform reporting tasks.

       You should set the 'storage_type attribute to a replicated type.  You
       should also define your arguments, such as which balancer you want and
       any arguments that the Pool object should get.

	 my $schema = Schema::Class->clone;
	 $schema->storage_type( ['::DBI::Replicated', {balancer=>'::Random'}] );
	 $schema->connection(...);

       Next, you need to add in the Replicants.  Basically this is an array of
       arrayrefs, where each arrayref is database connect information.	Think
       of these arguments as what you'd pass to the 'normal' $schema->connect
       method.

	 $schema->storage->connect_replicants(
	   [$dsn1, $user, $pass, \%opts],
	   [$dsn2, $user, $pass, \%opts],
	   [$dsn3, $user, $pass, \%opts],
	 );

       Now, just use the $schema as you normally would.  Automatically all
       reads will be delegated to the replicants, while writes to the master.

	 $schema->resultset('Source')->search({name=>'etc'});

       You can force a given query to use a particular storage using the
       search attribute 'force_pool'.  For example:

	 my $RS = $schema->resultset('Source')->search(undef, {force_pool=>'master'});

       Now $RS will force everything (both reads and writes) to use whatever
       was setup as the master storage.  'master' is hardcoded to always point
       to the Master, but you can also use any Replicant name.	Please see:
       DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::Replicated::Pool and the replicants
       attribute for more.

       Also see transactions and "execute_reliably" for alternative ways to
       force read traffic to the master.  In general, you should wrap your
       statements in a transaction when you are reading and writing to the
       same tables at the same time, since your replicants will often lag a
       bit behind the master.

       See DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::Replicated::Instructions for more help
       and walkthroughs.

DESCRIPTION
       Warning: This class is marked BETA.  This has been running a production
       website using MySQL native replication as its backend and we have some
       decent test coverage but the code hasn't yet been stressed by a variety
       of databases.  Individual DBs may have quirks we are not aware of.
       Please use this in first development and pass along your
       experiences/bug fixes.

       This class implements replicated data store for DBI. Currently you can
       define one master and numerous slave database connections. All write-
       type queries (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE and even LAST_INSERT_ID) are
       routed to master database, all read-type queries (SELECTs) go to the
       slave database.

       Basically, any method request that DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI would
       normally handle gets delegated to one of the two attributes:
       "read_handler" or to "write_handler".  Additionally, some methods need
       to be distributed to all existing storages.  This way our storage class
       is a drop in replacement for DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI.

       Read traffic is spread across the replicants (slaves) occurring to a
       user selected algorithm.  The default algorithm is random weighted.

NOTES
       The consistency between master and replicants is database specific.
       The Pool gives you a method to validate its replicants, removing and
       replacing them when they fail/pass predefined criteria.	Please make
       careful use of the ways to force a query to run against Master when
       needed.

REQUIREMENTS
       Replicated Storage has additional requirements not currently part of
       DBIx::Class. See DBIx::Class::Optional::Dependencies for more details.

ATTRIBUTES
       This class defines the following attributes.

   schema
       The underlying DBIx::Class::Schema object this storage is attaching

   pool_type
       Contains the classname which will instantiate the "pool" object.
       Defaults to: DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::Replicated::Pool.

   pool_args
       Contains a hashref of initialized information to pass to the Balancer
       object.	See DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::Replicated::Pool for available
       arguments.

   balancer_type
       The replication pool requires a balance class to provider the methods
       for choose how to spread the query load across each replicant in the
       pool.

   balancer_args
       Contains a hashref of initialized information to pass to the Balancer
       object.	See DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::Replicated::Balancer for
       available arguments.

   pool
       Is a DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::Replicated::Pool or derived class.
       This is a container class for one or more replicated databases.

   balancer
       Is a DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::Replicated::Balancer or derived class.
       This is a class that takes a pool
       (DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::Replicated::Pool)

   master
       The master defines the canonical state for a pool of connected
       databases.  All the replicants are expected to match this databases
       state.  Thus, in a classic Master / Slaves distributed system, all the
       slaves are expected to replicate the Master's state as quick as
       possible.  This is the only database in the pool of databases that is
       allowed to handle write traffic.

ATTRIBUTES IMPLEMENTING THE DBIx::Storage::DBI INTERFACE
       The following methods are delegated all the methods required for the
       DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI interface.

   read_handler
       Defines an object that implements the read side of
       BIx::Class::Storage::DBI.

   write_handler
       Defines an object that implements the write side of
       BIx::Class::Storage::DBI, as well as methods that don't write or read
       that can be called on only one storage, methods that return a $dbh, and
       any methods that don't make sense to run on a replicant.

   around: connect_info
       Preserves master's "connect_info" options (for merging with
       replicants.)  Also sets any Replicated-related options from
       connect_info, such as "pool_type", "pool_args", "balancer_type" and
       "balancer_args".

METHODS
       This class defines the following methods.

   BUILDARGS
       DBIx::Class::Schema when instantiating its storage passed itself as the
       first argument.	So we need to massage the arguments a bit so that all
       the bits get put into the correct places.

   _build_master
       Lazy builder for the "master" attribute.

   _build_pool
       Lazy builder for the "pool" attribute.

   _build_balancer
       Lazy builder for the "balancer" attribute.  This takes a Pool object so
       that the balancer knows which pool it's balancing.

   _build_write_handler
       Lazy builder for the "write_handler" attribute.	The default is to set
       this to the "master".

   _build_read_handler
       Lazy builder for the "read_handler" attribute.  The default is to set
       this to the "balancer".

   around: connect_replicants
       All calls to connect_replicants needs to have an existing $schema
       tacked onto top of the args, since DBIx::Storage::DBI needs it, and any
       "connect_info" options merged with the master, with replicant opts
       having higher priority.

   all_storages
       Returns an array of of all the connected storage backends.  The first
       element in the returned array is the master, and the remainings are
       each of the replicants.

   execute_reliably ($coderef, ?@args)
       Given a coderef, saves the current state of the "read_handler", forces
       it to use reliable storage (e.g. sets it to the master), executes a
       coderef and then restores the original state.

       Example:

	 my $reliably = sub {
	   my $name = shift @_;
	   $schema->resultset('User')->create({name=>$name});
	   my $user_rs = $schema->resultset('User')->find({name=>$name});
	   return $user_rs;
	 };

	 my $user_rs = $schema->storage->execute_reliably($reliably, 'John');

       Use this when you must be certain of your database state, such as when
       you just inserted something and need to get a resultset including it,
       etc.

   set_reliable_storage
       Sets the current $schema to be 'reliable', that is all queries, both
       read and write are sent to the master

   set_balanced_storage
       Sets the current $schema to be use the </balancer> for all reads, while
       all writes are sent to the master only

   connected
       Check that the master and at least one of the replicants is connected.

   ensure_connected
       Make sure all the storages are connected.

   limit_dialect
       Set the limit_dialect for all existing storages

   quote_char
       Set the quote_char for all existing storages

   name_sep
       Set the name_sep for all existing storages

   set_schema
       Set the schema object for all existing storages

   debug
       set a debug flag across all storages

   debugobj
       set a debug object

   debugfh
       set a debugfh object

   debugcb
       set a debug callback

   disconnect
       disconnect everything

   cursor_class
       set cursor class on all storages, or return master's

   cursor
       set cursor class on all storages, or return master's, alias for
       "cursor_class" above.

   unsafe
       sets the "unsafe" in DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI option on all storages
       or returns master's current setting

   disable_sth_caching
       sets the "disable_sth_caching" in DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI option on
       all storages or returns master's current setting

   lag_behind_master
       returns the highest Replicant "lag_behind_master" in
       DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI setting

   is_replicating
       returns true if all replicants return true for "is_replicating" in
       DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI

   connect_call_datetime_setup
       calls "connect_call_datetime_setup" in DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI for
       all storages

GOTCHAS
       Due to the fact that replicants can lag behind a master, you must take
       care to make sure you use one of the methods to force read queries to a
       master should you need realtime data integrity.	For example, if you
       insert a row, and then immediately re-read it from the database (say,
       by doing $row->discard_changes) or you insert a row and then
       immediately build a query that expects that row to be an item, you
       should force the master to handle reads.  Otherwise, due to the lag,
       there is no certainty your data will be in the expected state.

       For data integrity, all transactions automatically use the master
       storage for all read and write queries.	Using a transaction is the
       preferred and recommended method to force the master to handle all read
       queries.

       Otherwise, you can force a single query to use the master with the
       'force_pool' attribute:

	 my $row = $resultset->search(undef, {force_pool=>'master'})->find($pk);

       This attribute will safely be ignore by non replicated storages, so you
       can use the same code for both types of systems.

       Lastly, you can use the "execute_reliably" method, which works very
       much like a transaction.

       For debugging, you can turn replication on/off with the methods
       "set_reliable_storage" and "set_balanced_storage", however this
       operates at a global level and is not suitable if you have a shared
       Schema object being used by multiple processes, such as on a web
       application server.  You can get around this limitation by using the
       Schema clone method.

	 my $new_schema = $schema->clone;
	 $new_schema->set_reliable_storage;

	 ## $new_schema will use only the Master storage for all reads/writes while
	 ## the $schema object will use replicated storage.
