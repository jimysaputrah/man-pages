NAME
       SPI_connect - connect a procedure to the SPI manager

SYNOPSIS
       int SPI_connect(void)

DESCRIPTION
       SPI_connect opens a connection from a procedure invocation to the SPI
       manager. You must call this function if you want to execute commands
       through SPI. Some utility SPI functions can be called from unconnected
       procedures.

       If your procedure is already connected, SPI_connect will return the
       error code SPI_ERROR_CONNECT. This could happen if a procedure that has
       called SPI_connect directly calls another procedure that calls
       SPI_connect. While recursive calls to the SPI manager are permitted
       when an SQL command called through SPI invokes another function that
       uses SPI, directly nested calls to SPI_connect and SPI_finish are
       forbidden. (But see SPI_push and SPI_pop.)

RETURN VALUE
       SPI_OK_CONNECT
	   on success

       SPI_ERROR_CONNECT
	   on error
