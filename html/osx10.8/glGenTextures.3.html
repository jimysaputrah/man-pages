NAME
       glGenTextures - generate texture names


C SPECIFICATION
       void glGenTextures( GLsizei n,
			   GLuint *textures )


PARAMETERS
       n	 Specifies the number of texture names to be generated.

       textures  Specifies  an	array in which the generated texture names are
		 stored.

DESCRIPTION
       glGenTextures returns n texture names in textures.  There is no guaran-
       tee  that  the  names form a contiguous set of integers; however, it is
       guaranteed that none of the  returned  names  was  in  use  immediately
       before the call to glGenTextures.

       The  generated  textures have no dimensionality; they assume the dimen-
       sionality of the texture target to which  they  are  first  bound  (see
       glBindTexture).

       Texture	names  returned by a call to glGenTextures are not returned by
       subsequent calls, unless they are first deleted with  glDeleteTextures.

NOTES
       glGenTextures is available only if the GL version is 1.1 or greater.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if n is negative.

       GL_INVALID_OPERATION  is generated if glGenTextures is executed between
       the execution of glBegin and the corresponding execution of glEnd.

ASSOCIATED GETS
       glIsTexture
