NAME
       XS::Typemap - module to test the XS typemaps distributed with perl

SYNOPSIS
	 use XS::Typemap;

	 $output = T_IV( $input );
	 $output = T_PV( $input );
	 @output = T_ARRAY( @input );

DESCRIPTION
       This module is used to test that the XS typemaps distributed with perl
       are working as advertised. A function is available for each typemap
       definition (eventually). In general each function takes a variable,
       processes it through the OUTPUT typemap and then returns it using the
       INPUT typemap.

       A test script can then compare the input and output to make sure they
       are the expected values. When only an input or output function is
       provided the function will be named after the typemap entry and have
       either '_IN' or '_OUT' appended.

       All the functions are exported. There is no reason not to do this since
       the entire purpose is for testing Perl. Namespace pollution will be
       limited to the test script.

NOTES
       This module is for testing only and should not normally be installed.
