DEVNAME(3)		 BSD Library Functions Manual		    DEVNAME(3)

NAME
     devname, devname_r -- get device name

LIBRARY
     Standard C Library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/stat.h>
     #include <stdlib.h>

     char *
     devname(dev_t dev, mode_t type);

     char *
     devname_r(dev_t dev, mode_t type, char *buf, int len);

DESCRIPTION
     The devname() function returns a pointer to the name of the block or
     character device in ``/dev'' with a device number of dev, and a file type
     matching the one encoded in type which must be one of S_IFBLK or S_IFCHR.
     If no device matches the specified values, or no information is avail-
     able, NULL is returned.

     The devname() function uses a static buffer, which will be overwritten on
     subsequent calls.	The devname_r() functions takes a buffer and length as
     arguments to avoid this problem.

     The traditional display for applications when no device is found is the
     string ``??''.

     stat(2), dev_mkdb(8)

HISTORY
     The devname() function call appeared in 4.4BSD.
