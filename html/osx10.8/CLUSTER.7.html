CLUSTER(7)		PostgreSQL 9.1.4 Documentation		    CLUSTER(7)



NAME
       CLUSTER - cluster a table according to an index

SYNOPSIS
       CLUSTER [VERBOSE] table_name [ USING index_name ]
       CLUSTER [VERBOSE]

DESCRIPTION
       CLUSTER instructs PostgreSQL to cluster the table specified by
       table_name based on the index specified by index_name. The index must
       already have been defined on table_name.

       When a table is clustered, it is physically reordered based on the
       index information. Clustering is a one-time operation: when the table
       is subsequently updated, the changes are not clustered. That is, no
       attempt is made to store new or updated rows according to their index
       order. (If one wishes, one can periodically recluster by issuing the
       command again. Also, setting the table's FILLFACTOR storage parameter
       to less than 100% can aid in preserving cluster ordering during
       updates, since updated rows are kept on the same page if enough space
       is available there.)

       When a table is clustered, PostgreSQL remembers which index it was
       clustered by. The form CLUSTER table_name reclusters the table using
       the same index as before. You can also use the CLUSTER or SET WITHOUT
       CLUSTER forms of ALTER TABLE (ALTER_TABLE(7)) to set the index to be
       used for future cluster operations, or to clear any previous setting.


       CLUSTER without any parameter reclusters all the previously-clustered
       tables in the current database that the calling user owns, or all such
       tables if called by a superuser. This form of CLUSTER cannot be
       executed inside a transaction block.

       When a table is being clustered, an ACCESS EXCLUSIVE lock is acquired
       on it. This prevents any other database operations (both reads and
       writes) from operating on the table until the CLUSTER is finished.

PARAMETERS
       table_name
	   The name (possibly schema-qualified) of a table.

       index_name
	   The name of an index.

       VERBOSE
	   Prints a progress report as each table is clustered.

NOTES
       In cases where you are accessing single rows randomly within a table,
       the actual order of the data in the table is unimportant. However, if
       you tend to access some data more than others, and there is an index
       that groups them together, you will benefit from using CLUSTER. If you
       are requesting a range of indexed values from a table, or a single
       indexed value that has multiple rows that match, CLUSTER will help
       because once the index identifies the table page for the first row that
       matches, all other rows that match are probably already on the same
       table page, and so you save disk accesses and speed up the query.


       CLUSTER can re-sort the table using either an index scan on the
       specified index, or (if the index is a b-tree) a sequential scan
       followed by sorting. It will attempt to choose the method that will be
       faster, based on planner cost parameters and available statistical
       information.

       When an index scan is used, a temporary copy of the table is created
       that contains the table data in the index order. Temporary copies of
       each index on the table are created as well. Therefore, you need free
       space on disk at least equal to the sum of the table size and the index
       sizes.

       When a sequential scan and sort is used, a temporary sort file is also
       created, so that the peak temporary space requirement is as much as
       double the table size, plus the index sizes. This method is often
       faster than the index scan method, but if the disk space requirement is
       intolerable, you can disable this choice by temporarily setting
       enable_sort to off.

       It is advisable to set maintenance_work_mem to a reasonably large value
       (but not more than the amount of RAM you can dedicate to the CLUSTER
       operation) before clustering.

       Because the planner records statistics about the ordering of tables, it
       is advisable to run ANALYZE(7) on the newly clustered table. Otherwise,
       the planner might make poor choices of query plans.

       Because CLUSTER remembers which indexes are clustered, one can cluster
       the tables one wants clustered manually the first time, then set up a
       periodic maintenance script that executes CLUSTER without any
       parameters, so that the desired tables are periodically reclustered.

EXAMPLES
       Cluster the table employees on the basis of its index employees_ind:

	   CLUSTER employees USING employees_ind;

       Cluster the employees table using the same index that was used before:

	   CLUSTER employees;

       Cluster all tables in the database that have previously been clustered:

	   CLUSTER;

COMPATIBILITY
       There is no CLUSTER statement in the SQL standard.

       The syntax

	   CLUSTER index_name ON table_name


       is also supported for compatibility with pre-8.3 PostgreSQL versions.
