DBLINK_SEND_QUERY(3)	PostgreSQL 9.1.4 Documentation	  DBLINK_SEND_QUERY(3)



NAME
       dblink_send_query - sends an async query to a remote database

SYNOPSIS
       dblink_send_query(text connname, text sql) returns int

DESCRIPTION
       dblink_send_query sends a query to be executed asynchronously, that is,
       without immediately waiting for the result. There must not be an async
       query already in progress on the connection.

       After successfully dispatching an async query, completion status can be
       checked with dblink_is_busy, and the results are ultimately collected
       with dblink_get_result. It is also possible to attempt to cancel an
       active async query using dblink_cancel_query.

ARGUMENTS
       conname
	   Name of the connection to use.

       sql
	   The SQL statement that you wish to execute in the remote database,
	   for example select * from pg_class.

RETURN VALUE
       Returns 1 if the query was successfully dispatched, 0 otherwise.

EXAMPLES
	   SELECT dblink_send_query('dtest1', 'SELECT * FROM foo WHERE f1 &lt 3');
