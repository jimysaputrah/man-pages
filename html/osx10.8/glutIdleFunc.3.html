NAME
       glutIdleFunc - sets the global idle callback.

SYNTAX
       #include <GLUT/glut.h>

       void glutIdleFunc(void (*func)(void));

ARGUMENTS
       func	 The new idle callback function.

DESCRIPTION
       glutIdleFunc sets the global idle callback to be func so a GLUT program
       can perform background processing tasks or  continuous  animation  when
       window system events are not being received. If enabled, the idle call-
       back is continuously called when events are  not  being	received.  The
       callback routine has no parameters. The current window and current menu
       will not be changed before the idle callback.  Programs	with  multiple
       windows	and/or	menus  should explicitly set the current window and/or
       current menu and not rely on its current setting.

       The amount of computation and rendering done in an idle callback should
       be  minimized to avoid affecting the program's interactive response. In
       general, not more than a single frame of rendering should be done in an
       idle callback.

       Passing	NULL to glutIdleFunc disables the generation of the idle call-
       back.

EXAMPLE
       A typical idle callback to animate a window might look like:

	 void
	 idle(void)
	 {
	   time += 0.05;
	   glutSetWindow(window);
	   glutPostRedisplay();
	 }

       Notice how the idle callback does not do any actual  drawing;  it  only
       advances  the  time  scene  state global variable.  That is left to the
       window's display callback which will be triggered by the call to  glut-
       PostRedisplay.

       If  you use the idle callback for animation, you should be sure to stop
       rendering when the window is not visible.  This is easy to set up  with
       a visibility callback.  For example:

	 void
	 visible(int vis)
	 {
	   if (vis == GLUT_VISIBLE)
	     glutIdleFunc(idle);
	   else
	     glutIdleFunc(NULL);
	 }

       If you do use the idle callback for animation, one thing you should not
       do is setup the idle callback before calling glutMainLoop.  It is  much
       better to use the visibility callback to install idle callback when the
       window first becomes visible on the screen.
