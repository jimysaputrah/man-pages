NAME
       git-http-push - Push objects over HTTP/DAV to another repository

SYNOPSIS
       git http-push [--all] [--dry-run] [--force] [--verbose] &lturl&gt &ltref&gt [&ltref&gt...]


DESCRIPTION
       Sends missing objects to remote repository, and updates the remote
       branch.

       NOTE: This command is temporarily disabled if your libcurl is older
       than 7.16, as the combination has been reported not to work and
       sometimes corrupts repository.

OPTIONS
       --all
	   Do not assume that the remote repository is complete in its current
	   state, and verify all objects in the entire local ref's history
	   exist in the remote repository.

       --force
	   Usually, the command refuses to update a remote ref that is not an
	   ancestor of the local ref used to overwrite it. This flag disables
	   the check. What this means is that the remote repository can lose
	   commits; use it with care.

       --dry-run
	   Do everything except actually send the updates.

       --verbose
	   Report the list of objects being walked locally and the list of
	   objects successfully sent to the remote repository.

       -d, -D
	   Remove &ltref&gt from remote repository. The specified branch cannot be
	   the remote HEAD. If -d is specified the following other conditions
	   must also be met:

	   o   Remote HEAD must resolve to an object that exists locally

	   o   Specified branch resolves to an object that exists locally

	   o   Specified branch is an ancestor of the remote HEAD

       &ltref&gt...
	   The remote refs to update.

SPECIFYING THE REFS
       A &ltref&gt specification can be either a single pattern, or a pair of such
       patterns separated by a colon ":" (this means that a ref name cannot
       have a colon in it). A single pattern &ltname&gt is just a shorthand for
       &ltname&gt:&ltname&gt.

       Each pattern pair consists of the source side (before the colon) and
       the destination side (after the colon). The ref to be pushed is
       determined by finding a match that matches the source side, and where
       it is pushed is determined by using the destination side.

       o   It is an error if &ltsrc&gt does not match exactly one of the local
	   refs.

       o   If &ltdst&gt does not match any remote ref, either

	   o   it has to start with "refs/"; &ltdst&gt is used as the destination
	       literally in this case.

	   o   &ltsrc&gt == &ltdst&gt and the ref that matched the &ltsrc&gt must not
	       exist in the set of remote refs; the ref matched &ltsrc&gt locally
	       is used as the name of the destination.

       Without --force, the &ltsrc&gt ref is stored at the remote only if &ltdst&gt
       does not exist, or &ltdst&gt is a proper subset (i.e. an ancestor) of
       &ltsrc&gt. This check, known as "fast-forward check", is performed in order
       to avoid accidentally overwriting the remote ref and lose other
       peoples' commits from there.

       With --force, the fast-forward check is disabled for all refs.

       Optionally, a &ltref&gt parameter can be prefixed with a plus + sign to
       disable the fast-forward check only on that ref.
