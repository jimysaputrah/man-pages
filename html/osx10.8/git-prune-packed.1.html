NAME
       git-prune-packed - Remove extra objects that are already in pack files

SYNOPSIS
       git prune-packed [-n|--dry-run] [-q|--quiet]


DESCRIPTION
       This program searches the $GIT_OBJECT_DIR for all objects that
       currently exist in a pack file as well as the independent object
       directories.

       All such extra objects are removed.

       A pack is a collection of objects, individually compressed, with delta
       compression applied, stored in a single file, with an associated index
       file.

       Packs are used to reduce the load on mirror systems, backup engines,
       disk storage, etc.

OPTIONS
       -n, --dry-run
	   Don't actually remove any objects, only show those that would have
	   been removed.

       -q, --quiet
	   Squelch the progress indicator.
