DESCRIPTION
       Moose is an extension of the Perl 5 object system.

       The main goal of Moose is to make Perl 5 Object Oriented programming
       easier, more consistent and less tedious. With Moose you can to think
       more about what you want to do and less about the mechanics of OOP.

       Additionally, Moose is built on top of Class::MOP, which is a metaclass
       system for Perl 5. This means that Moose not only makes building normal
       Perl 5 objects better, but it provides the power of metaclass
       programming as well.

   New to Moose?
       If you're new to Moose, the best place to start is the Moose::Manual
       docs, followed by the Moose::Cookbook. The intro will show you what
       Moose is, and how it makes Perl 5 OO better.

       The cookbook recipes on Moose basics will get you up to speed with many
       of Moose's features quickly. Once you have an idea of what Moose can
       do, you can use the API documentation to get more detail on features
       which interest you.

   Moose Extensions
       The "MooseX::" namespace is the official place to find Moose
       extensions.  These extensions can be found on the CPAN.	The easiest
       way to find them is to search for them
       (&lthttp://search.cpan.org/search?query=MooseX::&gt), or to examine
       Task::Moose which aims to keep an up-to-date, easily installable list
       of Moose extensions.

TRANSLATIONS
       Much of the Moose documentation has been translated into other
       languages.

       Japanese
	   Japanese docs can be found at
	   &lthttp://perldoc.perlassociation.org/pod/Moose-Doc-JA/index.html&gt.

BUILDING CLASSES WITH MOOSE
       Moose makes every attempt to provide as much convenience as possible
       during class construction/definition, but still stay out of your way if
       you want it to. Here are a few items to note when building classes with
       Moose.

       Unless specified with "extends", any class which uses Moose will
       inherit from Moose::Object.

       Moose will also manage all attributes (including inherited ones) that
       are defined with "has". And (assuming you call "new", which is
       inherited from Moose::Object) this includes properly initializing all
       instance slots, setting defaults where appropriate, and performing any
       type constraint checking or coercion.

PROVIDED METHODS
       Moose provides a number of methods to all your classes, mostly through
       the inheritance of Moose::Object. There is however, one exception.

       meta
	   This is a method which provides access to the current class's
	   metaclass.

EXPORTED FUNCTIONS
       Moose will export a number of functions into the class's namespace
       which may then be used to set up the class. These functions all work
       directly on the current class.

       extends (@superclasses)
	   This function will set the superclass(es) for the current class.

	   This approach is recommended instead of "use base", because "use
	   base" actually "push"es onto the class's @ISA, whereas "extends"
	   will replace it. This is important to ensure that classes which do
	   not have superclasses still properly inherit from Moose::Object.

       with (@roles)
	   This will apply a given set of @roles to the local class.

       has $name|@$names =&gt %options
	   This will install an attribute of a given $name into the current
	   class. If the first parameter is an array reference, it will create
	   an attribute for every $name in the list. The %options are the same
	   as those provided by Class::MOP::Attribute, in addition to the list
	   below which are provided by Moose (Moose::Meta::Attribute to be
	   more specific):

	   is =&gt 'rw'|'ro'
	       The is option accepts either rw (for read/write) or ro (for
	       read only). These will create either a read/write accessor or a
	       read-only accessor respectively, using the same name as the
	       $name of the attribute.

	       If you need more control over how your accessors are named, you
	       can use the reader, writer and accessor options inherited from
	       Class::MOP::Attribute, however if you use those, you won't need
	       the is option.

	   isa =&gt $type_name
	       The isa option uses Moose's type constraint facilities to set
	       up runtime type checking for this attribute. Moose will perform
	       the checks during class construction, and within any accessors.
	       The $type_name argument must be a string. The string may be
	       either a class name or a type defined using Moose's type
	       definition features. (Refer to Moose::Util::TypeConstraints for
	       information on how to define a new type, and how to retrieve
	       type meta-data).

	   coerce =&gt (1|0)
	       This will attempt to use coercion with the supplied type
	       constraint to change the value passed into any accessors or
	       constructors. You must have supplied a type constraint in order
	       for this to work. See Moose::Cookbook::Basics::Recipe5 for an
	       example.

	   does =&gt $role_name
	       This will accept the name of a role which the value stored in
	       this attribute is expected to have consumed.

	   required =&gt (1|0)
	       This marks the attribute as being required. This means a value
	       must be supplied during class construction, or the attribute
	       must be lazy and have either a default or a builder. Note that
	       c&ltrequired&gt does not say anything about the attribute's value,
	       which can be "undef".

	   weak_ref =&gt (1|0)
	       This will tell the class to store the value of this attribute
	       as a weakened reference. If an attribute is a weakened
	       reference, it cannot also be coerced.

	   lazy =&gt (1|0)
	       This will tell the class to not create this slot until
	       absolutely necessary.  If an attribute is marked as lazy it
	       must have a default supplied.

	   auto_deref =&gt (1|0)
	       This tells the accessor to automatically dereference the value
	       of this attribute when called in list context.  The accessor
	       will still return a reference when called in scalar context.
	       If this behavior isn't desirable, "elements" in
	       Moose::Meta::Attribute::Native::Trait::Array or "elements" in
	       Moose::Meta::Attribute::Native::Trait::Hash may be a better
	       choice.	The auto_deref option is only legal if your isa option
	       is either "ArrayRef" or "HashRef".

	   trigger =&gt $code
	       The trigger option is a CODE reference which will be called
	       after the value of the attribute is set. The CODE ref is passed
	       the instance itself, the updated value, and the original value
	       if the attribute was already set.

	       You can have a trigger on a read-only attribute.

	       NOTE: Triggers will only fire when you assign to the attribute,
	       either in the constructor, or using the writer. Default and
	       built values will not cause the trigger to be fired.

	   handles =&gt ARRAY | HASH | REGEXP | ROLE | ROLETYPE | DUCKTYPE |
	   CODE
	       The handles option provides Moose classes with automated
	       delegation features.  This is a pretty complex and powerful
	       option. It accepts many different option formats, each with its
	       own benefits and drawbacks.

	       NOTE: The class being delegated to does not need to be a Moose
	       based class, which is why this feature is especially useful
	       when wrapping non-Moose classes.

	       All handles option formats share the following traits:

	       You cannot override a locally defined method with a delegated
	       method; an exception will be thrown if you try. That is to say,
	       if you define "foo" in your class, you cannot override it with
	       a delegated "foo". This is almost never something you would
	       want to do, and if it is, you should do it by hand and not use
	       Moose.

	       You cannot override any of the methods found in Moose::Object,
	       or the "BUILD" and "DEMOLISH" methods. These will not throw an
	       exception, but will silently move on to the next method in the
	       list. My reasoning for this is that you would almost never want
	       to do this, since it usually breaks your class. As with
	       overriding locally defined methods, if you do want to do this,
	       you should do it manually, not with Moose.

	       You do not need to have a reader (or accessor) for the
	       attribute in order to delegate to it. Moose will create a means
	       of accessing the value for you, however this will be several
	       times less efficient then if you had given the attribute a
	       reader (or accessor) to use.

	       Below is the documentation for each option format:

	       "ARRAY"
		   This is the most common usage for handles. You basically
		   pass a list of method names to be delegated, and Moose will
		   install a delegation method for each one.

	       "HASH"
		   This is the second most common usage for handles. Instead
		   of a list of method names, you pass a HASH ref where each
		   key is the method name you want installed locally, and its
		   value is the name of the original method in the class being
		   delegated to.

		   This can be very useful for recursive classes like trees.
		   Here is a quick example (soon to be expanded into a
		   Moose::Cookbook recipe):

		     package Tree;
		     use Moose;

		     has 'node' =&gt (is =&gt 'rw', isa =&gt 'Any');

		     has 'children' =&gt (
			 is	 =&gt 'ro',
			 isa	 =&gt 'ArrayRef',
			 default =&gt sub { [] }
		     );

		     has 'parent' =&gt (
			 is	     =&gt 'rw',
			 isa	     =&gt 'Tree',
			 weak_ref =&gt 1,
			 handles     =&gt {
			     parent_node =&gt 'node',
			     siblings	 =&gt 'children',
			 }
		     );

		   In this example, the Tree package gets "parent_node" and
		   "siblings" methods, which delegate to the "node" and
		   "children" methods (respectively) of the Tree instance
		   stored in the "parent" slot.

		   You may also use an array reference to curry arguments to
		   the original method.

		     has 'thing' =&gt (
			 ...
			 handles =&gt { set_foo =&gt [ set =&gt 'foo' ] },
		     );

		     # $self-&gtset_foo(...) calls $self-&gtthing-&gtset('foo', ...)

		   The first element of the array reference is the original
		   method name, and the rest is a list of curried arguments.

	       "REGEXP"
		   The regexp option works very similar to the ARRAY option,
		   except that it builds the list of methods for you. It
		   starts by collecting all possible methods of the class
		   being delegated to, then filters that list using the regexp
		   supplied here.

		   NOTE: An isa option is required when using the regexp
		   option format. This is so that we can determine (at compile
		   time) the method list from the class.  Without an isa this
		   is just not possible.

	       "ROLE" or "ROLETYPE"
		   With the role option, you specify the name of a role or a
		   role type whose "interface" then becomes the list of
		   methods to handle. The "interface" can be defined as; the
		   methods of the role and any required methods of the role.
		   It should be noted that this does not include any method
		   modifiers or generated attribute methods (which is
		   consistent with role composition).

	       "DUCKTYPE"
		   With the duck type option, you pass a duck type object
		   whose "interface" then becomes the list of methods to
		   handle. The "interface" can be defined as; the list of
		   methods passed to "duck_type" to create a duck type object.
		   For more information on "duck_type" please check
		   Moose::Util::TypeConstraints.

	       "CODE"
		   This is the option to use when you really want to do
		   something funky. You should only use it if you really know
		   what you are doing, as it involves manual metaclass
		   twiddling.

		   This takes a code reference, which should expect two
		   arguments. The first is the attribute meta-object this
		   handles is attached to. The second is the metaclass of the
		   class being delegated to. It expects you to return a hash
		   (not a HASH ref) of the methods you want mapped.

	   metaclass =&gt $metaclass_name
	       This tells the class to use a custom attribute metaclass for
	       this particular attribute. Custom attribute metaclasses are
	       useful for extending the capabilities of the has keyword: they
	       are the simplest way to extend the MOP, but they are still a
	       fairly advanced topic and too much to cover here, see
	       Moose::Cookbook::Meta::Recipe1 for more information.

	       See "Metaclass and Trait Name Resolution" for details on how a
	       metaclass name is resolved to a class name.

	   traits =&gt [ @role_names ]
	       This tells Moose to take the list of @role_names and apply them
	       to the attribute meta-object. This is very similar to the
	       metaclass option, but allows you to use more than one extension
	       at a time.

	       See "Metaclass and Trait Name Resolution" for details on how a
	       trait name is resolved to a role name.

	       Also see Moose::Cookbook::Meta::Recipe3 for a metaclass trait
	       example.

	   builder =&gt Str
	       The value of this key is the name of the method that will be
	       called to obtain the value used to initialize the attribute.
	       See the builder option docs in Class::MOP::Attribute
		and/or Moose::Cookbook::Basics::Recipe8 for more information.

	   default =&gt SCALAR | CODE
	       The value of this key is the default value which will
	       initialize the attribute.

	       NOTE: If the value is a simple scalar (string or number), then
	       it can be just passed as is.  However, if you wish to
	       initialize it with a HASH or ARRAY ref, then you need to wrap
	       that inside a CODE reference.  See the default option docs in
	       Class::MOP::Attribute for more information.

	   clearer =&gt Str
	       Creates a method allowing you to clear the value, see the
	       clearer option docs in Class::MOP::Attribute for more
	       information.

	   predicate =&gt Str
	       Creates a method to perform a basic test to see if a value has
	       been set in the attribute, see the predicate option docs in
	       Class::MOP::Attribute for more information.

	   lazy_build =&gt (0|1)
	       Automatically define lazy =&gt 1 as well as builder =&gt
	       "_build_$attr", clearer =&gt "clear_$attr', predicate =&gt
	       'has_$attr' unless they are already defined.

	   initializer =&gt Str
	       This may be a method name (referring to a method on the class
	       with this attribute) or a CODE ref.  The initializer is used to
	       set the attribute value on an instance when the attribute is
	       set during instance initialization (but not when the value is
	       being assigned to). See the initializer option docs in
	       Class::MOP::Attribute for more information.

	   documentation =&gt $string
	       An arbitrary string that can be retrieved later by calling
	       "$attr-&gtdocumentation".

       has +$name =&gt %options
	   This is variation on the normal attribute creator "has" which
	   allows you to clone and extend an attribute from a superclass or
	   from a role. Here is an example of the superclass usage:

	     package Foo;
	     use Moose;

	     has 'message' =&gt (
		 is	 =&gt 'rw',
		 isa	 =&gt 'Str',
		 default =&gt 'Hello, I am a Foo'
	     );

	     package My::Foo;
	     use Moose;

	     extends 'Foo';

	     has '+message' =&gt (default =&gt 'Hello I am My::Foo');

	   What is happening here is that My::Foo is cloning the "message"
	   attribute from its parent class Foo, retaining the "is =&gt 'rw'" and
	   "isa =&gt 'Str'" characteristics, but changing the value in
	   "default".

	   Here is another example, but within the context of a role:

	     package Foo::Role;
	     use Moose::Role;

	     has 'message' =&gt (
		 is	 =&gt 'rw',
		 isa	 =&gt 'Str',
		 default =&gt 'Hello, I am a Foo'
	     );

	     package My::Foo;
	     use Moose;

	     with 'Foo::Role';

	     has '+message' =&gt (default =&gt 'Hello I am My::Foo');

	   In this case, we are basically taking the attribute which the role
	   supplied and altering it within the bounds of this feature.

	   Note that you can only extend an attribute from either a superclass
	   or a role, you cannot extend an attribute in a role that composes
	   over an attribute from another role.

	   Aside from where the attributes come from (one from superclass, the
	   other from a role), this feature works exactly the same. This
	   feature is restricted somewhat, so as to try and force at least
	   some sanity into it. You are only allowed to change the following
	   attributes:

	   default
	       Change the default value of an attribute.

	   coerce
	       Change whether the attribute attempts to coerce a value passed
	       to it.

	   required
	       Change if the attribute is required to have a value.

	   documentation
	       Change the documentation string associated with the attribute.

	   lazy
	       Change if the attribute lazily initializes the slot.

	   isa You are allowed to change the type without restriction.

	       It is recommended that you use this freedom with caution. We
	       used to only allow for extension only if the type was a subtype
	       of the parent's type, but we felt that was too restrictive and
	       is better left as a policy decision.

	   handles
	       You are allowed to add a new "handles" definition, but you are
	       not allowed to change one.

	   builder
	       You are allowed to add a new "builder" definition, but you are
	       not allowed to change one.

	   metaclass
	       You are allowed to add a new "metaclass" definition, but you
	       are not allowed to change one.

	   traits
	       You are allowed to add additional traits to the "traits"
	       definition.  These traits will be composed into the attribute,
	       but preexisting traits are not overridden, or removed.

       before $name|@names|\@names|qr/.../ =&gt sub { ... }
       after $name|@names|\@names|qr/.../ =&gt sub { ... }
       around $name|@names|\@names|qr/.../ =&gt sub { ... }
	   These three items are syntactic sugar for the before, after, and
	   around method modifier features that Class::MOP provides. More
	   information on these may be found in Moose::Manual::MethodModifiers
	   and the Class::MOP::Class documentation.

       super
	   The keyword "super" is a no-op when called outside of an "override"
	   method. In the context of an "override" method, it will call the
	   next most appropriate superclass method with the same arguments as
	   the original method.

       override ($name, &sub)
	   An "override" method is a way of explicitly saying "I am overriding
	   this method from my superclass". You can call "super" within this
	   method, and it will work as expected. The same thing can be
	   accomplished with a normal method call and the "SUPER::" pseudo-
	   package; it is really your choice.

       inner
	   The keyword "inner", much like "super", is a no-op outside of the
	   context of an "augment" method. You can think of "inner" as being
	   the inverse of "super"; the details of how "inner" and "augment"
	   work is best described in the Moose::Cookbook::Basics::Recipe6.

       augment ($name, &sub)
	   An "augment" method, is a way of explicitly saying "I am augmenting
	   this method from my superclass". Once again, the details of how
	   "inner" and "augment" work is best described in the
	   Moose::Cookbook::Basics::Recipe6.

       confess
	   This is the "Carp::confess" function, and exported here because I
	   use it all the time.

       blessed
	   This is the "Scalar::Util::blessed" function, it is exported here
	   because I use it all the time. It is highly recommended that this
	   is used instead of "ref" anywhere you need to test for an object's
	   class name.

METACLASS
       When you use Moose, you can specify which metaclass to use:

	   use Moose -metaclass =&gt 'My::Meta::Class';

       You can also specify traits which will be applied to your metaclass:

	   use Moose -traits =&gt 'My::Trait';

       This is very similar to the attribute traits feature. When you do this,
       your class's "meta" object will have the specified traits applied to
       it. See "Metaclass and Trait Name Resolution" for more details.

   Metaclass and Trait Name Resolution
       By default, when given a trait name, Moose simply tries to load a class
       of the same name. If such a class does not exist, it then looks for for
       a class matching Moose::Meta::$type::Custom::Trait::$trait_name. The
       $type variable here will be one of Attribute or Class, depending on
       what the trait is being applied to.

       If a class with this long name exists, Moose checks to see if it has
       the method "register_implementation". This method is expected to return
       the real class name of the trait. If there is no
       "register_implementation" method, it will fall back to using
       Moose::Meta::$type::Custom::Trait::$trait as the trait name.

       The lookup method for metaclasses is the same, except that it looks for
       a class matching Moose::Meta::$type::Custom::$metaclass_name.

       If all this is confusing, take a look at
       Moose::Cookbook::Meta::Recipe3, which demonstrates how to create an
       attribute trait.

UNIMPORTING FUNCTIONS
   unimport
       Moose offers a way to remove the keywords it exports, through the
       "unimport" method. You simply have to say "no Moose" at the bottom of
       your code for this to work. Here is an example:

	   package Person;
	   use Moose;

	   has 'first_name' =&gt (is =&gt 'rw', isa =&gt 'Str');
	   has 'last_name'  =&gt (is =&gt 'rw', isa =&gt 'Str');

	   sub full_name {
	       my $self = shift;
	       $self-&gtfirst_name . ' ' . $self-&gtlast_name
	   }

EXTENDING AND EMBEDDING MOOSE
       To learn more about extending Moose, we recommend checking out the
       "Extending" recipes in the Moose::Cookbook, starting with
       Moose::Cookbook::Extending::Recipe1, which provides an overview of all
       the different ways you might extend Moose.

   Moose-&gtinit_meta(for_class =&gt $class, base_class =&gt $baseclass, metaclass
       =&gt $metaclass)
       The "init_meta" method sets up the metaclass object for the class
       specified by "for_class". This method injects a a "meta" accessor into
       the class so you can get at this object. It also sets the class's
       superclass to "base_class", with Moose::Object as the default.

       "init_meta" returns the metaclass object for $class.

       You can specify an alternate metaclass with the "metaclass" option.

       For more detail on this topic, see Moose::Cookbook::Extending::Recipe2.

       This method used to be documented as a function which accepted
       positional parameters. This calling style will still work for backwards
       compatibility, but is deprecated.

   import
       Moose's "import" method supports the Sub::Exporter form of "{into =&gt
       $pkg}" and "{into_level =&gt 1}".

       NOTE: Doing this is more or less deprecated. Use Moose::Exporter
       instead, which lets you stack multiple "Moose.pm"-alike modules sanely.
       It handles getting the exported functions into the right place for you.

   throw_error
       An alias for "confess", used by internally by Moose.

METACLASS COMPATIBILITY AND MOOSE
       Metaclass compatibility is a thorny subject. You should start by
       reading the "About Metaclass compatibility" section in the "Class::MOP"
       docs.

       Moose will attempt to resolve a few cases of metaclass incompatibility
       when you set the superclasses for a class, unlike "Class::MOP", which
       simply dies if the metaclasses are incompatible.

       In actuality, Moose fixes incompatibility for all of a class's
       metaclasses, not just the class metaclass. That includes the instance
       metaclass, attribute metaclass, as well as its constructor class and
       destructor class. However, for simplicity this discussion will just
       refer to "metaclass", meaning the class metaclass, most of the time.

       Moose has two algorithms for fixing metaclass incompatibility.

       The first algorithm is very simple. If all the metaclass for the parent
       is a subclass of the child's metaclass, then we simply replace the
       child's metaclass with the parent's.

       The second algorithm is more complicated. It tries to determine if the
       metaclasses only "differ by roles". This means that the parent and
       child's metaclass share a common ancestor in their respective
       hierarchies, and that the subclasses under the common ancestor are only
       different because of role applications. This case is actually fairly
       common when you mix and match various "MooseX::*" modules, many of
       which apply roles to the metaclass.

       If the parent and child do differ by roles, Moose replaces the
       metaclass in the child with a newly created metaclass. This metaclass
       is a subclass of the parent's metaclass, does all of the roles that the
       child's metaclass did before being replaced. Effectively, this means
       the new metaclass does all of the roles done by both the parent's and
       child's original metaclasses.

       Ultimately, this is all transparent to you except in the case of an
       unresolvable conflict.

   The MooseX:: namespace
       Generally if you're writing an extension for Moose itself you'll want
       to put your extension in the "MooseX::" namespace. This namespace is
       specifically for extensions that make Moose better or different in some
       fundamental way. It is traditionally not for a package that just
       happens to use Moose. This namespace follows from the examples of the
       "LWPx::" and "DBIx::" namespaces that perform the same function for
       "LWP" and "DBI" respectively.

CAVEATS
       o   It should be noted that "super" and "inner" cannot be used in the
	   same method. However, they may be combined within the same class
	   hierarchy; see t/014_override_augment_inner_super.t for an example.

	   The reason for this is that "super" is only valid within a method
	   with the "override" modifier, and "inner" will never be valid
	   within an "override" method. In fact, "augment" will skip over any
	   "override" methods when searching for its appropriate "inner".

	   This might seem like a restriction, but I am of the opinion that
	   keeping these two features separate (yet interoperable) actually
	   makes them easy to use, since their behavior is then easier to
	   predict. Time will tell whether I am right or not (UPDATE: so far
	   so good).

GETTING HELP
       We offer both a mailing list and a very active IRC channel.

       The mailing list is moose@perl.org. You must be subscribed to send a
       message. To subscribe, send an empty message to
       moose-subscribe@perl.org

       You can also visit us at "#moose" on &ltirc://irc.perl.org/#moose&gt This
       channel is quite active, and questions at all levels (on Moose-related
       topics ;) are welcome.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
       I blame Sam Vilain for introducing me to the insanity that is meta-
       models.
       I blame Audrey Tang for then encouraging my meta-model habit in #perl6.
       Without Yuval "nothingmuch" Kogman this module would not be possible,
       and it certainly wouldn't have this name ;P
       The basis of the TypeContraints module was Rob Kinyon's idea
       originally, I just ran with it.
       Thanks to mst & chansen and the whole #moose posse for all the early
       ideas/feature-requests/encouragement/bug-finding.
       Thanks to David "Theory" Wheeler for meta-discussions and spelling
       fixes.

   Books
       The Art of the MetaObject Protocol
	   I mention this in the Class::MOP docs too, this book was critical
	   in the development of both modules and is highly recommended.

   Papers
       &lthttp://www.cs.utah.edu/plt/publications/oopsla04-gff.pdf&gt
	   This paper (suggested by lbr on #moose) was what lead to the
	   implementation of the "super"/"override" and "inner"/"augment"
	   features. If you really want to understand them, I suggest you read
	   this.

BUGS
       All complex software has bugs lurking in it, and this module is no
       exception.

       Please report any bugs to "bug-moose@rt.cpan.org", or through the web
       interface at &lthttp://rt.cpan.org&gt.

       You can also discuss feature requests or possible bugs on the Moose
       mailing list (moose@perl.org) or on IRC at &ltirc://irc.perl.org/#moose&gt.

FEATURE REQUESTS
       We are very strict about what features we add to the Moose core,
       especially the user-visible features. Instead we have made sure that
       the underlying meta-system of Moose is as extensible as possible so
       that you can add your own features easily.

       That said, occasionally there is a feature needed in the meta-system to
       support your planned extension, in which case you should either email
       the mailing list (moose@perl.org) or join us on IRC at
       &ltirc://irc.perl.org/#moose&gt to discuss. The Moose::Manual::Contributing
       has more detail about how and when you can contribute.

AUTHOR
       Moose is an open project, there are at this point dozens of people who
       have contributed, and can contribute. If you have added anything to the
       Moose project you have a commit bit on this file and can add your name
       to the list.

   CABAL
       However there are only a few people with the rights to release a new
       version of Moose. The Moose Cabal are the people to go to with
       questions regarding the wider purview of Moose, and help out
       maintaining not just the code but the community as well.
