       typedef unsigned long mmask_t;

       typedef struct
       {
	   short id;	     /* ID to distinguish multiple devices */

DESCRIPTION
       These functions provide an interface to mouse events from  ncurses(3X).
       Mouse  events  are  represented	by  KEY_MOUSE pseudo-key values in the
       wgetch input stream.

       To make mouse events visible, use the mousemask	function.   This  will
       set  the  mouse events to be reported.  By default, no mouse events are
       reported.  The function will return a mask to  indicate	which  of  the
       specified  mouse events can be reported; on complete failure it returns
       0.  If oldmask is non-NULL, this function fills the indicated  location
       with the previous value of the given window's mouse event mask.

       As  a  side  effect,  setting  a  zero mousemask may turn off the mouse
       pointer; setting a nonzero mask may turn it on.	Whether  this  happens
       is device-dependent.

       Here are the mouse event type masks which may be defined:

       Once  a class of mouse events have been made visible in a window, call-
       ing the wgetch function on that window may return KEY_MOUSE as an indi-
       cator  that  a mouse event has been queued.  To read the event data and
       pop the event off the queue, call getmouse.  This function will	return
       OK if a mouse event is actually visible in the given window, ERR other-
       wise.  When getmouse returns OK, the data deposited as y and x  in  the
       event  structure coordinates will be screen-relative character-cell co-
       ordinates.  The returned state mask will have exactly one  bit  set  to
       indicate the event type.

       The  ungetmouse	function  behaves analogously to ungetch.  It pushes a
       KEY_MOUSE event onto the input queue, and associates  with  that  event
       the given state data and screen-relative character-cell coordinates.

       The  wenclose  function	tests  whether a given pair of screen-relative
       character-cell coordinates is enclosed by  a  given  window,  returning
       TRUE  if  it is and FALSE otherwise.  It is useful for determining what
       subset of the screen windows enclose the location of a mouse event.

       The wmouse_trafo function transforms a given pair of  coordinates  from
       stdscr-relative coordinates to coordinates relative to the given window
       or vice versa.  Please remember, that stdscr-relative  coordinates  are
       not  always  identical to window-relative coordinates due to the mecha-
       nism to reserve lines on top or bottom of the screen for other purposes
       (see the ripoffline() and slk_init calls, for example).	If the parame-
       ter to_screen is TRUE, the pointers pY, pX must reference  the  coordi-
       nates  of a location inside the window win.  They are converted to win-
       dow-relative coordinates and returned through  the  pointers.   If  the
       conversion  was	successful,  the function returns TRUE.  If one of the
       parameters was NULL or the location is not inside the window, FALSE  is
       returned.   If  to_screen  is FALSE, the pointers pY, pX must reference
       window-relative coordinates.  They are converted to stdscr-relative co-
       ordinates  if  the  window  win	encloses this point.  In this case the
       function returns TRUE.  If one of the parameters is NULL or  the  point
       is  not	inside the window, FALSE is returned.  Please notice, that the
       referenced coordinates are only replaced by the	converted  coordinates
       if the transformation was successful.

       The mouse_trafo function performs the same translation as wmouse_trafo,
       using stdscr for win.

       The mouseinterval function sets the maximum time  (in  thousands  of  a
       second) that can elapse between press and release events for them to be
       recognized as a click.  Use mouseinterval(0) to disable	click  resolu-
       tion.  This function returns the previous interval value.  Use mousein-
       terval(-1) to obtain the interval without altering it.  The default  is
       one sixth of a second.

       Note  that  mouse  events will be ignored when input is in cooked mode,
       and will cause an error beep when cooked mode is being simulated  in  a
       window  by a function such as getstr that expects a linefeed for input-
       loop termination.

RETURN VALUE
       getmouse and ungetmouse return the integer ERR upon failure or OK  upon
       successful completion.

	      getmouse
		   returns  an	error.	If no mouse driver was initialized, or
		   if the mask parameter is zero,

	      ungetmouse
		   returns an error if the FIFO is full.

       mousemask returns the mask of reportable events.

       mouseinterval returns the previous interval value, unless the  terminal
       was  not  initialized.	In  that case, it returns the maximum interval
       value (166).

       wenclose and wmouse_trafo are boolean functions returning TRUE or FALSE
       depending on their test result.

PORTABILITY
       These  calls  were  designed for ncurses(3X), and are not found in SVr4
       curses, 4.4BSD curses, or any other previous version of curses.

       The feature macro NCURSES_MOUSE_VERSION is provided so the preprocessor
       can  be used to test whether these features are present.  If the inter-
       face is changed, the value of NCURSES_MOUSE_VERSION will be  increment-
       ed.   These values for NCURSES_MOUSE_VERSION may be specified when con-
       figuring ncurses:

	      1  has definitions for reserved events.  The mask uses 28  bits.

	      2  adds  definitions  for  button 5, removes the definitions for
		 reserved events.  The mask uses 29 bits.

       The order of the MEVENT structure members is not guaranteed.  Addition-
       al fields may be added to the structure in the future.

       Under  ncurses(3X),  these  calls  are implemented using either xterm's
       built-in mouse-tracking API or platform-specific drivers including
	      Alessandro Rubini's gpm server.
	      FreeBSD sysmouse
	      OS/2 EMX
       If you are using an unsupported configuration, mouse events will not be
       visible	to  ncurses(3X) (and the mousemask function will always return
       0).

       If the terminfo entry contains a XM string, this is used in  the  xterm
       mouse  driver  to control the way the terminal is initialized for mouse
       operation.  The default, if XM is not  found,  corresponds  to  private
       mode 1000 of xterm:
	      \E[?1000%?%p1%{1}%=%th%el%;
       The  z  member in the event structure is not presently used.  It is in-
       tended for use with touch screens (which may be pressure-sensitive)  or
       with 3D-mice/trackballs/power gloves.

BUGS
       Mouse  events  under  xterm  will  not in fact be ignored during cooked
       mode, if they have been enabled by mousemask.  Instead, the xterm mouse
       report sequence will appear in the string read.

       Mouse  events  under  xterm  will not be detected correctly in a window
       with its keypad bit off, since they are interpreted  as	a  variety  of
       function  key.	Your  terminfo	description  should  have kmous set to
       "\E[M" (the beginning of the response from  xterm  for  mouse  clicks).
       Other  values  for  kmous are permitted, but under the same assumption,
       i.e., it is the beginning of the response.

       Because there are no standard terminal responses that  would  serve  to
       identify  terminals which support the xterm mouse protocol, ncurses as-
       sumes that if your $TERM  environment  variable	contains  "xterm",  or
       kmous  is  defined  in  the terminal description, then the terminal may
       send mouse events.
