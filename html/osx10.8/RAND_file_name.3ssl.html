RAND_load_file(3)		    OpenSSL		     RAND_load_file(3)



NAME
       RAND_load_file, RAND_write_file, RAND_file_name - PRNG seed file

SYNOPSIS
	#include &ltopenssl/rand.h&gt

	const char *RAND_file_name(char *buf, size_t num);

	int RAND_load_file(const char *filename, long max_bytes);

	int RAND_write_file(const char *filename);

DESCRIPTION
       RAND_file_name() generates a default path for the random seed file. buf
       points to a buffer of size num in which to store the filename. The seed
       file is $RANDFILE if that environment variable is set, $HOME/.rnd
       otherwise. If $HOME is not set either, or num is too small for the path
       name, an error occurs.

       RAND_load_file() reads a number of bytes from file filename and adds
       them to the PRNG. If max_bytes is non-negative, up to to max_bytes are
       read; starting with OpenSSL 0.9.5, if max_bytes is -1, the complete
       file is read.

       RAND_write_file() writes a number of random bytes (currently 1024) to
       file filename which can be used to initialize the PRNG by calling
       RAND_load_file() in a later session.

RETURN VALUES
       RAND_load_file() returns the number of bytes read.

       RAND_write_file() returns the number of bytes written, and -1 if the
       bytes written were generated without appropriate seed.

       RAND_file_name() returns a pointer to buf on success, and NULL on
       error.

SEE ALSO
       rand(3), RAND_add(3), RAND_cleanup(3)

HISTORY
       RAND_load_file(), RAND_write_file() and RAND_file_name() are available
       in all versions of SSLeay and OpenSSL.
