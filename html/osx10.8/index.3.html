INDEX(3)		 BSD Library Functions Manual		      INDEX(3)

NAME
     index, rindex -- locate character in string

LIBRARY
     Standard C Library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
     #include &ltstrings.h&gt

     char *
     index(const char *s, int c);

     char *
     rindex(const char *s, int c);

DESCRIPTION
     The index() function locates the first occurrence of c (converted to a
     char) in the string pointed to by s.  The terminating null character is
     considered to be part of the string; therefore, if c is `\0', the func-
     tions locate the terminating `\0'.

     The rindex() function is identical to index(), except that it locates the
     last occurrence of c.

RETURN VALUES
     The functions index() and rindex() return a pointer to the located char-
     acter, or NULL if the character does not appear in the string.

SEE ALSO
     memchr(3), strchr(3), strcspn(3), strpbrk(3), strrchr(3), strsep(3),
     strspn(3), strstr(3), strtok(3)

HISTORY
     The index() and rindex() functions appeared in Version 6 AT&T UNIX.
     Their prototypes existed previously in &ltstring.h&gt before they were moved
     to &ltstrings.h&gt for IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 (``POSIX.1'') compliance.
