DESCRIPTION
       This bundle includes all the modules used by the Perl Database
       Interface (DBI) module, created by Tim Bunce.

       A Bundle is a module that simply defines a collection of other modules.
       It is used by the CPAN module to automate the fetching, building and
       installing of modules from the CPAN ftp archive sites.

       This bundle does not deal with the various database drivers (e.g.
       DBD::Informix, DBD::Oracle etc), most of which require software from
       sources other than CPAN. You'll need to fetch and build those drivers
       yourself.

AUTHORS
       Jonathan Leffler, Jochen Wiedmann and Tim Bunce.
