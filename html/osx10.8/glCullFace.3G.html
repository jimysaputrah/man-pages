NAME
       glCullFace - specify whether front- or back-facing facets can be culled

C SPECIFICATION
       void glCullFace(GLenum mode);

PARAMETERS
       mode
	   Specifies whether front- or back-facing facets are candidates for
	   culling. Symbolic constants GL_FRONT, GL_BACK, and
	   GL_FRONT_AND_BACK are accepted. The initial value is GL_BACK.

DESCRIPTION
       glCullFace specifies whether front- or back-facing facets are culled
       (as specified by mode) when facet culling is enabled. Facet culling is
       initially disabled. To enable and disable facet culling, call the
       glEnable() and glDisable() commands with the argument GL_CULL_FACE.
       Facets include triangles, quadrilaterals, polygons, and rectangles.


       glFrontFace() specifies which of the clockwise and counterclockwise
       facets are front-facing and back-facing. See glFrontFace().

NOTES
       If mode is GL_FRONT_AND_BACK, no facets are drawn, but other primitives
       such as points and lines are drawn.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if mode is not an accepted value.

ASSOCIATED GETS
       glIsEnabled() with argument GL_CULL_FACE


       glGet() with argument GL_CULL_FACE_MODE

SEE ALSO
