CREATE SCHEMA(7)	PostgreSQL 9.1.4 Documentation	      CREATE SCHEMA(7)



NAME
       CREATE_SCHEMA - define a new schema

SYNOPSIS
       CREATE SCHEMA schema_name [ AUTHORIZATION user_name ] [ schema_element [ ... ] ]
       CREATE SCHEMA AUTHORIZATION user_name [ schema_element [ ... ] ]

DESCRIPTION
       CREATE SCHEMA enters a new schema into the current database. The schema
       name must be distinct from the name of any existing schema in the
       current database.

       A schema is essentially a namespace: it contains named objects (tables,
       data types, functions, and operators) whose names can duplicate those
       of other objects existing in other schemas. Named objects are accessed
       either by "qualifying" their names with the schema name as a prefix, or
       by setting a search path that includes the desired schema(s). A CREATE
       command specifying an unqualified object name creates the object in the
       current schema (the one at the front of the search path, which can be
       determined with the function current_schema).

       Optionally, CREATE SCHEMA can include subcommands to create objects
       within the new schema. The subcommands are treated essentially the same
       as separate commands issued after creating the schema, except that if
       the AUTHORIZATION clause is used, all the created objects will be owned
       by that user.

PARAMETERS
       schema_name
	   The name of a schema to be created. If this is omitted, the user
	   name is used as the schema name. The name cannot begin with pg_, as
	   such names are reserved for system schemas.

       user_name
	   The name of the user who will own the schema. If omitted, defaults
	   to the user executing the command. Only superusers can create
	   schemas owned by users other than themselves.

       schema_element
	   An SQL statement defining an object to be created within the
	   schema. Currently, only CREATE TABLE, CREATE VIEW, CREATE INDEX,
	   CREATE SEQUENCE, CREATE TRIGGER and GRANT are accepted as clauses
	   within CREATE SCHEMA. Other kinds of objects may be created in
	   separate commands after the schema is created.

NOTES
       To create a schema, the invoking user must have the CREATE privilege
       for the current database. (Of course, superusers bypass this check.)

EXAMPLES
       Create a schema:

	   CREATE SCHEMA myschema;

       Create a schema for user joe; the schema will also be named joe:

	   CREATE SCHEMA AUTHORIZATION joe;

       Create a schema and create a table and view within it:

	   CREATE SCHEMA hollywood
	       CREATE TABLE films (title text, release date, awards text[])
	       CREATE VIEW winners AS
		   SELECT title, release FROM films WHERE awards IS NOT NULL;

       Notice that the individual subcommands do not end with semicolons.

       The following is an equivalent way of accomplishing the same result:

	   CREATE SCHEMA hollywood;
	   CREATE TABLE hollywood.films (title text, release date, awards text[]);
	   CREATE VIEW hollywood.winners AS
	       SELECT title, release FROM hollywood.films WHERE awards IS NOT NULL;

COMPATIBILITY
       The SQL standard allows a DEFAULT CHARACTER SET clause in CREATE
       SCHEMA, as well as more subcommand types than are presently accepted by
       PostgreSQL.

       The SQL standard specifies that the subcommands in CREATE SCHEMA can
       appear in any order. The present PostgreSQL implementation does not
       handle all cases of forward references in subcommands; it might
       sometimes be necessary to reorder the subcommands in order to avoid
       forward references.

       According to the SQL standard, the owner of a schema always owns all
       objects within it.  PostgreSQL allows schemas to contain objects owned
       by users other than the schema owner. This can happen only if the
       schema owner grants the CREATE privilege on his schema to someone else.
