DROP COLLATION(7)	PostgreSQL 9.1.4 Documentation	     DROP COLLATION(7)



NAME
       DROP_COLLATION - remove a collation

SYNOPSIS
       DROP COLLATION [ IF EXISTS ] name [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ]

DESCRIPTION
       DROP COLLATION removes a previously defined collation. To be able to
       drop a collation, you must own the collation.

PARAMETERS
       IF EXISTS
	   Do not throw an error if the collation does not exist. A notice is
	   issued in this case.

       name
	   The name of the collation. The collation name can be
	   schema-qualified.

       CASCADE
	   Automatically drop objects that depend on the collation.

       RESTRICT
	   Refuse to drop the collation if any objects depend on it. This is
	   the default.

EXAMPLES
       To drop the collation named german:

	   DROP COLLATION german;

COMPATIBILITY
       The DROP COLLATION command conforms to the SQL standard, apart from the
       IF EXISTS option, which is a PostgreSQL extension.
