NAME
       TAP::Parser::ResultFactory - Factory for creating TAP::Parser output
       objects

SYNOPSIS
	 use TAP::Parser::ResultFactory;
	 my $token   = {...};
	 my $factory = TAP::Parser::ResultFactory-&gtnew;
	 my $result  = $factory-&gtmake_result( $token );

VERSION
       Version 3.17

   DESCRIPTION
       This is a simple factory class which returns a TAP::Parser::Result
       subclass representing the current bit of test data from TAP (usually a
       single line).  It is used primarily by TAP::Parser::Grammar.  Unless
       you're subclassing, you probably won't need to use this module
       directly.

   METHODS
   Class Methods
       "new"

       Creates a new factory class.  Note: You currently don't need to
       instantiate a factory in order to use it.

       "make_result"

       Returns an instance the appropriate class for the test token passed in.

	 my $result = TAP::Parser::ResultFactory-&gtmake_result($token);

       Can also be called as an instance method.

       "class_for"

       Takes one argument: $type.  Returns the class for this $type, or
       "croak"s with an error.

       "register_type"

       Takes two arguments: $type, $class

       This lets you override an existing type with your own custom type, or
       register a completely new type, eg:

	 # create a custom result type:
	 package MyResult;
	 use strict;
	 use vars qw(@ISA);
	 @ISA = 'TAP::Parser::Result';

	 # register with the factory:
	 TAP::Parser::ResultFactory-&gtregister_type( 'my_type' =&gt __PACKAGE__ );

	 # use it:
	 my $r = TAP::Parser::ResultFactory-&gt( { type =&gt 'my_type' } );

       Your custom type should then be picked up automatically by the
       TAP::Parser.

SUBCLASSING
       Please see "SUBCLASSING" in TAP::Parser for a subclassing overview.

       There are a few things to bear in mind when creating your own
       "ResultFactory":

       1.  The factory itself is never instantiated (this may change in the
	   future).  This means that "_initialize" is never called.

       2.  "TAP::Parser::Result-&gtnew" is never called, $tokens are reblessed.
	   This will change in a future version!

       3.  TAP::Parser::Result subclasses will register themselves with
	   TAP::Parser::ResultFactory directly:

	     package MyFooResult;
	     TAP::Parser::ResultFactory-&gtregister_type( foo =&gt __PACKAGE__ );

	   Of course, it's up to you to decide whether or not to ignore them.

   Example
	 package MyResultFactory;

	 use strict;
	 use vars '@ISA';

	 use MyResult;
	 use TAP::Parser::ResultFactory;

	 @ISA = qw( TAP::Parser::ResultFactory );

	 # force all results to be 'MyResult'
	 sub class_for {
	   return 'MyResult';
	 }

	 1;
