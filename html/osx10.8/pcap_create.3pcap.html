NAME
       pcap_create - create a live capture handle

SYNOPSIS
       #include &ltpcap/pcap.h&gt

       char errbuf[PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE];

       pcap_t *pcap_create(const char *source, char *errbuf);

DESCRIPTION
       pcap_create()  is  used	to  create  a packet capture handle to look at
       packets on the network.	source is a string that specifies the  network
       device  to  open;  on Linux systems with 2.2 or later kernels, a source
       argument of "any" or NULL can be  used  to  capture  packets  from  all
       interfaces.

       The returned handle must be activated with pcap_activate() before pack-
       ets can be captured with it; options for the capture, such as promiscu-
       ous mode, can be set on the handle before activating it.

RETURN VALUE
       pcap_create()  returns  a  pcap_t * on success and NULL on failure.  If
       NULL is returned, errbuf is filled in with an  appropriate  error  mes-
       sage.   errbuf  is assumed to be able to hold at least PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE
       chars.
