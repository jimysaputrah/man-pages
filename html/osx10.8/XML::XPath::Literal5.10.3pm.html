XPath::Literal(3)     User Contributed Perl Documentation    XPath::Literal(3)



NAME
       XML::XPath::Literal - Simple string values.

DESCRIPTION
       In XPath terms a Literal is what we know as a string.

API
   new($string)
       Create a new Literal object with the value in $string. Note that &quot;
       and &apos; will be converted to " and ' respectively. That is not part
       of the XPath specification, but I consider it useful. Note though that
       you have to go to extraordinary lengths in an XML template file (be it
       XSLT or whatever) to make use of this:

	       &ltxsl:value-of select="&quot;I'm feeling &amp;quot;sad&amp;quot;&quot;"/&gt

       Which produces a Literal of:

	       I'm feeling "sad"

   value()
       Also overloaded as stringification, simply returns the literal string
       value.

   cmp($literal)
       Returns the equivalent of perl's cmp operator against the given
       $literal.
