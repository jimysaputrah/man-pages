ASN1_OBJECT_new(3)		    OpenSSL		    ASN1_OBJECT_new(3)



NAME
       ASN1_OBJECT_new, ASN1_OBJECT_free, - object allocation functions

SYNOPSIS
	#include &ltopenssl/asn1.h&gt

	ASN1_OBJECT *ASN1_OBJECT_new(void);
	void ASN1_OBJECT_free(ASN1_OBJECT *a);

DESCRIPTION
       The ASN1_OBJECT allocation routines, allocate and free an ASN1_OBJECT
       structure, which represents an ASN1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER.

       ASN1_OBJECT_new() allocates and initializes a ASN1_OBJECT structure.

       ASN1_OBJECT_free() frees up the ASN1_OBJECT structure a.

NOTES
       Although ASN1_OBJECT_new() allocates a new ASN1_OBJECT structure it is
       almost never used in applications. The ASN1 object utility functions
       such as OBJ_nid2obj() are used instead.

RETURN VALUES
       If the allocation fails, ASN1_OBJECT_new() returns NULL and sets an
       error code that can be obtained by ERR_get_error(3).  Otherwise it
       returns a pointer to the newly allocated structure.

       ASN1_OBJECT_free() returns no value.

SEE ALSO
       ERR_get_error(3), d2i_ASN1_OBJECT(3)

HISTORY
       ASN1_OBJECT_new() and ASN1_OBJECT_free() are available in all versions
       of SSLeay and OpenSSL.
