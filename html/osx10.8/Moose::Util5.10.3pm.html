NAME
       Moose::Util - Utilities for working with Moose classes

SYNOPSIS
	 use Moose::Util qw/find_meta does_role search_class_by_role/;

	 my $meta = find_meta($object) || die "No metaclass found";

	 if (does_role($object, $role)) {
	   print "The object can do $role!\n";
	 }

	 my $class = search_class_by_role($object, 'FooRole');
	 print "Nearest class with 'FooRole' is $class\n";

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides a set of utility functions. Many of these
       functions are intended for use in Moose itself or MooseX modules, but
       some of them may be useful for use in your own code.

EXPORTED FUNCTIONS
       find_meta($class_or_obj)
	   This method takes a class name or object and attempts to find a
	   metaclass for the class, if one exists. It will not create one if
	   it does not yet exist.

       does_role($class_or_obj, $role_or_obj)
	   Returns true if $class_or_obj does the given $role_or_obj. The role
	   can be provided as a name or a Moose::Meta::Role object.

	   The class must already have a metaclass for this to work. If it
	   doesn't, this function simply returns false.

       search_class_by_role($class_or_obj, $role_or_obj)
	   Returns the first class in the class's precedence list that does
	   $role_or_obj, if any. The role can be either a name or a
	   Moose::Meta::Role object.

	   The class must already have a metaclass for this to work.

       apply_all_roles($applicant, @roles)
	   This function applies one or more roles to the given $applicant The
	   applicant can be a role name, class name, or object.

	   The $applicant must already have a metaclass object.

	   The list of @roles should a list of names or Moose::Meta::Role
	   objects, each of which can be followed by an optional hash
	   reference of options ("-excludes" and "-alias").

       ensure_all_roles($applicant, @roles)
	   This function is similar to "apply_all_roles", but only applies
	   roles that $applicant does not already consume.

       get_all_attribute_values($meta, $instance)
	   Returns a hash reference containing all of the $instance's
	   attributes. The keys are attribute names.

       get_all_init_args($meta, $instance)
	   Returns a hash reference containing all of the "init_arg" values
	   for the instance's attributes. The values are the associated
	   attribute values. If an attribute does not have a defined
	   "init_arg", it is skipped.

	   This could be useful in cloning an object.

       resolve_metaclass_alias($category, $name, %options)
       resolve_metatrait_alias($category, $name, %options)
	   Resolves a short name to a full class name. Short names are often
	   used when specifying the "metaclass" or "traits" option for an
	   attribute:

	       has foo =&gt (
		   metaclass =&gt "Bar",
	       );

	   The name resolution mechanism is covered in "Metaclass and Trait
	   Name Resolution" in Moose.

       english_list(@items)
	   Given a list of scalars, turns them into a proper list in English
	   ("one and two", "one, two, three, and four"). This is used to help
	   us make nicer error messages.

       meta_class_alias($to[, $from])
       meta_attribute_alias($to[, $from])
	   Create an alias from the class $from (or the current package, if
	   $from is unspecified), so that "Metaclass and Trait Name
	   Resolution" in Moose works properly.

TODO
       Here is a list of possible functions to write

       discovering original method from modified method
       search for origin class of a method or attribute
