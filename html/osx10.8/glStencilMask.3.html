GLSTENCILMASK(3G)					     GLSTENCILMASK(3G)



NAME
       glStencilMask  -  control the writing of individual bits in the stencil
       planes


C SPECIFICATION
       void glStencilMask( GLuint mask )


PARAMETERS
       mask  Specifies a bit mask to enable and disable writing of  individual
	     bits in the stencil planes.  Initially, the mask is all 1's.

DESCRIPTION
       glStencilMask  controls	the  writing of individual bits in the stencil
       planes.	The least significant n bits of mask, where n is the number of
       bits  in  the stencil buffer, specify a mask.  Where a 1 appears in the
       mask, it's possible to write to the corresponding bit  in  the  stencil
       buffer.	 Where	a 0 appears, the corresponding bit is write-protected.
       Initially, all bits are enabled for writing.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if glStencilMask is executed  between
       the execution of glBegin and the corresponding execution of glEnd.

ASSOCIATED GETS
       glGet with argument GL_STENCIL_WRITEMASK
       glGet with argument GL_STENCIL_BITS
