DESCRIPTION
       Please consult the manual of Regexp::Common for a general description
       of the works of this interface.

       Do not use this module directly, but load it via Regexp::Common.

       This modules gives you regular expressions for comments in various
       languages.

   THE LANGUAGES
       Below, the comments of each of the languages are described.  The
       patterns are available as $RE{comment}{LANG}, foreach language LANG.
       Some languages have variants; it's described at the individual
       languages how to get the patterns for the variants.  Unless mentioned
       otherwise, "{-keep}" sets $1, $2, $3 and $4 to the entire comment, the
       opening marker, the content of the comment, and the closing marker (for
       many languages, the latter is a newline) respectively.

       ABC Comments in ABC start with a backslash ("\"), and last till the end
	   of the line.  See <http://homepages.cwi.nl/%7Esteven/abc/>.

       Ada Comments in Ada start with "--", and last till the end of the line.

       Advisor
	   Advisor is a language used by the HP product glance. Comments for
	   this language start with either "#" or "//", and last till the end
	   of the line.

       Advsys
	   Comments for the Advsys language start with ";" and last till the
	   end of the line. See also <http://www.wurb.com/if/devsys/12>.

       Alan
	   Alan comments start with "--", and last till the end of the line.
	   See also
	   <http://w1.132.telia.com/~u13207378/alan/manual/alanTOC.html>.

       Algol 60

       Algol 68
	   In Algol 68, comments are either delimited by "#", or by one of the
	   keywords "co" or "comment". The keywords should not be part of
	   another word. See
	   http://westein.arb-phys.uni-dortmund.de/~wb/a68s.txt
	   <http://westein.arb-phys.uni-dortmund.de/~wb/a68s.txt>.  With

	   "*/".

       BASIC
	   There are various forms of BASIC around. Currently, we only support
	   the variant supported by mvEnterprise, whose pattern is available
	   as $RE{comment}{BASIC}{mvEnterprise}. Comments in this language
	   start with a "!", a "*" or the keyword "REM", and end till the end
	   of the line. See
	   <http://www.rainingdata.com/products/beta/docs/mve/50/ReferenceManual/Basic.pdf>.

       Beatnik
	   The esotoric language Beatnik only uses words consisting of
	   letters.  Words are scored according to the rules of Scrabble.
	   Words scoring less than 5 points, or 18 points or more are
	   considered comments (although the compiler might mock at you if you
	   score less than 5 points).  Regardless whether "{-keep}", $1 will
	   be set, and set to the entire comment. This pattern requires perl
	   5.8.0 or newer.

	   <ftp://ftp.lcs.mit.edu:/pub/pclu/CLU-syntax.ps> and
	   <http://www.pmg.lcs.mit.edu/CLU.html>.

       COBOL
	   Traditionally, comments in COBOL are indicated by an asteriks in
	   the seventh column. This is what the pattern matches. Modern
	   compiler may more lenient though. See
	   <http://www.csis.ul.ie/cobol/Course/COBOLIntro.htm>, and
	   <http://www.csis.ul.ie/cobol/default.htm>. Due to a bug in the
	   regexp engine of perl 5.6.x, this regexp is only available in
	   version 5.8.0 and up.

       Funge-98
	   The esotoric language Funge-98 uses comments that start and end

       Haskell
	   There are two types of comments in Haskell. They either start with
	   at least two dashes, or are nested comments, delimited with "{-"
	   and "-}".  Under "{-keep}", only $1 will be set, returning the
	   entire comment.  This pattern requires perl 5.6.0 or newer.

       HTML
	   In HTML, comments only appear inside a comment declaration.	A
	   comment declaration starts with a "<!", and ends with a ">". Inside
	   this declaration, we have zero or more comments.  Comments starts
	   with "--" and end with "--", and are optionally followed by
	   whitespace. The pattern $RE{comment}{HTML} recognizes those comment
	   declarations (and hence more than a comment).  Note that this is
	   not the same as something that starts with "<!--" and ends with
	   "-->", because the following will be matched completely:

	       <!--  First  Comment   --
		 --> Second Comment <!--
		 --  Third  Comment   -->

	   Do not be fooled by what your favourite browser thinks is an HTML
	   comment.

	   If "{-keep}" is used, the following are returned:

	   $1  captures the entire comment declaration.

	   $2  captures the MDO (markup declaration open), "<!".

	   $3  captures the content between the MDO and the MDC.

	   $4  captures the (last) comment, without the surrounding dashes.

	   $5  captures the MDC (markup declaration close), ">".

       Hugo
	   There are two types of comments in Hugo. They either start with "!"
	   (which cannot be followed by a "\"), or are nested comments,
	   delimited with "!\" and "\!".  Under "{-keep}", only $1 will be
	   set, returning the entire comment.  This pattern requires perl
	   5.6.0 or newer.

       Icon
	   Icon has comments that start with "#" and end at the next new line.
	   See
	   <http://www.toolsofcomputing.com/IconHandbook/IconHandbook.pdf>,
	   <http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/index.htm>, and
	   <http://burks.bton.ac.uk/burks/language/icon/index.htm>.

	   Comments in INTERCAL are single line comments. They start with one
	   of the keywords "NOT" or "N'T", and can optionally be preceeded by
	   the keywords "DO" and "PLEASE". If both keywords are used, "PLEASE"
	   preceeds "DO". Keywords are separated by whitespace.

       J   The language J uses comments that start with "NB.", and that last
	   till the end of the line. See
	   <http://www.jsoftware.com/books/help/primer/contents.htm>, and
	   <http://www.jsoftware.com/>.

       Java
	   The Java language has two forms of comments. Comments that start
	   with "//" and last till the end of the line, and comments that
	   start with "/*", and end with "*/". If "{-keep}" is used, only $1
	   will be set, and set to the entire comment.

       JavaDoc
	   The Javadoc documentation syntax is demarked with a subset of
	   ordinary Java comments to separate it from code.  Comments start
	   with "/**" end with "*/".  If "{-keep}" is used, only $1 will be
	   set, and set to the entire comment. See
	   http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/index-137868.html#format
	   <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/index-137868.html#format>.

	   end of the line. See also <http://www.lua.org/manual/manual.html>.

       M, MUMPS
	   In "M" (aka "MUMPS"), comments start with a semi-colon, and last
	   till the end of a line. The language specification requires the
	   semi-colon to be preceeded by one or more linestart characters.
	   Those characters default to a space, but that's configurable. This
	   requirement, of preceeding the comment with linestart characters is
	   not tested for. See
	   <ftp://ftp.intersys.com/pub/openm/ism/ism64docs.zip>,
	   <http://mtechnology.intersys.com/mproducts/openm/index.html>, and
	   <http://mcenter.com/mtrc/index.html>.

       m4  By default, the preprocessor language m4 uses single line comments,
	   that start with a "#" and continue to the end of the line,
	   including the newline. The pattern "$RE {comment} {m4}" matches
	   such comments.  In m4, it is possible to change the starting token
	   though.  See
	   <http://wolfram.schneider.org/bsd/7thEdManVol2/m4/m4.pdf>,

	   <http://www.oberon.ethz.ch/oreport.html>.

       Pascal
	   There are many implementations of Pascal. This modules provides
	   pattern for comments of several implementations.

	   $RE{comment}{Pascal}
	       This is the pattern that recognizes comments according to the
	       Pascal ISO standard. This standard says that comments start
	       with either "{", or "(*", and end with "}" or "*)". This means
	       that "{*)" and "(*}" are considered to be comments. Many Pascal
	       applications don't allow this.  See
	       http://www.pascal-central.com/docs/iso10206.txt
	       <http://www.pascal-central.com/docs/iso10206.txt>

	   $RE{comment}{Alice}
	       The Alice Pascal compiler accepts comments that start with "{"
	       and end with "}". Comments are not allowed to contain newlines.
	       See <http://www.templetons.com/brad/alice/language/>.

	   $RE{comment}{Pascal}{Delphi}, $RE{comment}{Pascal}{Free} and
	   $RE{comment}{Pascal}{GPC}
	       The Delphi Pascal, Free Pascal and the Gnu Pascal Compiler
	       implementations of Pascal all have comments that either start
	       with "//" and last till the end of the line, are delimited with
	       "{" and "}" or are delimited with "(*" and "*)". Patterns for
	       those comments are given by $RE{comment}{Pascal}{Delphi},
	       $RE{comment}{Pascal}{Free} and $RE{comment}{Pascal}{GPC}
	       respectively. These patterns only set $1 when "{-keep}" is
	       used, which will then include the entire comment.

	       See <http://info.borland.com/techpubs/delphi5/oplg/>,
	       http://www.freepascal.org/docs-html/ref/ref.html
	       <http://www.freepascal.org/docs-html/ref/ref.html> and
	       http://www.gnu-pascal.de/gpc/ <http://www.gnu-pascal.de/gpc/>.

	   $RE{comment}{Pascal}{Workshop}
	       The Workshop Pascal compiler, from SUN Microsystems, allows
	       comments that are delimited with either "{" and "}", delimited
	       with "(*)" and "*"), delimited with "/*", and "*/", or starting
	       and ending with a double quote ("""). When "{-keep}" is used,
	       only $1 is set, and returns the entire comment.

	       See http://docs.sun.com/db/doc/802-5762
	       <http://docs.sun.com/db/doc/802-5762>.

	   only $1 is set, and is set to the entire comment. This pattern
	   needs at least Perl version 5.6.0. See
	   <http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~ug/slide/docs/slide/spec/spec_frame_intro.shtml>.

       slrn
	   Configuration files for slrn have comments starting with a "%" and
	   lasting the rest of the line.

       Smalltalk
	   Smalltalk uses comments that start and end with a double quote,
	   """.

       SMITH
	   Comments in the SMITH language start with ";", and last till the
	   end of the line.

       Squeak
	   In the Smalltalk variant Squeak, comments start and end with """.
	   Double quotes can appear inside comments by doubling them.

       SQL Standard SQL uses comments starting with two or more dashes, and
	   ending at the end of the line.

	   MySQL does not follow the standard. Instead, it allows comments
	   that start with a "#" or "-- " (that's two dashes and a space)
	   ending with the following newline, and comments starting with "/*",
	   and ending with the next ";" or "*/" that isn't inside single or
	   double quotes. A pattern for this is returned by
	   $RE{comment}{SQL}{MySQL}. With "{-keep}", only $1 will be set, and
	   it returns the entire comment.

       Tcl In Tcl, comments start with "#" and continue till the end of the
	   line.

       TeX The documentation language TeX uses comments starting with "%" and
	   ending at the end of the line.

       troff
	   The document formatting language troff uses comments starting with
	   "\"", and continuing till the end of the line.

       Ubercode
	   The Windows programming language Ubercode uses comments that start
	   with "//" and continue to the end of the line. See
	   <http://www.ubercode.com>.

       vi  In configuration files for the editor vi, one can use comments
	   starting with """, and ending at the end of the line.

       *W  In the language *W, comments start with "||", and end with "!!".

       zonefile
	   Comments in DNS zonefiles start with ";", and continue till the end
	   of the line.

       ZZT-OOP
	   The in-game language ZZT-OOP uses comments that start with a "'"
	   character, and end at the following newline. See
	   <http://dave2.rocketjump.org/rad/zzthelp/lang.html>.
