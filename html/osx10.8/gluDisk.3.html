NAME
       gluDisk - draw a disk


C SPECIFICATION
       void gluDisk( GLUquadric* quad,
		     GLdouble inner,
		     GLdouble outer,
		     GLint slices,
		     GLint loops )


PARAMETERS
       quad    Specifies the quadrics object (created with gluNewQuadric).

       inner   Specifies the inner radius of the disk (may be 0).

       outer   Specifies the outer radius of the disk.

       slices  Specifies the number of subdivisions around the z axis.

       loops   Specifies  the number of concentric rings about the origin into
	       which the disk is subdivided.

DESCRIPTION
       gluDisk renders a disk on the z = 0 plane. The disk  has  a  radius  of
       outer,  and contains a concentric circular hole with a radius of inner.
       If inner is 0, then no hole is generated. The disk is subdivided around
       the  z  axis into slices (like pizza slices), and also about the z axis
       into rings (as specified by slices and loops, respectively).

       With respect to orientation, the +z side of the disk is	considered  to
       be  "outside" (see gluQuadricOrientation).  This means that if the ori-
       entation is set to GLU_OUTSIDE, then any normals generated point  along
       the +z axis. Otherwise, they point along the -z axis.

       If texturing has been turned on (with gluQuadricTexture), texture coor-
       dinates are generated linearly such that where r = outer, the value  at
       (r, 0, 0) is (1, 0.5), at (0, r, 0) it is (0.5, 1), at (-r, 0, 0) it is
       (0, 0.5), and at (0, -r, 0) it is (0.5, 0).
