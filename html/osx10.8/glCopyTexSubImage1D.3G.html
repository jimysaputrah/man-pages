NAME
       glCopyTexSubImage1D - copy a one-dimensional texture subimage

C SPECIFICATION
       void glCopyTexSubImage1D(GLenum target, GLint level, GLint xoffset,
				GLint x, GLint y, GLsizei width);


PARAMETERS
       target
	   Specifies the target texture. Must be GL_TEXTURE_1D.

       level
	   Specifies the level-of-detail number. Level 0 is the base image
	   level. Level n is the nth mipmap reduction image.

       xoffset
	   Specifies the texel offset within the texture array.

       x, y
	   Specify the window coordinates of the left corner of the row of
	   pixels to be copied.

       width
	   Specifies the width of the texture subimage.

DESCRIPTION
       glCopyTexSubImage1D replaces a portion of a one-dimensional texture
       image with pixels from the current GL_READ_BUFFER (rather than from
       main memory, as is the case for glTexSubImage1D()).

       The screen-aligned pixel row with left corner at (x,\ y), and with
       length width replaces the portion of the texture array with x indices
       xoffset through xoffset + width - 1, inclusive. The destination in the
       texture array may not include any texels outside the texture array as
       it was originally specified.

       The pixels in the row are processed exactly as if glReadPixels() had
       been called, but the process stops just before final conversion. At
       this point, all pixel component values are clamped to the range 0 1 and
       then converted to the texture's internal format for storage in the
       texel array.

       It is not an error to specify a subtexture with zero width, but such a
       specification has no effect. If any of the pixels within the specified
       row of the current GL_READ_BUFFER are outside the read window
       associated with the current rendering context, then the values obtained
       for those pixels are undefined.

       No change is made to the internalformat, width, or border parameters of
       the specified texture array or to texel values outside the specified
       subregion.

NOTES
       The glPixelStore() mode affects texture images.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if /target is not GL_TEXTURE_1D.


       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if the texture array has not been
       defined by a previous glTexImage1D() or glCopyTexImage1D() operation.


       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if level is less than 0.


       GL_INVALID_VALUE may be generated if level &gt log 2 ai max, where max is
       the returned value of GL_MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE.


       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if xoffset &lt - b, or xoffset + width &gt w
       - b, where w is the GL_TEXTURE_WIDTH and b is the GL_TEXTURE_BORDER of
       the texture image being modified. Note that w includes twice the border
       width.
