NAME
       CHECKPOINT - force a transaction log checkpoint

SYNOPSIS
       CHECKPOINT

DESCRIPTION
       Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) puts a checkpoint in the transaction log
       every so often. (To adjust the automatic checkpoint interval, see the
       run-time configuration options checkpoint_segments and
       checkpoint_timeout.) The CHECKPOINT command forces an immediate
       checkpoint when the command is issued, without waiting for a scheduled
       checkpoint.

       A checkpoint is a point in the transaction log sequence at which all
       data files have been updated to reflect the information in the log. All
       data files will be flushed to disk. Refer to Chapter 29, Reliability
       and the Write-Ahead Log, in the documentation for more information
       about the WAL system.

       If executed during recovery, the CHECKPOINT command will force a
       restartpoint rather than writing a new checkpoint.

       Only superusers can call CHECKPOINT. The command is not intended for
       use during normal operation.

COMPATIBILITY
       The CHECKPOINT command is a PostgreSQL language extension.
