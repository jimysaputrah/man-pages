NAME
       Moose::Cookbook::Extending::Recipe2 - Providing a role for the base
       object class

SYNOPSIS
	 package MooseX::Debugging;

	 use Moose::Exporter;

	 Moose::Exporter-&gtsetup_import_methods(
	     base_class_roles =&gt ['MooseX::Debugging::Role::Object'],
	 );

	 package MooseX::Debugging::Role::Object;

	 use Moose::Role;

	 after 'BUILDALL' =&gt sub {
	     my $self = shift;

	     warn "Made a new " . ( ref $self ) . " object\n";
	 };

DESCRIPTION
       In this example, we provide a role for the base object class that adds
       some simple debugging output. Every time an object is created, it spits
       out a warning saying what type of object it was.

       Obviously, a real debugging role would do something more interesting,
       but this recipe is all about how we apply that role.

       In this case, with the combination of Moose::Exporter and
       Moose::Util::MetaRole, we ensure that when a module does
       "use MooseX::Debugging", it automatically gets the debugging role
       applied to its base object class.

       There are a few pieces of code worth looking at more closely.

	 Moose::Exporter-&gtsetup_import_methods(
	     base_class_roles =&gt ['MooseX::Debugging::Role::Object'],
	 );

       This creates an "import" method in the "MooseX::Debugging" package.
       Since we are not actually exporting anything, we do not pass
       "setup_import_methods" any parameters related to exports, but we need
       to have an "import" method to ensure that our "init_meta" method is
       called. The "init_meta" is created by "setup_import_methods" for us,
       since we passed the "base_class_roles" parameter. The generated
       "init_meta" will in turn call
       Moose::Util::MetaRole::apply_base_class_roles.
