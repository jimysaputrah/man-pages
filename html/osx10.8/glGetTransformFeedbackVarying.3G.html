NAME
       glGetTransformFeedbackVarying - retrieve information about varying
       variables selected for transform feedback

C SPECIFICATION
       void glGetTransformFeedbackVarying(GLuintprogram, GLuintindex,
					  GLsizeibufSize, GLsizei *length,
					  GLsizeisize, GLenum *type,
					  char *name);

PARAMETERS
       program
	   The name of the target program object.

       index
	   The index of the varying variable whose information to retrieve.

       bufSize
	   The maximum number of characters, including the null terminator,
	   that may be written into name.

       length
	   The address of a variable which will receive the number of
	   characters written into name, excluding the null-terminator. If
	   length is NULL no length is returned.

       size
	   The address of a variable that will receive the size of the
	   varying.

       type
	   The address of a variable that will recieve the type of the
	   varying.

       name
	   The address of a buffer into which will be written the name of the
	   varying.

DESCRIPTION
       Information about the set of varying variables in a linked program that
       will be captured during transform feedback may be retrieved by calling
       glGetTransformFeedbackVarying.  glGetTransformFeedbackVarying provides
       information about the varying variable selected by index. An index of 0
       selects the first varying variable specified in the varyings array
       passed to glTransformFeedbackVaryings(), and an index of
       GL_TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_VARYINGS-1 selects the last such variable.

       The name of the selected varying is returned as a null-terminated
       string in name. The actual number of characters written into name,
       excluding the null terminator, is returned in length. If length is
       NULL, no length is returned. The maximum number of characters that may
       be written into name, including the null terminator, is specified by
       bufSize.

       The length of the longest varying name in program is given by
       GL_TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_VARYING_MAX_LENGTH, which can be queried with
       glGetProgram().

       For the selected varying variable, its type is returned into type. The
       size of the varying is returned into size. The value in size is in
       units of the type returned in type. The type returned can be any of the
       scalar, vector, or matrix attribute types returned by
       glGetActiveAttrib(). If an error occurred, the return parameters
       length, size, type and name will be unmodified. This command will
       return as much information about the varying variables as possible. If
       no information is available, length will be set to zero and name will
       be an empty string. This situation could arise if
       glGetTransformFeedbackVarying is called after a failed link.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if program is not the name of a program
       object.


       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if index is greater or equal to the value
       of GL_TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_VARYINGS.


       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated program has not been linked.

ASSOCIATED GETS
       glGetProgram() with argument GL_TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_VARYING_MAX_LENGTH.
