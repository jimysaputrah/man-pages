NAME
       pwd - Return the absolute path of the current working directory

SYNOPSIS
       pwd
_________________________________________________________________


DESCRIPTION
       Returns the absolute path name of the current working directory.

EXAMPLE
       Sometimes it is useful to change to a known directory when running some
       external command using exec, but it is important to keep  the  applica-
       tion  usually  running  in the directory that it was started in (unless
       the user specifies otherwise) since that minimizes user confusion.  The
       way to do this is to save the current directory while the external com-
       mand is being run:
	      set tarFile [file normalize somefile.tar]
	      set savedDir [pwd]
	      cd /tmp
	      exec tar -xf $tarFile
	      cd $savedDir
