Module::Loaded(3pm)    Perl Programmers Reference Guide    Module::Loaded(3pm)



NAME
       Module::Loaded - mark modules as loaded or unloaded

SYNOPSIS
	   use Module::Loaded;

	   $bool = mark_as_loaded('Foo');   # Foo.pm is now marked as loaded
	   $loc  = is_loaded('Foo');	    # location of Foo.pm set to the
					    # loaders location
	   eval "require 'Foo'";	    # is now a no-op

	   $bool = mark_as_unloaded('Foo'); # Foo.pm no longer marked as loaded
	   eval "require 'Foo'";	    # Will try to find Foo.pm in @INC

DESCRIPTION
       When testing applications, often you find yourself needing to provide
       functionality in your test environment that would usually be provided
       by external modules. Rather than munging the %INC by hand to mark these
       external modules as loaded, so they are not attempted to be loaded by
       perl, this module offers you a very simple way to mark modules as
       loaded and/or unloaded.

FUNCTIONS
   $bool = mark_as_loaded( PACKAGE );
       Marks the package as loaded to perl. "PACKAGE" can be a bareword or
       string.

       If the module is already loaded, "mark_as_loaded" will carp about this
       and tell you from where the "PACKAGE" has been loaded already.

   $bool = mark_as_unloaded( PACKAGE );
       Marks the package as unloaded to perl, which is the exact opposite of
       "mark_as_loaded". "PACKAGE" can be a bareword or string.

       If the module is already unloaded, "mark_as_unloaded" will carp about
       this and tell you the "PACKAGE" has been unloaded already.

   $loc = is_loaded( PACKAGE );
       "is_loaded" tells you if "PACKAGE" has been marked as loaded yet.
       "PACKAGE" can be a bareword or string.

       It returns falls if "PACKAGE" has not been loaded yet and the location
       from where it is said to be loaded on success.
