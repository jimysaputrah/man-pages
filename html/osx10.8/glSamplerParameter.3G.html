DESCRIPTION
       glSamplerParameter assigns the value or values in params to the sampler
       parameter specified as pname.  sampler specifies the sampler object to
       be modified, and must be the name of a sampler object previously
       returned from a call to glGenSamplers(). The following symbols are
       accepted in pname:

       GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER
	   The texture minifying function is used whenever the pixel being
	   textured maps to an area greater than one texture element. There
	   are six defined minifying functions. Two of them use the nearest
	   one or nearest four texture elements to compute the texture value.
	   The other four use mipmaps.

	   A mipmap is an ordered set of arrays representing the same image at
	   progressively lower resolutions. If the texture has dimensions 2 n
	   x 2 m, there are max ai n m + 1 mipmaps. The first mipmap is the
	   original texture, with dimensions 2 n x 2 m. Each subsequent mipmap
	   has dimensions 2 k - 1 x 2 l - 1, where 2 k x 2 l are the
	   dimensions of the previous mipmap, until either k = 0 or l = 0. At
	   that point, subsequent mipmaps have dimension 1 x 2 l - 1 or 2 k -
	   1 x 1 until the final mipmap, which has dimension 1 x 1. To define
	   the mipmaps, call glTexImage1D(), glTexImage2D(), glTexImage3D(),
	   glCopyTexImage1D(), or glCopyTexImage2D() with the level argument
	   indicating the order of the mipmaps. Level 0 is the original
	   texture; level max ai n m is the final 1 x 1 mipmap.


	   params supplies a function for minifying the texture as one of the
	   following:

	   GL_NEAREST
	       Returns the value of the texture element that is nearest (in
	       Manhattan distance) to the center of the pixel being textured.

	   GL_LINEAR
	       Returns the weighted average of the four texture elements that
	       are closest to the center of the pixel being textured. These
	       can include border texture elements, depending on the values of
	       GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_S and GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_T, and on the exact
	       mapping.

	   GL_NEAREST_MIPMAP_NEAREST
	       Chooses the mipmap that most closely matches the size of the
	       pixel being textured and uses the GL_NEAREST criterion (the
	       texture element nearest to the center of the pixel) to produce
	       a texture value.

	   GL_LINEAR_MIPMAP_NEAREST
	       Chooses the mipmap that most closely matches the size of the
	       pixel being textured and uses the GL_LINEAR criterion (a
	       weighted average of the four texture elements that are closest
	       to the center of the pixel) to produce a texture value.

	   GL_NEAREST_MIPMAP_LINEAR
	       Chooses the two mipmaps that most closely match the size of the
	       pixel being textured and uses the GL_NEAREST criterion (the
	       texture element nearest to the center of the pixel) to produce
	       a texture value from each mipmap. The final texture value is a
	       weighted average of those two values.

	   GL_LINEAR_MIPMAP_LINEAR
	       Chooses the two mipmaps that most closely match the size of the
	       pixel being textured and uses the GL_LINEAR criterion (a
	       weighted average of the four texture elements that are closest
	       to the center of the pixel) to produce a texture value from
	       each mipmap. The final texture value is a weighted average of
	       those two values.

	   As more texture elements are sampled in the minification process,
	   fewer aliasing artifacts will be apparent. While the GL_NEAREST and
	   GL_LINEAR minification functions can be faster than the other four,
	   they sample only one or four texture elements to determine the
	   texture value of the pixel being rendered and can produce moire
	   patterns or ragged transitions. The initial value of
	   GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER is GL_NEAREST_MIPMAP_LINEAR.

       GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER
	   The texture magnification function is used when the pixel being
	   textured maps to an area less than or equal to one texture element.
	   It sets the texture magnification function to either GL_NEAREST or
	   GL_LINEAR (see below).  GL_NEAREST is generally faster than
	   GL_LINEAR, but it can produce textured images with sharper edges
	   because the transition between texture elements is not as smooth.
	   The initial value of GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER is GL_LINEAR.

	   GL_NEAREST
	       Returns the value of the texture element that is nearest (in
	       Manhattan distance) to the center of the pixel being textured.

	   GL_LINEAR
	       Returns the weighted average of the four texture elements that
	       are closest to the center of the pixel being textured. These
	       can include border texture elements, depending on the values of
	       GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_S and GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_T, and on the exact
	       mapping.




       GL_TEXTURE_MIN_LOD
	   Sets the minimum level-of-detail parameter. This floating-point
	   value limits the selection of highest resolution mipmap (lowest
	   mipmap level). The initial value is -1000.


       GL_TEXTURE_MAX_LOD
	   Sets the maximum level-of-detail parameter. This floating-point
	   value limits the selection of the lowest resolution mipmap (highest
	   mipmap level). The initial value is 1000.


       GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_S
	   Sets the wrap parameter for texture coordinate s to either
	   GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE, GL_MIRRORED_REPEAT, or GL_REPEAT.
	   GL_CLAMP_TO_BORDER causes the s coordinate to be clamped to the
	   range -1 2N 1 + 1 2N, where N is the size of the texture in the
	   direction of clamping.GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE causes s coordinates to be
	   clamped to the range 1 2N 1 - 1 2N, where N is the size of the
	   texture in the direction of clamping.  GL_REPEAT causes the integer
	   part of the s coordinate to be ignored; the GL uses only the
	   fractional part, thereby creating a repeating pattern.
	   GL_MIRRORED_REPEAT causes the s coordinate to be set to the
	   fractional part of the texture coordinate if the integer part of s
	   is even; if the integer part of s is odd, then the s texture
	   coordinate is set to 1 - frac ai s, where frac ai s represents the
	   fractional part of s. Initially, GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_S is set to
	   GL_REPEAT.


       GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_T
	   Sets the wrap parameter for texture coordinate t to either
	   GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE, GL_MIRRORED_REPEAT, or GL_REPEAT. See the
	   discussion under GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_S. Initially, GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_T is
	   set to GL_REPEAT.

       GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_R
	   Sets the wrap parameter for texture coordinate r to either
	   GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE, GL_MIRRORED_REPEAT, or GL_REPEAT. See the
	   discussion under GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_S. Initially, GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_R is
	   set to GL_REPEAT.

       GL_TEXTURE_BORDER_COLOR
	   The data in params specifies four values that define the border
	   values that should be used for border texels. If a texel is sampled
	   from the border of the texture, the values of
	   GL_TEXTURE_BORDER_COLOR are interpreted as an RGBA color to match
	   the texture's internal format and substituted for the non-existent
	   texel data. If the texture contains depth components, the first
	   component of GL_TEXTURE_BORDER_COLOR is interpreted as a depth
	   value. The initial value is 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0.

       GL_TEXTURE_COMPARE_MODE
	   Specifies the texture comparison mode for currently bound textures.
	   That is, a texture whose internal format is GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT_*;
	   see glTexImage2D()) Permissible values are:

	   GL_COMPARE_REF_TO_TEXTURE
	       Specifies that the interpolated and clamped r texture
	       coordinate should be compared to the value in the currently
	       bound texture. See the discussion of GL_TEXTURE_COMPARE_FUNC
	       for details of how the comparison is evaluated. The result of
	       the comparison is assigned to the red channel.

	   GL_NONE
	       Specifies that the red channel should be assigned the
	       appropriate value from the currently bound texture.


       GL_TEXTURE_COMPARE_FUNC
	   Specifies the comparison operator used when GL_TEXTURE_COMPARE_MODE
	   is set to GL_COMPARE_REF_TO_TEXTURE. Permissible values are:

NOTES
       glSamplerParameter is available only if the GL version is 3.3 or
       higher.

       If a sampler object is bound to a texture unit and that unit is used to
       sample from a texture, the parameters in the sampler are used to sample
       from the texture, rather than the equivalent parameters in the texture
       object bound to that unit. This introduces the possibility of sampling
       from the same texture object with different sets of sampler state,
       which may lead to a condition where a texture is incomplete with
       respect to one sampler object and not with respect to another. Thus,
       completeness can be considered a function of a sampler object and a
       texture object bound to a single texture unit, rather than a property
       of the texture object itself.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if sampler is not the name of a sampler
       object previously returned from a call to glGenSamplers().


       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if params should have a defined constant
       value (based on the value of pname) and does not.
