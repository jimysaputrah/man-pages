NAME
       DROP_OWNED - remove database objects owned by a database role

SYNOPSIS
       DROP OWNED BY name [, ...] [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ]

DESCRIPTION
       DROP OWNED drops all the objects in the current database that are owned
       by one of the specified roles. Any privileges granted to the given
       roles on objects in the current database will also be revoked.

PARAMETERS
       name
	   The name of a role whose objects will be dropped, and whose
	   privileges will be revoked.

       CASCADE
	   Automatically drop objects that depend on the affected objects.

       RESTRICT
	   Refuse to drop the objects owned by a role if any other database
	   objects depend on one of the affected objects. This is the default.

NOTES
       DROP OWNED is often used to prepare for the removal of one or more
       roles. Because DROP OWNED only affects the objects in the current
       database, it is usually necessary to execute this command in each
       database that contains objects owned by a role that is to be removed.

       Using the CASCADE option might make the command recurse to objects
       owned by other users.

       The REASSIGN OWNED (REASSIGN_OWNED(7)) command is an alternative that
       reassigns the ownership of all the database objects owned by one or
       more roles.

       Databases owned by the role(s) will not be removed.

COMPATIBILITY
       The DROP OWNED statement is a PostgreSQL extension.
