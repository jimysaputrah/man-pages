NAME
       Class::MOP - A Meta Object Protocol for Perl 5

VERSION
       version 2.0205

DESCRIPTION
       This module is a fully functioning meta object protocol for the Perl 5
       object system. It makes no attempt to change the behavior or
       characteristics of the Perl 5 object system, only to create a protocol
       for its manipulation and introspection.

       That said, it does attempt to create the tools for building a rich set
       of extensions to the Perl 5 object system. Every attempt has been made
       to abide by the spirit of the Perl 5 object system that we all know and
       love.

       This documentation is sparse on conceptual details. We suggest looking
       at the items listed in the "SEE ALSO" section for more information. In
       particular the book "The Art of the Meta Object Protocol" was very
       influential in the development of this system.

   What is a Meta Object Protocol?
       A meta object protocol is an API to an object system.

       To be more specific, it abstracts the components of an object system
       (classes, object, methods, object attributes, etc.). These abstractions
       can then be used to inspect and manipulate the object system which they
       describe.

       It can be said that there are two MOPs for any object system; the
       implicit MOP and the explicit MOP. The implicit MOP handles things like
       method dispatch or inheritance, which happen automatically as part of
       how the object system works. The explicit MOP typically handles the
       introspection/reflection features of the object system.

       All object systems have implicit MOPs. Without one, they would not
       work. Explicit MOPs are much less common, and depending on the language
       can vary from restrictive (Reflection in Java or C#) to wide open (CLOS
       is a perfect example).

   Yet Another Class Builder! Why?
       This is not a class builder so much as a class builder builder. The
       intent is that an end user will not use this module directly, but
       instead this module is used by module authors to build extensions and
       features onto the Perl 5 object system.

       This system is used by Moose, which supplies a powerful class builder
       system built entirely on top of "Class::MOP".

   Who is this module for?
       This module is for anyone who has ever created or wanted to create a
       module for the Class:: namespace. The tools which this module provides
       make doing complex Perl 5 wizardry simpler, by removing such barriers
       as the need to hack symbol tables, or understand the fine details of
       method dispatch.

   What changes do I have to make to use this module?
       This module was designed to be as unintrusive as possible. Many of its
       features are accessible without any change to your existing code. It is
       meant to be a compliment to your existing code and not an intrusion on
       your code base. Unlike many other Class:: modules, this module does not
       require you subclass it, or even that you "use" it in within your
       module's package.

       The only features which requires additions to your code are the
       attribute handling and instance construction features, and these are
       both completely optional features. The only reason for this is because
       Perl 5's object system does not actually have these features built in.
       More information about this feature can be found below.

   About Performance
       It is a common misconception that explicit MOPs are a performance hit.
       This is not a universal truth, it is a side-effect of some specific
       implementations. For instance, using Java reflection is slow because
       the JVM cannot take advantage of any compiler optimizations, and the
       JVM has to deal with much more runtime type information as well.

       Reflection in C# is marginally better as it was designed into the
       language and runtime (the CLR). In contrast, CLOS (the Common Lisp
       Object System) was built to support an explicit MOP, and so performance
       is tuned for it.

       This library in particular does its absolute best to avoid putting any
       drain at all upon your code's performance. In fact, by itself it does
       nothing to affect your existing code. So you only pay for what you
       actually use.

   About Metaclass compatibility
       This module makes sure that all metaclasses created are both upwards
       and downwards compatible. The topic of metaclass compatibility is
       highly esoteric and is something only encountered when doing deep and
       involved metaclass hacking. There are two basic kinds of metaclass
       incompatibility; upwards and downwards.

       Upwards metaclass compatibility means that the metaclass of a given
       class is either the same as (or a subclass of) all of the class's
       ancestors.

       Downward metaclass compatibility means that the metaclasses of a given
       class's ancestors are all either the same as (or a subclass of) that
       metaclass.

       Here is a diagram showing a set of two classes ("A" and "B") and two
       metaclasses ("Meta::A" and "Meta::B") which have correct metaclass
       compatibility both upwards and downwards.

	   +---------+	   +---------+
	   | Meta::A |&lt----| Meta::B |	    &lt....... (instance of  )
	   +---------+	   +---------+	    &lt------- (inherits from)
		^		^
		:		:
	   +---------+	   +---------+
	   |	A    |&lt----|	B    |
	   +---------+	   +---------+

       In actuality, all of a class's metaclasses must be compatible, not just
       the class metaclass. That includes the instance, attribute, and method
       metaclasses, as well as the constructor and destructor classes.

       "Class::MOP" will attempt to fix some simple types of
       incompatibilities. If all the metaclasses for the parent class are
       subclasses of the child's metaclasses then we can simply replace the
       child's metaclasses with the parent's. In addition, if the child is
       missing a metaclass that the parent has, we can also just make the
       child use the parent's metaclass.

       As I said this is a highly esoteric topic and one you will only run
       into if you do a lot of subclassing of Class::MOP::Class. If you are
       interested in why this is an issue see the paper Uniform and safe
       metaclass composition linked to in the "SEE ALSO" section of this
       document.

   Using custom metaclasses
       Always use the metaclass pragma when using a custom metaclass, this
       will ensure the proper initialization order and not accidentally create
       an incorrect type of metaclass for you. This is a very rare problem,
       and one which can only occur if you are doing deep metaclass
       programming. So in other words, don't worry about it.

       Note that if you're using Moose we encourage you to not use metaclass
       pragma, and instead use Moose::Util::MetaRole to apply roles to a
       class's metaclasses. This topic is covered at length in various
       Moose::Cookbook recipes.

PROTOCOLS
       The meta-object protocol is divided into 4 main sub-protocols:

   The Class protocol
       This provides a means of manipulating and introspecting a Perl 5 class.
       It handles symbol table hacking for you, and provides a rich set of
       methods that go beyond simple package introspection.

       See Class::MOP::Class for more details.

   The Attribute protocol
       This provides a consistent representation for an attribute of a Perl 5
       class. Since there are so many ways to create and handle attributes in
       Perl 5 OO, the Attribute protocol provide as much of a unified approach
       as possible. Of course, you are always free to extend this protocol by
       subclassing the appropriate classes.

       See Class::MOP::Attribute for more details.

   The Method protocol
       This provides a means of manipulating and introspecting methods in the
       Perl 5 object system. As with attributes, there are many ways to
       approach this topic, so we try to keep it pretty basic, while still
       making it possible to extend the system in many ways.

       See Class::MOP::Method for more details.

   The Instance protocol
       This provides a layer of abstraction for creating object instances.
       Since the other layers use this protocol, it is relatively easy to
       change the type of your instances from the default hash reference to
       some other type of reference. Several examples are provided in the
       examples/ directory included in this distribution.

       See Class::MOP::Instance for more details.

FUNCTIONS
       Note that this module does not export any constants or functions.

   Utility functions
       Note that these are all called as functions, not methods.

       Class::MOP::load_class($class_name, \%options?)
	   This will load the specified $class_name, if it is not already
	   loaded (as reported by "is_class_loaded"). This function can be
	   used in place of tricks like "eval "use $module"" or using
	   "require" unconditionally.

	   If the module cannot be loaded, an exception is thrown.

	   You can pass a hash reference with options as second argument. The
	   only option currently recognized is "-version", which will ensure
	   that the loaded class has at least the required version.

	   For historical reasons, this function explicitly returns a true
	   value.

       Class::MOP::is_class_loaded($class_name, \%options?)
	   Returns a boolean indicating whether or not $class_name has been
	   loaded.

	   This does a basic check of the symbol table to try and determine as
	   best it can if the $class_name is loaded, it is probably correct
	   about 99% of the time, but it can be fooled into reporting false
	   positives. In particular, loading any of the core IO modules will
	   cause most of the rest of the core IO modules to falsely report
	   having been loaded, due to the way the base IO module works.

	   You can pass a hash reference with options as second argument. The
	   only option currently recognized is "-version", which will ensure
	   that the loaded class has at least the required version.

       Class::MOP::get_code_info($code)
	   This function returns two values, the name of the package the $code
	   is from and the name of the $code itself. This is used by several
	   elements of the MOP to determine where a given $code reference is
	   from.

       Class::MOP::class_of($instance_or_class_name)
	   This will return the metaclass of the given instance or class name.
	   If the class lacks a metaclass, no metaclass will be initialized,
	   and "undef" will be returned.

   Metaclass cache functions
       Class::MOP holds a cache of metaclasses. The following are functions
       (not methods) which can be used to access that cache. It is not
       recommended that you mess with these. Bad things could happen, but if
       you are brave and willing to risk it: go for it!

       Class::MOP::get_all_metaclasses
	   This will return a hash of all the metaclass instances that have
	   been cached by Class::MOP::Class, keyed by the package name.

       Class::MOP::get_all_metaclass_instances
	   This will return a list of all the metaclass instances that have
	   been cached by Class::MOP::Class.

       Class::MOP::get_all_metaclass_names
	   This will return a list of all the metaclass names that have been
	   cached by Class::MOP::Class.

       Class::MOP::get_metaclass_by_name($name)
	   This will return a cached Class::MOP::Class instance, or nothing if
	   no metaclass exists with that $name.

       Class::MOP::store_metaclass_by_name($name, $meta)
	   This will store a metaclass in the cache at the supplied $key.

       Class::MOP::weaken_metaclass($name)
	   In rare cases (e.g. anonymous metaclasses) it is desirable to store
	   a weakened reference in the metaclass cache. This function will
	   weaken the reference to the metaclass stored in $name.

       Class::MOP::metaclass_is_weak($name)
	   Returns true if the metaclass for $name has been weakened (via
	   "weaken_metaclass").

       Class::MOP::does_metaclass_exist($name)
	   This will return true of there exists a metaclass stored in the
	   $name key, and return false otherwise.

       Class::MOP::remove_metaclass_by_name($name)
	   This will remove the metaclass stored in the $name key.

SEE ALSO
   Books
       There are very few books out on Meta Object Protocols and Metaclasses
       because it is such an esoteric topic. The following books are really
       the only ones I have found. If you know of any more, please email me
       and let me know, I would love to hear about them.

   Papers
       "Uniform and safe metaclass composition"
	   An excellent paper by the people who brought us the original Traits
	   paper.  This paper is on how Traits can be used to do safe
	   metaclass composition, and offers an excellent introduction section
	   which delves into the topic of metaclass compatibility.

       "Safe Metaclass Programming"
	   This paper seems to precede the above paper, and propose a mix-in
	   based approach as opposed to the Traits based approach. Both papers
	   have similar information on the metaclass compatibility problem
	   space.

SIMILAR MODULES
       As I have said above, this module is a class-builder-builder, so it is
       not the same thing as modules like Class::Accessor and
       Class::MethodMaker. That being said there are very few modules on CPAN
       with similar goals to this module. The one I have found which is most
       like this module is Class::Meta, although its philosophy and the MOP it
       creates are very different from this modules.

BUGS
       All complex software has bugs lurking in it, and this module is no
       exception.

       Please report any bugs to "bug-class-mop@rt.cpan.org", or through the
       web interface at &lthttp://rt.cpan.org&gt.

       You can also discuss feature requests or possible bugs on the Moose
