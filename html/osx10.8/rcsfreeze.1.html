NAME
       rcsfreeze - freeze a configuration of sources checked in under RCS

SYNOPSIS
       rcsfreeze [name]

DESCRIPTION
       rcsfreeze assigns a symbolic revision number to a set of RCS files that
       form a valid configuration.

       The idea is to run rcsfreeze each time a new version is checked in.   A
       unique  symbolic  name  (C_number,  where number is increased each time
       rcsfreeze is run) is then assigned to the most recent revision of  each
       RCS file of the main trunk.

       An  optional  name  argument  to rcsfreeze gives a symbolic name to the
       configuration.  The unique identifier is still generated and is	listed
       in the log file but it will not appear as part of the symbolic revision
       name in the actual RCS files.

       A log message is requested from the user for future reference.

       The shell script works only on all RCS files at one time.  All  changed
       files  must  be	checked  in  already.	Run  rcsclean(1) first and see
       whether any sources remain in the current directory.

FILES
       RCS/.rcsfreeze.ver
	      version number

       RCS/.rcsfreeze.log
	      log messages, most recent first

BUGS
       rcsfreeze does not check whether any sources are checked out and  modi-
       fied.

       Although  both  source file names and RCS file names are accepted, they
       are not paired as usual with RCS commands.

       Error checking is rudimentary.

       rcsfreeze is just an optional example shell script, and should  not  be
       taken too seriously.  See CVS for a more complete solution.
