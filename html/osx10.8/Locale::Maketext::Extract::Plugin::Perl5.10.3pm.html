NAME
       Locale::Maketext::Extract::Plugin::Perl - Perl format parser

SYNOPSIS
	   $plugin = Locale::Maketext::Extract::Plugin::Perl-&gtnew(
	       $lexicon 	   # A Locale::Maketext::Extract object
	       @file_types	   # Optionally specify a list of recognised file types
	   )

	   $plugin-&gtextract($filename,$filecontents);

DESCRIPTION
       Extracts strings to localise (including HEREDOCS and concatenated
       strings) from Perl code.

       This Perl parser is very fast and very good, but not perfect - it does
       make mistakes. The PPI parser (Locale::Maketext::Extract::Plugin::PPI)
       is more accurate, but a lot slower, and so is not enabled by default.

SHORT PLUGIN NAME
	   perl

VALID FORMATS
       Valid localization function names are:

       translate
       maketext
       gettext
       loc
       x
       _
       __

KNOWN FILE TYPES
       .pm
       .pl
       .cgi

SEE ALSO
       xgettext.pl
	   for extracting translatable strings from common template systems
	   and perl source files.
