NAME
       SSL_CTX_set_mode, SSL_set_mode, SSL_CTX_get_mode, SSL_get_mode -
       manipulate SSL engine mode

SYNOPSIS
	#include <openssl/ssl.h>

	long SSL_CTX_set_mode(SSL_CTX *ctx, long mode);
	long SSL_set_mode(SSL *ssl, long mode);

	long SSL_CTX_get_mode(SSL_CTX *ctx);
	long SSL_get_mode(SSL *ssl);

DESCRIPTION
       SSL_CTX_set_mode() adds the mode set via bitmask in mode to ctx.
       Options already set before are not cleared.

       SSL_set_mode() adds the mode set via bitmask in mode to ssl.  Options
       already set before are not cleared.

       SSL_CTX_get_mode() returns the mode set for ctx.

       SSL_get_mode() returns the mode set for ssl.

NOTES
       The following mode changes are available:

       SSL_MODE_ENABLE_PARTIAL_WRITE
	   Allow SSL_write(..., n) to return r with 0 < r < n (i.e. report
	   success when just a single record has been written). When not set
	   (the default), SSL_write() will only report success once the
	   complete chunk was written.	Once SSL_write() returns with r, r
	   bytes have been successfully written and the next call to
	   SSL_write() must only send the n-r bytes left, imitating the
	   behaviour of write().

       SSL_MODE_ACCEPT_MOVING_WRITE_BUFFER
	   Make it possible to retry SSL_write() with changed buffer location
	   (the buffer contents must stay the same). This is not the default
	   to avoid the misconception that non-blocking SSL_write() behaves
	   like non-blocking write().

       SSL_MODE_AUTO_RETRY
	   Never bother the application with retries if the transport is
	   blocking.  If a renegotiation take place during normal operation, a
	   SSL_read(3) or SSL_write(3) would return with -1 and indicate the
	   need to retry with SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ.  In a non-blocking
	   environment applications must be prepared to handle incomplete
	   read/write operations.  In a blocking environment, applications are
	   not always prepared to deal with read/write operations returning
	   without success report. The flag SSL_MODE_AUTO_RETRY will cause
	   read/write operations to only return after the handshake and
	   successful completion.

RETURN VALUES
       SSL_CTX_set_mode() and SSL_set_mode() return the new mode bitmask after
       adding mode.

       SSL_CTX_get_mode() and SSL_get_mode() return the current bitmask.

SEE ALSO
       ssl(3), SSL_read(3), SSL_write(3)

HISTORY
       SSL_MODE_AUTO_RETRY as been added in OpenSSL 0.9.6.
