NAME
       glClearBuffer - clear individual buffers of the currently bound draw
       framebuffer

C SPECIFICATION
       void glClearBufferiv(GLenum buffer, GLint drawBuffer,
			    const GLint * value);

       void glClearBufferuiv(GLenum buffer, GLint drawBuffer,
			     const GLuint * value);

       void glClearBufferfv(GLenum buffer, GLint drawBuffer,
			    const GLfloat * value);

       void glClearBufferfi(GLenum buffer, GLint drawBuffer, GLfloat depth,
			    GLint stencil);

PARAMETERS
       buffer
	   Specify the buffer to clear.

       drawBuffer
	   Specify a particular draw buffer to clear.

       value
	   For color buffers, a pointer to a four-element vector specifying R,
	   G, B and A values to clear the buffer to. For depth buffers, a
	   pointer to a single depth value to clear the buffer to. For stencil
	   buffers, a pointer to a single stencil value to clear the buffer
	   to.

       depth
	   The value to clear a depth render buffer to.

       stencil
	   The value to clear a stencil render buffer to.

DESCRIPTION
       glClearBuffer* clears the specified buffer to the specified value(s).
       If buffer is GL_COLOR, a particular draw buffer GL_DRAWBUFFERi is
       specified by passing i as drawBuffer. In this case, value points to a
       four-element vector specifying the R, G, B and A color to clear that
       draw buffer to. If buffer is one of GL_FRONT, GL_BACK, GL_LEFT,
       GL_RIGHT, or GL_FRONT_AND_BACK, identifying multiple buffers, each
       selected buffer is cleared to the same value. Clamping and conversion
       for fixed-point color buffers are performed in the same fashion as
       glClearColor().

       If buffer is GL_DEPTH, drawBuffer must be zero, and value points to a
       single value to clear the depth buffer to. Only glClearBufferfv should
       be used to clear depth buffers. Clamping and conversion for fixed-point
       depth buffers are performed in the same fashion as glClearDepth().

       If buffer is GL_STENCIL, drawBuffer must be zero, and value points to a
       single value to clear the stencil buffer to. Only glClearBufferiv
       should be used to clear stencil buffers. Masing and type conversion are
       performed in the same fashion as glClearStencil().


       glClearBufferfi may be used to clear the depth and stencil buffers.
       buffer must be GL_DEPTH_STENCIL and drawBuffer must be zero.  depth and
       stencil are the depth and stencil values, respectively.

       The result of glClearBuffer is undefined if no conversion between the
       type of value and the buffer being cleared is defined. However, this is
       not an error.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated by glClearBufferif, glClearBufferfv and
       glClearBufferuiv if buffer is not GL_COLOR, GL_FRONT, GL_BACK, GL_LEFT,
       GL_RIGHT, GL_FRONT_AND_BACK, GL_DEPTH or GL_STENCIL.


       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated by glClearBufferfi if buffer is not
       GL_DEPTH_STENCIL.


       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if buffer is GL_COLOR, GL_FRONT, GL_BACK,
       GL_LEFT, GL_RIGHT, or GL_FRONT_AND_BACK and drawBuffer is greater than
       or equal to GL_MAX_DRAW_BUFFERS.


       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if buffer is GL_DEPTH, GL_STENCIL or
       GL_DEPTH_STENCIL and drawBuffer is not zero.
