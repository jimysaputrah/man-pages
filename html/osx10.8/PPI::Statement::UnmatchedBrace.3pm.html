DESCRIPTION
       The "PPI::Statement::UnmatchedBrace" class is a miscellaneous utility
       class. Objects of this type should be rare, or not exist at all in
       normal valid PPI::Document objects.

       It can be either a round ')', square ']' or curly '}' brace, this class
       does not distinguish. Objects of this type are only allocated at a
       structural level, not a lexical level (as they are lexically invalid
       anyway).

       The presence of a "PPI::Statement::UnmatchedBrace" indicated a broken
       or invalid document. Or maybe a bug in PPI, but far more likely a
       broken Document. :)

METHODS
       "PPI::Statement::UnmatchedBrace" has no additional methods beyond the
       default ones provided by PPI::Statement, PPI::Node and PPI::Element.

SUPPORT
       See the support section in the main module.
