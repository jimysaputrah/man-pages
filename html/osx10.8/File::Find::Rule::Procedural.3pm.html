NAME
       File::Find::Rule::Procedural - File::Find::Rule's procedural interface

SYNOPSIS
	 use File::Find::Rule;

	 # find all .pm files, procedurally
	 my @files = find(file => name => '*.pm', in => \@INC);

DESCRIPTION
       In addition to the regular object-oriented interface, File::Find::Rule
       provides two subroutines for you to use.

       "find( @clauses )"
       "rule( @clauses )"
	   "find" and "rule" can be used to invoke any methods available to
	   the OO version.  "rule" is a synonym for "find"

       Passing more than one value to a clause is done with an anonymous
       array:

	my $finder = find( name => [ '*.mp3', '*.ogg' ] );

       "find" and "rule" both return a File::Find::Rule instance, unless one
       of the arguments is "in", in which case it returns a list of things
       that match the rule.

	my @files = find( name => [ '*.mp3', '*.ogg' ], in => $ENV{HOME} );

       Please note that "in" will be the last clause evaluated, and so this
       code will search for mp3s regardless of size.

	my @files = find( name => '*.mp3', in => $ENV{HOME}, size => '<2k' );
							   ^
							   |
		      Clause processing stopped here ------/

       It is also possible to invert a single rule by prefixing it with "!"
       like so:

	# large files that aren't videos
	my @files = find( file	  =>
			  '!name' => [ '*.avi', '*.mov' ],
			  size	  => '>20M',
			  in	  => $ENV{HOME} );
