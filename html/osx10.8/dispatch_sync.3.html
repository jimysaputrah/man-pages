dispatch_async(3)	 BSD Library Functions Manual	     dispatch_async(3)

NAME
     dispatch_async, dispatch_sync -- schedule blocks for execution

SYNOPSIS
     #include <dispatch/dispatch.h>

     void
     dispatch_async(dispatch_queue_t queue, void (^block)(void));

     void
     dispatch_sync(dispatch_queue_t queue, void (^block)(void));

     void
     dispatch_async_f(dispatch_queue_t queue, void *context,
	 void (*function)(void *));

     void
     dispatch_sync_f(dispatch_queue_t queue, void *context,
	 void (*function)(void *));

DESCRIPTION
     The dispatch_async() and dispatch_sync() functions schedule blocks for
     concurrent execution within the dispatch(3) framework. Blocks are submit-
     ted to a queue which dictates the policy for their execution. See
     dispatch_queue_create(3) for more information about creating dispatch
     queues.

     These functions support efficient temporal synchronization, background
     concurrency and data-level concurrency. These same functions can also be
     used for efficient notification of the completion of asynchronous blocks
     (a.k.a.  callbacks).

TEMPORAL SYNCHRONIZATION
     Synchronization is often required when multiple threads of execution
     access shared data concurrently. The simplest form of synchronization is
     mutual-exclusion (a lock), whereby different subsystems execute concur-
     rently until a shared critical section is entered. In the pthread(3) fam-
     ily of procedures, temporal synchronization is accomplished like so:

	   int r = pthread_mutex_lock(&my_lock);
	   assert(r == 0);

	   // critical section

	   r = pthread_mutex_unlock(&my_lock);
	   assert(r == 0);

     The dispatch_sync() function may be used with a serial queue to accom-
     plish the same style of synchronization. For example:

	   dispatch_sync(my_queue, ^{
		   // critical section
	   });

     In addition to providing a more concise expression of synchronization,
     this approach is less error prone as the critical section cannot be acci-
     dentally left without restoring the queue to a reentrant state.

     The dispatch_async() function may be used to implement deferred critical
     sections when the result of the block is not needed locally. Deferred
     critical sections have the same synchronization properties as the above
     code, but are non-blocking and therefore more efficient to perform. For
     example:

     dispatch_async(my_queue, ^{
	     // critical section
     });

BACKGROUND CONCURRENCY
     dispatch_async() function may be used to execute trivial backgound tasks
     on a global concurrent queue. For example:

     dispatch_async(dispatch_get_global_queue(DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_DEFAULT,0), ^{
	     // background operation
     });

     This approach is an efficient replacement for pthread_create(3).

COMPLETION CALLBACKS
     Completion callbacks can be accomplished via nested calls to the
     dispatch_async() function. It is important to remember to retain the des-
     tination queue before the first call to dispatch_async(), and to release
     that queue at the end of the completion callback to ensure the destina-
     tion queue is not deallocated while the completion callback is pending.
     For example:

     void
     async_read(object_t obj,
	     void *where, size_t bytes,
	     dispatch_queue_t destination_queue,
	     void (^reply_block)(ssize_t r, int err))
     {
	     // There are better ways of doing async I/O.
	     // This is just an example of nested blocks.

	     dispatch_retain(destination_queue);

	     dispatch_async(obj->queue, ^{
		     ssize_t r = read(obj->fd, where, bytes);
		     int err = errno;

		     dispatch_async(destination_queue, ^{
			     reply_block(r, err);
		     });
		     dispatch_release(destination_queue);
	     });
     }

RECURSIVE LOCKS
     While dispatch_sync() can replace a lock, it cannot replace a recursive
     lock. Unlike locks, queues support both asynchronous and synchronous
     operations, and those operations are ordered by definition. A recursive
     call to dispatch_sync() causes a simple deadlock as the currently execut-
     ing block waits for the next block to complete, but the next block will
     not start until the currently running block completes.

     As the dispatch framework was designed, we studied recursive locks. We
     found that the vast majority of recursive locks are deployed retroac-
     tively when ill-defined lock hierarchies are discovered. As a conse-
     quence, the adoption of recursive locks often mutates obvious bugs into
     obscure ones. This study also revealed an insight: if reentrancy is
     unavoidable, then reader/writer locks are preferable to recursive locks.
     Disciplined use of reader/writer locks enable reentrancy only when reen-
     trancy is safe (the "read" side of the lock).

     Nevertheless, if it is absolutely necessary, what follows is an imperfect
     way of implementing recursive locks using the dispatch framework:

     void
     sloppy_lock(object_t object, void (^block)(void))
     {
	     if (object->owner == pthread_self()) {
		     return block();
	     }
	     dispatch_sync(object->queue, ^{
		     object->owner = pthread_self();
		     block();
		     object->owner = NULL;
	     });
     }

     The above example does not solve the case where queue A runs on thread X
     which calls dispatch_sync() against queue B which runs on thread Y which
     recursively calls dispatch_sync() against queue A, which deadlocks both
     examples. This is bug-for-bug compatible with nontrivial pthread usage.
     In fact, nontrivial reentrancy is impossible to support in recursive
     locks once the ultimate level of reentrancy is deployed (IPC or RPC).

IMPLIED REFERENCES
     Synchronous functions within the dispatch framework hold an implied ref-
     erence on the target queue. In other words, the synchronous function bor-
     rows the reference of the calling function (this is valid because the
     calling function is blocked waiting for the result of the synchronous
     function, and therefore cannot modify the reference count of the target
     queue until after the synchronous function has returned).	For example:

     queue = dispatch_queue_create("com.example.queue", NULL);
     assert(queue);
     dispatch_sync(queue, ^{
	     do_something();
	     //dispatch_release(queue); // NOT SAFE -- dispatch_sync() is still using 'queue'
     });
     dispatch_release(queue); // SAFELY balanced outside of the block provided to dispatch_sync()

     This is in contrast to asynchronous functions which must retain both the
     block and target queue for the duration of the asynchronous operation (as
     the calling function may immediately release its interest in these
     objects).

FUNDAMENTALS
     Conceptually, dispatch_sync() is a convenient wrapper around
     dispatch_async() with the addition of a semaphore to wait for completion
     of the block, and a wrapper around the block to signal its completion.
     See dispatch_semaphore_create(3) for more information about dispatch sem-
     aphores. The actual implementation of the dispatch_sync() function may be
     optimized and differ from the above description.

     The dispatch_async() function is a wrapper around dispatch_async_f().
     The application-defined context parameter is passed to the function when
     it is invoked on the target queue.

     The dispatch_sync() function is a wrapper around dispatch_sync_f().  The
     application-defined context parameter is passed to the function when it
     is invoked on the target queue.
