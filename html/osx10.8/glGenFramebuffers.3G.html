NAME
       glGenFramebuffers - generate framebuffer object names

C SPECIFICATION
       void glGenFramebuffers(GLsizei n, GLuint *ids);

PARAMETERS
       n
	   Specifies the number of framebuffer object names to generate.

       ids
	   Specifies an array in which the generated framebuffer object names
	   are stored.

DESCRIPTION
       glGenFramebuffers returns n framebuffer object names in ids. There is
       no guarantee that the names form a contiguous set of integers; however,
       it is guaranteed that none of the returned names was in use immediately
       before the call to glGenFramebuffers.

       Framebuffer object names returned by a call to glGenFramebuffers are
       not returned by subsequent calls, unless they are first deleted with
       glDeleteFramebuffers().

       The names returned in ids are marked as used, for the purposes of
       glGenFramebuffers only, but they acquire state and type only when they
       are first bound.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if n is negative.

SEE ALSO
       glBindFramebuffer(), glDeleteFramebuffers()
