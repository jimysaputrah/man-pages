NAME
       glutInitWindowPositionWindowPosition, glutInitWindowSize - set the ini-
       tial window position and size respectively.

SYNTAX
       #include &ltGLUT/glut.h&gt

       void glutInitWindowSize(int width, int height);
       void glutInitWindowPosition(int x, int y);

ARGUMENTS
       width	 Width in pixels.

       height	 Height in pixels.

       x	 Window X location in pixels.

       y	 Window Y location in pixels.

DESCRIPTION
       Windows created by glutCreateWindow will be  requested  to  be  created
       with the current initial window position and size.

       The  initial  value of the initial window position GLUT state is -1 and
       -1.  If either the X or Y component to the initial window  position  is
       negative,  the  actual  window position is left to the window system to
       determine.  The initial value of the initial window size GLUT state  is
       300  by	300.   The initial window size components must be greater than
       zero.

       The intent of the initial window position and size values is to provide
       a suggestion to the window system for a window's initial size and posi-
       tion. The window system is  not	obligated  to  use  this  information.
       Therefore,  GLUT  programs  should not assume the window was created at
       the specified size or position. A GLUT program should use the  window's
       reshape callback to determine the true size of the window.

EXAMPLE
       If  you	would like your GLUT program to default to starting at a given
       screen location and at a given size, but you would also like to let the
       user  override  these  defaults	via  a	command line argument (such as
       -geometry for X11), call glutInitWindowSize and	glutInitWindowPosition
       before your call to glutInit.  For example:

	 int main(int argc, char **argv)
	 {
	   glutInitWindowSize(500, 300);
	   glutInitWindowPosition(100, 100);
	   glutInit(&argc, argv);
	   ...
	 }

       However,  if  you'd  like  to force your program to start up at a given
       size, call glutInitWindowSize  and  glutInitWindowPosition  after  your
       call to glutInit.  For example:

	 int main(int argc, char **argv)
	 {
	   glutInit(&argc, argv);
	   glutInitWindowSize(500, 300);
	   glutInitWindowPosition(100, 100);
	   ...
	 }
