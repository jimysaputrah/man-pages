AU_IO(3)		 BSD Library Functions Manual		      AU_IO(3)

NAME
     au_fetch_tok, au_print_tok, au_print_flags_tok, au_read_rec -- perform
     I/O involving an audit record

LIBRARY
     Basic Security Module Library (libbsm, -lbsm)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <bsm/libbsm.h>

     int
     au_fetch_tok(tokenstr_t *tok, u_char *buf, int len);

     void
     au_print_tok(FILE *outfp, tokenstr_t *tok, char *del, char raw,
	 char sfrm);

     void
     au_print_flags_tok(FILE *outfp, tokenstr_t *tok, char *del, int oflags);

     int
     au_read_rec(FILE *fp, u_char **buf);

DESCRIPTION
     These interfaces support input and output (I/O) involving audit records,
     internalizing an audit record from a byte stream, converting a token to
     either a raw or default string, and reading a single record from a file.

     The au_fetch_tok() function reads a token from the passed buffer buf of
     length len bytes, and returns a pointer to the token via tok.

     The au_print_tok() function prints a string form of the token tok to the
     file output stream outfp, either in default mode, or raw mode if raw is
     set non-zero.  The delimiter del is used when printing.  The
     au_print_flags_tok() function is a replacement for au_print_tok().  The
     oflags controls how the output should be formatted and is specified by
     or'ing the following flags:

	   AU_OFLAG_NONE       Use the default form.
	   AU_OFLAG_NORESOLVE  Leave user and group IDs in their numeric form.
	   AU_OFLAG_RAW        Use the raw, numeric form.
	   AU_OFLAG_SHORT      Use the short form.
	   AU_OFLAG_XML        Use the XML form.

     The flags options AU_OFLAG_SHORT and AU_OFLAG_RAW are exclusive and
     should not be used together.

     The au_read_rec() function reads an audit record from the file stream fp,
     and returns an allocated memory buffer containing the record via *buf,
     which must be freed by the caller using free(3).

     A typical use of these routines might open a file with fopen(3), then
     read records from the file sequentially by calling au_read_rec().	Each
     record would be broken down into components tokens through sequential
     calls to au_fetch_tok() on the buffer, and then invoking
     au_print_flags_tok() to print each token to an output stream such as
     stdout.  On completion of the processing of each record, a call to
     free(3) would be used to free the record buffer.  Finally, the source
     stream would be closed by a call to fclose(3).

RETURN VALUES
     The au_fetch_tok() and au_read_rec() functions return 0 on success, or -1
     on failure along with additional error information returned via errno.

HISTORY
     The OpenBSM implementation was created by McAfee Research, the security
     division of McAfee Inc., under contract to Apple Computer, Inc., in 2004.
     It was subsequently adopted by the TrustedBSD Project as the foundation
     for the OpenBSM distribution.

     The au_print_flags_tok() function was added by Stacey Son as a replace-
     ment for the au_print_tok() so new output formatting flags can be easily
     added without changing the API.  The au_print_tok() is obsolete but
     remains in the API to support legacy code.

AUTHORS
     This software was created by Robert Watson, Wayne Salamon, and Suresh
     Krishnaswamy for McAfee Research, the security research division of
     McAfee, Inc., under contract to Apple Computer, Inc.

     The Basic Security Module (BSM) interface to audit records and audit
     event stream format were defined by Sun Microsystems.

BUGS
     The errno variable may not always be properly set in the event of an
     error.
