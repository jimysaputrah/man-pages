NAME
       Moose::Cookbook::Roles::Recipe3 - Applying a role to an object instance

SYNOPSIS
	 package MyApp::Role::Job::Manager;

	 use List::Util qw( first );

	 use Moose::Role;

	 has 'employees' =&gt (
	     is  =&gt 'rw',
	     isa =&gt 'ArrayRef[Employee]',
	 );

	 sub assign_work {
	     my $self = shift;
	     my $work = shift;

	     my $employee = first { !$_-&gthas_work } @{ $self-&gtemployees };

	     die 'All my employees have work to do!' unless $employee;

	     $employee-&gtwork($work);
	 }

	 package main;

	 my $lisa = Employee-&gtnew( name =&gt 'Lisa' );
	 MyApp::Role::Job::Manager-&gtmeta-&gtapply($lisa);

	 my $homer = Employee-&gtnew( name =&gt 'Homer' );
	 my $bart  = Employee-&gtnew( name =&gt 'Bart' );
	 my $marge = Employee-&gtnew( name =&gt 'Marge' );

	 $lisa-&gtemployees( [ $homer, $bart, $marge ] );
	 $lisa-&gtassign_work('mow the lawn');

DESCRIPTION
       In this recipe, we show how a role can be applied to an object. In this
       specific case, we are giving an employee managerial responsibilities.

       Applying a role to an object is simple. The Moose::Meta::Role object
       provides an "apply" method. This method will do the right thing when
       given an object instance.

	 MyApp::Role::Job::Manager-&gtmeta-&gtapply($lisa);

       We could also use the "apply_all_roles" function from Moose::Util.

	 apply_all_roles( $person, MyApp::Role::Job::Manager-&gtmeta );

       The main advantage of using "apply_all_roles" is that it can be used to
       apply more than one role at a time.

       We could also pass parameters to the role we're applying:

	 MyApp::Role::Job::Manager-&gtmeta-&gtapply(
	     $lisa,
	     -alias =&gt { assign_work =&gt 'get_off_your_lazy_behind' },
	 );

       We saw examples of how method exclusion and alias working in roles
       recipe 2.

CONCLUSION
       Applying a role to an object instance is a useful tool for adding
       behavior to existing objects. In our example, it is effective used to
       model a promotion.

       It can also be useful as a sort of controlled monkey-patching for
       existing code, particularly non-Moose code. For example, you could
       create a debugging role and apply it to an object at runtime.
