NAME
       glBindFragDataLocationIndexed - bind a user-defined varying out
       variable to a fragment shader color number and index

C SPECIFICATION
       void glBindFragDataLocationIndexed(GLuint program, GLuint colorNumber,
					  GLuint index, const char *name);

PARAMETERS
       program
	   The name of the program containing varying out variable whose
	   binding to modify

       colorNumber
	   The color number to bind the user-defined varying out variable to

       index
	   The index of the color input to bind the user-defined varying out
	   variable to

       name
	   The name of the user-defined varying out variable whose binding to
	   modify

DESCRIPTION
       glBindFragDataLocationIndexed specifies that the varying out variable
       name in program should be bound to fragment color colorNumber when the
       program is next linked.	index may be zero or one to specify that the
       color be used as either the first or second color input to the blend
       equation, respectively.

       The bindings specified by glBindFragDataLocationIndexed have no effect
       until program is next linked. Bindings may be specified at any time
       after program has been created. Specifically, they may be specified
       before shader objects are attached to the program. Therefore, any name
       may be specified in name, including a name that is never used as a
       varying out variable in any fragment shader object. Names beginning
       with gl_ are reserved by the GL.

       If name was bound previously, its assigned binding is replaced with
       colorNumber and index.  name must be a null-terminated string.  index
       must be less than or equal to one, and colorNumber must be less than
       the value of GL_MAX_DRAW_BUFFERS if index is zero, and less than the
       value of GL_MAX_DUAL_SOURCE_DRAW_BUFFERS if index is greater than or
       equal to one.

       In addition to the errors generated by glBindFragDataLocationIndexed,
       the program program will fail to link if:

       o   The number of active outputs is greater than the value
	   GL_MAX_DRAW_BUFFERS.

       o   More than one varying out variable is bound to the same color
	   number.


NOTES
       Varying out varyings may have locations assigned explicitly in the
       shader text using a location layout qualifier. If a shader statically
       assigns a location to a varying out variable in the shader text, that
       location is used and any location assigned with glBindFragDataLocation
       is ignored.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if colorNumber is greater than or equal
       to GL_MAX_DRAW_BUFFERS.


       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if colorNumber is greater than or equal
       to GL_MAX_DUAL_SOURCE_DRAW_BUFERS and index is greater than or equal to
       one.


       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if index is greater than one.


       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if name starts with the reserved gl_
       prefix.


       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if program is not the name of a
       program object.

ASSOCIATED GETS
       glGetFragDataLocation() with a valid program object and the the name of
       a user-defined varying out variable


       glGetFragDataIndex() with a valid program object and the the name of a
       user-defined varying out variable
