NAME
       MooseX::Getopt - A Moose role for processing command line options

SYNOPSIS
	 ## In your class
	 package My::App;
	 use Moose;

	 with 'MooseX::Getopt';

	 has 'out' =&gt (is =&gt 'rw', isa =&gt 'Str', required =&gt 1);
	 has 'in'  =&gt (is =&gt 'rw', isa =&gt 'Str', required =&gt 1);

	 # ... rest of the class here

	 ## in your script
	 #!/usr/bin/perl

	 use My::App;

	 my $app = My::App-&gtnew_with_options();
	 # ... rest of the script here

	 ## on the command line
	 % perl my_app_script.pl -in file.input -out file.dump

DESCRIPTION
       This is a role which provides an alternate constructor for creating
       objects using parameters passed in from the command line.

       This module attempts to DWIM as much as possible with the command line
       params by introspecting your class's attributes. It will use the name
       of your attribute as the command line option, and if there is a type
       constraint defined, it will configure Getopt::Long to handle the option
       accordingly.

       You can use the trait MooseX::Getopt::Meta::Attribute::Trait or the
       attribute metaclass MooseX::Getopt::Meta::Attribute to get non-default
       commandline option names and aliases.

       You can use the trait MooseX::Getopt::Meta::Attribute::Trait::NoGetopt
       or the attribute metaclass MooseX::Getopt::Meta::Attribute::NoGetopt to
       have "MooseX::Getopt" ignore your attribute in the commandline options.

       By default, attributes which start with an underscore are not given
       commandline argument support, unless the attribute's metaclass is set
       to MooseX::Getopt::Meta::Attribute. If you don't want your accessors to
       have the leading underscore in their name, you can do this:

	 # for read/write attributes
	 has '_foo' =&gt (accessor =&gt 'foo', ...);

	 # or for read-only attributes
	 has '_bar' =&gt (reader =&gt 'bar', ...);

       This will mean that Getopt will not handle a --foo param, but your code
       can still call the "foo" method.

       If your class also uses a configfile-loading role based on
       MooseX::ConfigFromFile, such as MooseX::SimpleConfig, MooseX::Getopt's
       "new_with_options" will load the configfile specified by the
       "--configfile" option (or the default you've given for the configfile
       attribute) for you.

       Options specified in multiple places follow the following precendence
       order: commandline overrides configfile, which overrides explicit
       new_with_options parameters.

   Supported Type Constraints
       Bool
	   A Bool type constraint is set up as a boolean option with
	   Getopt::Long. So that this attribute description:

	     has 'verbose' =&gt (is =&gt 'rw', isa =&gt 'Bool');

	   would translate into "verbose!" as a Getopt::Long option
	   descriptor, which would enable the following command line options:

	     % my_script.pl --verbose
	     % my_script.pl --noverbose

       Int, Float, Str
	   These type constraints are set up as properly typed options with
	   Getopt::Long, using the "=i", "=f" and "=s" modifiers as
	   appropriate.

       ArrayRef
	   An ArrayRef type constraint is set up as a multiple value option in
	   Getopt::Long. So that this attribute description:

	     has 'include' =&gt (
		 is	 =&gt 'rw',
		 isa	 =&gt 'ArrayRef',
		 default =&gt sub { [] }
	     );

	   would translate into "includes=s@" as a Getopt::Long option
	   descriptor, which would enable the following command line options:

	     % my_script.pl --include /usr/lib --include /usr/local/lib

       HashRef
	   A HashRef type constraint is set up as a hash value option in
	   Getopt::Long. So that this attribute description:

	     has 'define' =&gt (
		 is	 =&gt 'rw',
		 isa	 =&gt 'HashRef',
		 default =&gt sub { {} }
	     );

	   would translate into "define=s%" as a Getopt::Long option
	   descriptor, which would enable the following command line options:

	     % my_script.pl --define os=linux --define vendor=debian

   Custom Type Constraints
       It is possible to create custom type constraint to option spec mappings
       if you need them. The process is fairly simple (but a little verbose
       maybe). First you create a custom subtype, like so:

	 subtype 'ArrayOfInts'
	     =&gt as 'ArrayRef'
	     =&gt where { scalar (grep { looks_like_number($_) } @$_)  };

       Then you register the mapping, like so:

	 MooseX::Getopt::OptionTypeMap-&gtadd_option_type_to_map(
	     'ArrayOfInts' =&gt '=i@'
	 );

       Now any attribute declarations using this type constraint will get the
       custom option spec. So that, this:

	 has 'nums' =&gt (
	     is      =&gt 'ro',
	     isa     =&gt 'ArrayOfInts',
	     default =&gt sub { [0] }
	 );

       Will translate to the following on the command line:

	 % my_script.pl --nums 5 --nums 88 --nums 199

       This example is fairly trivial, but more complex validations are easily
       possible with a little creativity. The trick is balancing the type
       constraint validations with the Getopt::Long validations.

       Better examples are certainly welcome :)

   Inferred Type Constraints
       If you define a custom subtype which is a subtype of one of the
       standard "Supported Type Constraints" above, and do not explicitly
       provide custom support as in "Custom Type Constraints" above,
       MooseX::Getopt will treat it like the parent type for Getopt purposes.

       For example, if you had the same custom "ArrayOfInts" subtype from the
       examples above, but did not add a new custom option type for it to the
       "OptionTypeMap", it would be treated just like a normal "ArrayRef" type
       for Getopt purposes (that is, "=s@").

METHODS
   new_with_options (%params)
       This method will take a set of default %params and then collect params
       from the command line (possibly overriding those in %params) and then
       return a newly constructed object.

       The special parameter "argv", if specified should point to an array
       reference with an array to use instead of @ARGV.

       If "GetOptions" in Getopt::Long fails (due to invalid arguments),
       "new_with_options" will throw an exception.

       If Getopt::Long::Descriptive is installed and any of the following
       command line params are passed, the program will exit with usage
       information (and the option's state will be stored in the help_flag
       attribute). You can add descriptions for each option by including a
       documentation option for each attribute to document.

	 --?
	 --help
	 --usage

       If you have Getopt::Long::Descriptive the "usage" param is also passed
       to "new" as the usage option.

   ARGV
       This accessor contains a reference to a copy of the @ARGV array as it
       originally existed at the time of "new_with_options".

   extra_argv
       This accessor contains an arrayref of leftover @ARGV elements that
       Getopt::Long did not parse.  Note that the real @ARGV is left un-
       mangled.

   usage
       This accessor contains the Getopt::Long::Descriptive::Usage object (if
       Getopt::Long::Descriptive is used).

   help_flag
       This accessor contains the boolean state of the --help, --usage and --?
       options (true if any of these options were passed on the command line).

   meta
       This returns the role meta object.

   process_argv (%params)
       This does most of the work of "new_with_options", analyzing the
       parameters and argv, except for actually calling the constructor. It
       returns a MooseX::Getopt::ProcessedArgv object. "new_with_options" uses
       this method internally, so modifying this method via subclasses/roles
       will affect "new_with_options".
