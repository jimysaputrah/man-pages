PREPARE TRANSACTION(7)	PostgreSQL 9.1.4 Documentation	PREPARE TRANSACTION(7)



NAME
       PREPARE_TRANSACTION - prepare the current transaction for two-phase
       commit

SYNOPSIS
       PREPARE TRANSACTION transaction_id

DESCRIPTION
       PREPARE TRANSACTION prepares the current transaction for two-phase
       commit. After this command, the transaction is no longer associated
       with the current session; instead, its state is fully stored on disk,
       and there is a very high probability that it can be committed
       successfully, even if a database crash occurs before the commit is
       requested.

       Once prepared, a transaction can later be committed or rolled back with
       COMMIT PREPARED (COMMIT_PREPARED(7)) or ROLLBACK PREPARED
       (ROLLBACK_PREPARED(7)), respectively. Those commands can be issued from
       any session, not only the one that executed the original transaction.

       From the point of view of the issuing session, PREPARE TRANSACTION is
       not unlike a ROLLBACK command: after executing it, there is no active
       current transaction, and the effects of the prepared transaction are no
       longer visible. (The effects will become visible again if the
       transaction is committed.)

       If the PREPARE TRANSACTION command fails for any reason, it becomes a
       ROLLBACK: the current transaction is canceled.

PARAMETERS
       transaction_id
	   An arbitrary identifier that later identifies this transaction for
	   COMMIT PREPARED or ROLLBACK PREPARED. The identifier must be
	   written as a string literal, and must be less than 200 bytes long.
	   It must not be the same as the identifier used for any currently
	   prepared transaction.

NOTES
       PREPARE TRANSACTION is not intended for use in applications or
       interactive sessions. Its purpose is to allow an external transaction
       manager to perform atomic global transactions across multiple databases
       or other transactional resources. Unless you're writing a transaction
       manager, you probably shouldn't be using PREPARE TRANSACTION.

       This command must be used inside a transaction block. Use BEGIN(7) to
       start one.

       It is not currently allowed to PREPARE a transaction that has executed
       any operations involving temporary tables, created any cursors WITH
       HOLD, or executed LISTEN or UNLISTEN. Those features are too tightly
       tied to the current session to be useful in a transaction to be
       prepared.

       If the transaction modified any run-time parameters with SET (without
       the LOCAL option), those effects persist after PREPARE TRANSACTION, and
       will not be affected by any later COMMIT PREPARED or ROLLBACK PREPARED.
       Thus, in this one respect PREPARE TRANSACTION acts more like COMMIT
       than ROLLBACK.

       All currently available prepared transactions are listed in the
       pg_prepared_xacts system view.

	   Caution
	   It is unwise to leave transactions in the prepared state for a long
	   time. This will interfere with the ability of VACUUM to reclaim
	   storage, and in extreme cases could cause the database to shut down
	   to prevent transaction ID wraparound (see Section 23.1.4,
	   "Preventing Transaction ID Wraparound Failures", in the
	   documentation). Keep in mind also that the transaction continues to
	   hold whatever locks it held. The intended usage of the feature is
	   that a prepared transaction will normally be committed or rolled
	   back as soon as an external transaction manager has verified that
	   other databases are also prepared to commit.

	   If you have not set up an external transaction manager to track
	   prepared transactions and ensure they get closed out promptly, it
	   is best to keep the prepared-transaction feature disabled by
	   setting max_prepared_transactions to zero. This will prevent
	   accidental creation of prepared transactions that might then be
	   forgotten and eventually cause problems.

EXAMPLES
       Prepare the current transaction for two-phase commit, using foobar as
       the transaction identifier:

	   PREPARE TRANSACTION 'foobar';
