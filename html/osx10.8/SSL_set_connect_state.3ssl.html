SSL_set_connect_state(3)	    OpenSSL	      SSL_set_connect_state(3)



NAME
       SSL_set_connect_state, SSL_get_accept_state - prepare SSL object to
       work in client or server mode

SYNOPSIS
	#include &ltopenssl/ssl.h&gt

	void SSL_set_connect_state(SSL *ssl);

	void SSL_set_accept_state(SSL *ssl);

DESCRIPTION
       SSL_set_connect_state() sets ssl to work in client mode.

       SSL_set_accept_state() sets ssl to work in server mode.

NOTES
       When the SSL_CTX object was created with SSL_CTX_new(3), it was either
       assigned a dedicated client method, a dedicated server method, or a
       generic method, that can be used for both client and server
       connections. (The method might have been changed with
       SSL_CTX_set_ssl_version(3) or SSL_set_ssl_method().)

       When beginning a new handshake, the SSL engine must know whether it
       must call the connect (client) or accept (server) routines. Even though
       it may be clear from the method chosen, whether client or server mode
       was requested, the handshake routines must be explicitly set.

       When using the SSL_connect(3) or SSL_accept(3) routines, the correct
       handshake routines are automatically set. When performing a transparent
       negotiation using SSL_write(3) or SSL_read(3), the handshake routines
       must be explicitly set in advance using either SSL_set_connect_state()
       or SSL_set_accept_state().

RETURN VALUES
       SSL_set_connect_state() and SSL_set_accept_state() do not return
       diagnostic information.
