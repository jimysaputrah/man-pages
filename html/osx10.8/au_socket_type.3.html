AU_BSM_TO_SOCKET_TYPE(3) BSD Library Functions Manual AU_BSM_TO_SOCKET_TYPE(3)

NAME
     au_bsm_to_socket_type, au_socket_type_to_bsm -- convert between BSM and
     local socket types

LIBRARY
     Basic Security Module Library (libbsm, -lbsm)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <bsm/libbsm.h>

     int
     au_bsm_to_socket_type(u_short bsm_socket_type, int *local_socket_typep);

     u_short
     au_socket_type_to_bsm(int local_socket_type);

DESCRIPTION
     These interfaces may be used to convert between the local and BSM socket
     types.  The au_bsm_to_socket_type() function accepts a BSM socket type,
     bsm_socket_type, and converts it to a local socket type, such as those
     passed to socket(2), that will be stored in the integer pointed to by
     local_socket_typep if successful.	This call will fail if the BSM socket
     type cannot be mapped into a local socket type, which may occur if the
     socket token was generated on another operating system.

     au_socket_type_to_bsm() function accepts a local socket type, and returns
     the BSM socket type for it.  This call cannot fail, and instead returns a
     BSM socket type indicating to a later decoder that the socket type could
     not be encoded.

RETURN VALULES
     On success, au_bsm_to_socket_type() returns 0 and a converted socket
     type; on failure, it returns -1 but does not set errno(2).

     On success, au_strerror() returns a pointer to an error string; on fail-
     ure it will return NULL.

HISTORY
     au_bsm_to_socket_type() and au_socket_type_to_bsm() were introduced in
     OpenBSM 1.1.

AUTHORS
     These functions were implemented by Robert Watson under contract to Apple
     Inc.

     The Basic Security Module (BSM) interface to audit records and audit
     event stream format were defined by Sun Microsystems.
