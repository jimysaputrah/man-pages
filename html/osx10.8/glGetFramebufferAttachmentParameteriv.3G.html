GLGETFRAMEBUFFERATTA(3G)	  OpenGL 3.3	      GLGETFRAMEBUFFERATTA(3G)



NAME
       glGetFramebufferAttachmentParameteriv - retrieve information about
       attachments of a bound framebuffer object

C SPECIFICATION
       void glGetFramebufferAttachmentParameter(GLenum target,
						GLenum attachment,
						GLenum pname, GLint *params);

PARAMETERS
       target
	   Specifies the target of the query operation.

       attachment
	   Specifies the attachment within target

       pname
	   Specifies the parameter of attachment to query.

       params
	   Specifies the address of a variable receive the value of pname for
	   attachment.

DESCRIPTION
       glGetFramebufferAttachmentParameter returns information about
       attachments of a bound framebuffer object.  target specifies the
       framebuffer binding point and must be GL_DRAW_FRAMEBUFFER,
       GL_READ_FRAMEBUFFER or GL_FRAMEBUFFER.  GL_FRAMEBUFFER is equivalent to
       GL_DRAW_FRAMEBUFFER.

       If the default framebuffer is bound to target then attachment must be
       one of GL_FRONT_LEFT, GL_FRONT_RIGHT, GL_BACK_LEFT, or GL_BACK_RIGHT,
       identifying a color buffer, GL_DEPTH, identifying the depth buffer, or
       GL_STENCIL, identifying the stencil buffer.

       If a framebuffer object is bound, then attachment must be one of
       GL_COLOR_ATTACHMENTi, GL_DEPTH_ATTACHMENT, GL_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT, or
       GL_DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT.  i in GL_COLOR_ATTACHMENTi must be in the
       range zero to the value of GL_MAX_COLOR_ATTACHMENTS - 1.

       If attachment is GL_DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT and different objects are
       bound to the depth and stencil attachment points of target the query
       will fail. If the same object is bound to both attachment points,
       information about that object will be returned.

       Upon successful return from glGetFramebufferAttachmentParameteriv, if
       pname is GL_FRAMEBUFFER_ATTACHMENT_OBJECT_TYPE, then params will
       contain one of GL_NONE, GL_FRAMEBUFFER_DEFAULT, GL_TEXTURE, or
       GL_RENDERBUFFER, identifying the type of object which contains the
       attached image. Other values accepted for pname depend on the type of
       object, as described below.

       If the value of GL_FRAMEBUFFER_ATTACHMENT_OBJECT_TYPE is GL_NONE, no
       framebuffer is bound to target. In this case querying pname
       GL_FRAMEBUFFER_ATTACHMENT_OBJECT_NAME will return zero, and all other
       queries will generate an error.

       If the value of GL_FRAMEBUFFER_ATTACHMENT_OBJECT_TYPE is not GL_NONE,
       these queries apply to all other framebuffer types:

       o   If pname is GL_FRAMEBUFFER_ATTACHMENT_RED_SIZE,
	   GL_FRAMEBUFFER_ATTACHMENT_GREEN_SIZE,
	   GL_FRAMEBUFFER_ATTACHMENT_BLUE_SIZE,
	   GL_FRAMEBUFFER_ATTACHMENT_ALPHA_SIZE,
	   GL_FRAMEBUFFER_ATTACHMENT_DEPTH_SIZE, or
	   GL_FRAMEBUFFER_ATTACHMENT_STENCIL_SIZE, then params will contain
	   the number of bits in the corresponding red, green, blue, alpha,
	   depth, or stencil component of the specified attachment. Zero is
	   returned if the requested component is not present in attachment.

       o   If pname is GL_FRAMEBUFFER_ATTACHMENT_COMPONENT_TYPE, params will
	   contain the format of components of the specified attachment, one
	   of GL_FLOAT, GL_INT, GL_UNSIGNED_INT, GL_SIGNED_NORMALIZED, or
	   GL_UNSIGNED_NORMALIZED for floating-point, signed integer, unsigned
	   integer, signed normalized fixed-point, or unsigned normalized
	   fixed-point components respectively. Only color buffers may have
	   integer components.

       o   If pname is GL_FRAMEBUFFER_ATTACHMENT_COLOR_ENCODING, param will
	   contain the encoding of components of the specified attachment, one
	   of GL_LINEAR or GL_SRGB for linear or sRGB-encoded components,
	   respectively. Only color buffer components may be sRGB-encoded;
	   such components are treated as described in sections 4.1.7 and
	   4.1.8. For the default framebuffer, color encoding is determined by
	   the implementation. For framebuffer objects, components are
	   sRGB-encoded if the internal format of a color attachment is one of
	   the color-renderable SRGB formats.

       If the value of GL_FRAMEBUFFER_ATTACHMENT_OBJECT_TYPE is
       GL_RENDERBUFFER, then:

       o   If pname is GL_FRAMEBUFFER_ATTACHMENT_OBJECT_NAME, params will
	   contain the name of the renderbuffer object which contains the
	   attached image.

       If the value of GL_FRAMEBUFFER_ATTACHMENT_OBJECT_TYPE is GL_TEXTURE,
       then:

       o   If pname is GL_FRAMEBUFFER_ATTACHMENT_OBJECT_NAME, then params will
	   contain the name of the texture object which contains the attached
	   image.

       o   If pname is GL_FRAMEBUFFER_ATTACHMENT_TEXTURE_LEVEL, then params
	   will contain the mipmap level of the texture object which contains
	   the attached image.

       o   If pname is GL_FRAMEBUFFER_ATTACHMENT_TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP_FACE and the
	   texture object named GL_FRAMEBUFFER_ATTACHMENT_OBJECT_NAME is a
	   cube map texture, then params will contain the cube map face of the
	   cubemap texture object which contains the attached image. Otherwise
	   params will contain the value zero.

       o   If pname is GL_FRAMEBUFFER_ATTACHMENT_TEXTURE_LAYER and the texture
	   object named GL_FRAMEBUFFER_ATTACHMENT_OBJECT_NAME is a layer of a
	   three-dimensional texture or a one-or two-dimensional array
	   texture, then params will contain the number of the texture layer
	   which contains the attached image. Otherwise params will contain
	   the value zero.

       o   If pname is GL_FRAMEBUFFER_ATTACHMENT_LAYERED, then params will
	   contain GL_TRUE if an entire level of a three-dimesional texture,
	   cube map texture, or one-or two-dimensional array texture is
	   attached. Otherwise, params will contain GL_FALSE.

       Any combinations of framebuffer type and pname not described above will
       generate an error.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if target is not one of the accepted
       tokens.


       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if pname is not valid for the value of
       GL_FRAMEBUFFER_ATTACHMENT_OBJECT_TYPE.


       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if attachment is not the accepted
       values for target.


       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if attachment is
       GL_DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT and different objects are bound to the
       depth and stencil attachment points of target.


       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if the value of
       GL_FRAMEBUFFER_ATTACHMENT_OBJECT_TYPE is GL_NONE and pname is not
       GL_FRAMEBUFFER_ATTACHMENT_OBJECT_NAME.
