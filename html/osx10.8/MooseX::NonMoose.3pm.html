NAME
       MooseX::NonMoose - easy subclassing of non-Moose classes

VERSION
       version 0.22

SYNOPSIS
	 package Term::VT102::NBased;
	 use Moose;
	 use MooseX::NonMoose;
	 extends 'Term::VT102';

	 has [qw/x_base y_base/] =&gt (
	     is      =&gt 'ro',
	     isa     =&gt 'Int',
	     default =&gt 1,
	 );

	 around x =&gt sub {
	     my $orig = shift;
	     my $self = shift;
	     $self-&gt$orig(@_) + $self-&gtx_base - 1;
	 };

	 # ... (wrap other methods)

	 no Moose;
	 # no need to fiddle with inline_constructor here
	 __PACKAGE__-&gtmeta-&gtmake_immutable;

	 my $vt = Term::VT102::NBased-&gtnew(x_base =&gt 0, y_base =&gt 0);

DESCRIPTION
       "MooseX::NonMoose" allows for easily subclassing non-Moose classes with
       Moose, taking care of the annoying details connected with doing this,
       such as setting up proper inheritance from Moose::Object and installing
       (and inlining, at "make_immutable" time) a constructor that makes sure
       things like "BUILD" methods are called. It tries to be as non-intrusive
       as possible - when this module is used, inheriting from non-Moose
       classes and inheriting from Moose classes should work identically,
       aside from the few caveats mentioned below.  One of the goals of this
       module is that including it in a Moose::Exporter-based package used
       across an entire application should be possible, without interfering
       with classes that only inherit from Moose modules, or even classes that
       don't inherit from anything at all.

       There are several ways to use this module. The most straightforward is
       to just "use MooseX::NonMoose;" in your class; this should set up
       everything necessary for extending non-Moose modules.
       MooseX::NonMoose::Meta::Role::Class and
       MooseX::NonMoose::Meta::Role::Constructor can also be applied to your
       metaclasses manually, either by passing a "-traits" option to your "use
       Moose;" line, or by applying them using Moose::Util::MetaRole in a
       Moose::Exporter-based package. MooseX::NonMoose::Meta::Role::Class is
       the part that provides the main functionality of this module; if you
       don't care about inlining, this is all you need to worry about.
       Applying MooseX::NonMoose::Meta::Role::Constructor as well will provide
       an inlined constructor when you immutabilize your class.

       "MooseX::NonMoose" allows you to manipulate the argument list that gets
       passed to the superclass constructor by defining a "FOREIGNBUILDARGS"
       method. This is called with the same argument list as the "BUILDARGS"
       method, but should return a list of arguments to pass to the superclass
       constructor. This allows "MooseX::NonMoose" to support superclasses
       whose constructors would get confused by the extra arguments that Moose
       requires (for attributes, etc.)

       Not all non-Moose classes use "new" as the name of their constructor.
       This module allows you to extend these classes by explicitly stating
       which method is the constructor, during the call to "extends". The
       syntax looks like this:

	 extends 'Foo' =&gt { -constructor_name =&gt 'create' };

       similar to how you can already pass "-version" in the "extends" call in
       a similar way.

BUGS/CAVEATS
       o   The reference that the non-Moose class uses as its instance type
	   must match the instance type that Moose is using. Moose's default
	   instance type is a hashref, but other modules exist to make Moose
	   use other instance types. MooseX::InsideOut is the most general
	   solution - it should work with any class. For globref-based classes
	   in particular, MooseX::GlobRef will also allow Moose to work. For
	   more information, see the "032-moosex-insideout" and
	   "033-moosex-globref" tests bundled with this dist.

       o   Completely overriding the constructor in a class using
	   "MooseX::NonMoose" (i.e. using "sub new { ... }") currently doesn't
	   work, although using method modifiers on the constructor should
	   work identically to normal Moose classes.
