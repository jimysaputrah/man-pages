NAME
       MIME::Words - deal with RFC 2047 encoded words

SYNOPSIS
       Before reading further, you should see MIME::Tools to make sure that
       you understand where this module fits into the grand scheme of things.
       Go on, do it now.  I'll wait.

       Ready?  Ok...

	   use MIME::Words qw(:all);

	   ### Decode the string into another string, forgetting the charsets:
	   $decoded = decode_mimewords(
		 'To: =?ISO-8859-1?Q?Keld_J=F8rn_Simonsen?= &ltkeld@dkuug.dk&gt',
		 );

	   ### Split string into array of decoded [DATA,CHARSET] pairs:
	   @decoded = decode_mimewords(
		 'To: =?ISO-8859-1?Q?Keld_J=F8rn_Simonsen?= &ltkeld@dkuug.dk&gt',
		 );

	   ### Encode a single unsafe word:
	   $encoded = encode_mimeword("\xABFran\xE7ois\xBB");

	   ### Encode a string, trying to find the unsafe words inside it:
	   $encoded = encode_mimewords("Me and \xABFran\xE7ois\xBB in town");

DESCRIPTION
       Fellow Americans, you probably won't know what the hell this module is
       for.  Europeans, Russians, et al, you probably do.  ":-)".

       For example, here's a valid MIME header you might get:

	     From: =?US-ASCII?Q?Keith_Moore?= &ltmoore@cs.utk.edu&gt
	     To: =?ISO-8859-1?Q?Keld_J=F8rn_Simonsen?= &ltkeld@dkuug.dk&gt
	     CC: =?ISO-8859-1?Q?Andr=E9_?= Pirard &ltPIRARD@vm1.ulg.ac.be&gt
	     Subject: =?ISO-8859-1?B?SWYgeW91IGNhbiByZWFkIHRoaXMgeW8=?=
	      =?ISO-8859-2?B?dSB1bmRlcnN0YW5kIHRoZSBleGFtcGxlLg==?=
	      =?US-ASCII?Q?.._cool!?=

       The fields basically decode to (sorry, I can only approximate the Latin
       characters with 7 bit sequences /o and 'e):

	     From: Keith Moore &ltmoore@cs.utk.edu&gt
	     To: Keld J/orn Simonsen &ltkeld@dkuug.dk&gt
	     CC: Andr'e  Pirard &ltPIRARD@vm1.ulg.ac.be&gt
	     Subject: If you can read this you understand the example... cool!

PUBLIC INTERFACE
       decode_mimewords ENCODED, [OPTS...]
	   Function.  Go through the string looking for RFC 2047-style "Q"
	   (quoted-printable, sort of) or "B" (base64) encoding, and decode
	   them.

	   In an array context, splits the ENCODED string into a list of
	   decoded "[DATA, CHARSET]" pairs, and returns that list.  Unencoded
	   data are returned in a 1-element array "[DATA]", giving an
	   effective CHARSET of "undef".

	       $enc = '=?ISO-8859-1?Q?Keld_J=F8rn_Simonsen?= &ltkeld@dkuug.dk&gt';
	       foreach (decode_mimewords($enc)) {
		   print "", ($_[1] || 'US-ASCII'), ": ", $_[0], "\n";
	       }

	   In a scalar context, joins the "data" elements of the above list
	   together, and returns that.	Warning: this is information-lossy,
	   and probably not what you want, but if you know that all charsets
	   in the ENCODED string are identical, it might be useful to you.
	   (Before you use this, please see "unmime" in MIME::WordDecoder,
	   which is probably what you want.)

	   In the event of a syntax error, $@ will be set to a description of
	   the error, but parsing will continue as best as possible (so as to
	   get something back when decoding headers).  $@ will be false if no
	   error was detected.

	   Any arguments past the ENCODED string are taken to define a hash of
	   options:

	   Field
	       Name of the mail field this string came from.  Currently
	       ignored.

       encode_mimeword RAW, [ENCODING], [CHARSET]
	   Function.  Encode a single RAW "word" that has unsafe characters.
	   The "word" will be encoded in its entirety.

	       ### Encode "&lt&ltFranc,ois&gt&gt":
	       $encoded = encode_mimeword("\xABFran\xE7ois\xBB");

	   You may specify the ENCODING ("Q" or "B"), which defaults to "Q".
	   You may specify the CHARSET, which defaults to "iso-8859-1".

       encode_mimewords RAW, [OPTS]
	   Function.  Given a RAW string, try to find and encode all "unsafe"
	   sequences of characters:

	       ### Encode a string with some unsafe "words":
	       $encoded = encode_mimewords("Me and \xABFran\xE7ois\xBB");

	   Returns the encoded string.	Any arguments past the RAW string are
	   taken to define a hash of options:

	   Charset
	       Encode all unsafe stuff with this charset.  Default is
	       'ISO-8859-1', a.k.a. "Latin-1".

	   Encoding
	       The encoding to use, "q" or "b".  The default is "q".

	   Field
	       Name of the mail field this string will be used in.  Currently
	       ignored.

	   Warning: this is a quick-and-dirty solution, intended for character
	   sets which overlap ASCII.  It does not comply with the RFC 2047
	   rules regarding the use of encoded words in message headers.  You
	   may want to roll your own variant, using "encoded_mimeword()", for
	   your application.  Thanks to Jan Kasprzak for reminding me about
	   this problem.

       MIME::Base64 and MIME::QuotedPrint.
