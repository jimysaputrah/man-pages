NAME
       DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::Replicated::Balancer::Random - A 'random'
       Balancer

SYNOPSIS
       This class is used internally by DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::Replicated.
       You shouldn't need to create instances of this class.

DESCRIPTION
       Given a pool (DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::Replicated::Pool) of
       replicated database's
       (DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::Replicated::Replicant), defines a method by
       which query load can be spread out across each replicant in the pool.

       This Balancer uses List::Util keyword 'shuffle' to randomly pick an
       active replicant from the associated pool.  This may or may not be
       random enough for you, patches welcome.

ATTRIBUTES
       This class defines the following attributes.

   master_read_weight
       A number greater than 0 that specifies what weight to give the master
       when choosing which backend to execute a read query on. A value of 0,
       which is the default, does no reads from master, while a value of 1
       gives it the same priority as any single replicant.

       For example: if you have 2 replicants, and a "master_read_weight" of
       0.5, the chance of reading from master will be "20%".

       You can set it to a value higher than 1, making master have higher
       weight than any single replicant, if for example you have a very
       powerful master.

METHODS
       This class defines the following methods.

   next_storage
       Returns an active replicant at random.  Please note that due to the
       nature of the word 'random' this means it's possible for a particular
       active replicant to be requested several times in a row.
