NAME
       git-sh-i18n - Git's i18n setup code for shell scripts

SYNOPSIS
       . "$(git --exec-path)/git-sh-i18n"


DESCRIPTION
       This is not a command the end user would want to run. Ever. This
       documentation is meant for people who are studying the Porcelain-ish
       scripts and/or are writing new ones.

       The 'git sh-i18n scriptlet is designed to be sourced (using .) by Git's
       porcelain programs implemented in shell script. It provides wrappers
       for the GNU gettext and eval_gettext functions accessible through the
       gettext.sh script, and provides pass-through fallbacks on systems
       without GNU gettext.

FUNCTIONS
       gettext
	   Currently a dummy fall-through function implemented as a wrapper
	   around printf(1). Will be replaced by a real gettext implementation
	   in a later version.

       eval_gettext
	   Currently a dummy fall-through function implemented as a wrapper
	   around printf(1) with variables expanded by the git-sh-
	   i18n--envsubst(1) helper. Will be replaced by a real gettext
	   implementation in a later version.

GIT
       Part of the git(1) suite
