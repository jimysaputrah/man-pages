PERL(1) 		  BSD General Commands Manual		       PERL(1)

NAME
     perl, a2p -- Practical Extraction and Report Language

SYNOPSIS
     perl ...
     a2p ...

DESCRIPTION
     To support multiple versions, the program named perl now just selects the
     real version of Perl to run, and the program named a2p now just selects
     the real version of the awk-to-perl translator to run, depending on vari-
     ous settings.  The current supported versions are 5.12 and 5.10, with the
     default being 5.12 (older alternate versions are provided for backward-
     compatibility, while newer alternate versions are provided before we are
     ready to make it the default).  Use

	   % man perl5.12
	   % man perl5.10
	   % man a2p5.12
	   % man a2p5.10

     to see the man page for a specific version.  When the version is unspeci-
     fied, as in:

	   % man perldoc

     the man page for the (unmodified) default version of Perl (5.12) will be
     shown.

CHANGING THE DEFAULT PERL VERSION
     Using

	   % defaults write com.apple.versioner.perl Version 5.10

     will make version 5.10 the user default when running the both the perl
     and a2p commands (versioner is the internal name of the version-selection
     software used).

     To set a system-wide default, replace `com.apple.versioner.perl' with
     `/Library/Preferences/com.apple.versioner.perl' (admin privileges will be
     required).

     The environment variable VERSIONER_PERL_VERSION can also be used to set
     the perl and a2p version:

	   % export VERSIONER_PERL_VERSION=5.10 # Bourne-like shells
		or
	   % setenv VERSIONER_PERL_VERSION 5.10 # C-like shells
	   % perl ...

     This environment variable takes precedence over the setting in any pref-
     erence file.

64-BIT SUPPORT
     Both versions of perl support 64-bit execution (which is the default).
     Like the setting the version of Perl, the perl command can select between
     32 and 64-bit execution.  Use:

	   % defaults write com.apple.versioner.perl Prefer-32-Bit -bool yes

     to make 32-bit execution the user default (using
     `/Library/Preferences/com.apple.versioner.perl' will set the system-wide
     default).	The environment variable VERSIONER_PERL_PREFER_32_BIT can also
     be used (has precedence over the preference file):

	   % export VERSIONER_PERL_PREFER_32_BIT=yes # Bourne-like shells
		or
	   % setenv VERSIONER_PERL_PREFER_32_BIT yes # C-like shells

     Again, the preference setting and environmental variable applies to both
     perl and a2p.

USING A SPECIFIC VERSION
     Rather than using the perl command, one can use a specific version
     directly.	For example, running perl5.10 from the command line will run
     the 5.10 version of Perl, independent of what the default version of Perl
     is.

     One can use a specific version of Perl on the #! line of a script, but
     that may have portability and future compatibility issues.

     Note that the preference files and environment variable that apply to the
     perl command, do not apply when running a specific version of Perl.  In
     particular, running perl5.12 will always default to 64-bit execution
     (unless one uses the arch(1) command to specifically select a 32-bit
     architecture).
