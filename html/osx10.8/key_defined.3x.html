NAME
       key_defined - check if a keycode is defined

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curses.h>

       int key_defined(const char *definition);

DESCRIPTION
       This  is an extension to the curses library.  It permits an application
       to determine if a string is currently bound to any keycode.

RETURN VALUE
       If the string is bound to a keycode, its value (greater than  zero)  is
       returned.   If  no  keycode  is bound, zero is returned.  If the string
       conflicts with longer strings which are bound to keys, -1 is  returned.

PORTABILITY
       These  routines	are  specific  to ncurses.  They were not supported on
       Version 7, BSD or System V implementations.  It is recommended that any
       code depending on them be conditioned using NCURSES_VERSION.

SEE ALSO
       define_key(3X).
