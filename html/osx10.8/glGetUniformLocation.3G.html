GLGETUNIFORMLOCATION(3G)	  OpenGL 3.3	      GLGETUNIFORMLOCATION(3G)



NAME
       glGetUniformLocation - Returns the location of a uniform variable

C SPECIFICATION
       GLint glGetUniformLocation(GLuint program, const GLchar *name);

PARAMETERS
       program
	   Specifies the program object to be queried.

       name
	   Points to a null terminated string containing the name of the
	   uniform variable whose location is to be queried.

DESCRIPTION
       glGetUniformLocation returns an integer that represents the location of
       a specific uniform variable within a program object.  name must be a
       null terminated string that contains no white space.  name must be an
       active uniform variable name in program that is not a structure, an
       array of structures, or a subcomponent of a vector or a matrix. This
       function returns -1 if name does not correspond to an active uniform
       variable in program or if name starts with the reserved prefix "gl_".

       Uniform variables that are structures or arrays of structures may be
       queried by calling glGetUniformLocation for each field within the
       structure. The array element operator "[]" and the structure field
       operator "." may be used in name in order to select elements within an
       array or fields within a structure. The result of using these operators
       is not allowed to be another structure, an array of structures, or a
       subcomponent of a vector or a matrix. Except if the last part of name
       indicates a uniform variable array, the location of the first element
       of an array can be retrieved by using the name of the array, or by
       using the name appended by "[0]".

       The actual locations assigned to uniform variables are not known until
       the program object is linked successfully. After linking has occurred,
       the command glGetUniformLocation can be used to obtain the location of
       a uniform variable. This location value can then be passed to
       glUniform() to set the value of the uniform variable or to
       glGetUniform() in order to query the current value of the uniform
       variable. After a program object has been linked successfully, the
       index values for uniform variables remain fixed until the next link
       command occurs. Uniform variable locations and values can only be
       queried after a link if the link was successful.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if program is not a value generated by
       OpenGL.

       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if program is not a program object.

       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if program has not been successfully
       linked.

ASSOCIATED GETS
       glGetActiveUniform() with arguments program and the index of an active
       uniform variable

       glGetProgram() with arguments program and GL_ACTIVE_UNIFORMS or
       GL_ACTIVE_UNIFORM_MAX_LENGTH

       glGetUniform() with arguments program and the name of a uniform
       variable

       glIsProgram()
