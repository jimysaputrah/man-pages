NAME
       App::Cpan - easily interact with CPAN from the command line

SYNOPSIS
	       # with arguments and no switches, installs specified modules
	       cpan module_name [ module_name ... ]

	       # with switches, installs modules with extra behavior
	       cpan [-cfFimt] module_name [ module_name ... ]

	       # use local::lib
	       cpan -l module_name [ module_name ... ]

	       # with just the dot, install from the distribution in the
	       # current directory
	       cpan .

	       # without arguments, starts CPAN.pm shell
	       cpan

	       # without arguments, but some switches
	       cpan [-ahruvACDLO]

DESCRIPTION
       This script provides a command interface (not a shell) to CPAN. At the
       moment it uses CPAN.pm to do the work, but it is not a one-shot command
       runner for CPAN.pm.

   Options
       -a  Creates a CPAN.pm autobundle with CPAN::Shell->autobundle.

       -A module [ module ... ]
	   Shows the primary maintainers for the specified modules.

       -c module
	   Runs a `make clean` in the specified module's directories.

       -C module [ module ... ]
	   Show the Changes files for the specified modules

       -D module [ module ... ]
	   Show the module details. This prints one line for each out-of-date
	   module (meaning, modules locally installed but have newer versions
	   on CPAN).  Each line has three columns: module name, local version,
	   and CPAN version.

       -f  Force the specified action, when it normally would have failed. Use
	   this to install a module even if its tests fail. When you use this
	   option, -i is not optional for installing a module when you need to
	   force it:

		   % cpan -f -i Module::Foo

       -F  Turn off CPAN.pm's attempts to lock anything. You should be careful
	   with this since you might end up with multiple scripts trying to
	   muck in the same directory. This isn't so much of a concern if
	   you're loading a special config with "-j", and that config sets up
	   its own work directories.

       -g module [ module ... ]
	   Downloads to the current directory the latest distribution of the
	   module.

       -G module [ module ... ]
	   UNIMPLEMENTED

	   Download to the current directory the latest distribution of the
	   modules, unpack each distribution, and create a git repository for
	   each distribution.

	   If you want this feature, check out Yanick Champoux's
	   "Git::CPAN::Patch" distribution.

       -h  Print a help message and exit. When you specify "-h", it ignores
	   all of the other options and arguments.

       -i  Install the specified modules.

       -j Config.pm
	   Load the file that has the CPAN configuration data. This should
	   have the same format as the standard CPAN/Config.pm file, which
	   defines $CPAN::Config as an anonymous hash.

       -J  Dump the configuration in the same format that CPAN.pm uses. This
	   is useful for checking the configuration as well as using the dump
	   as a starting point for a new, custom configuration.

       -l  Use "local::lib".

       -L author [ author ... ]
	   List the modules by the specified authors.

       -m  Make the specified modules.

       -O  Show the out-of-date modules.

       -t  Run a `make test` on the specified modules.

       -r  Recompiles dynamically loaded modules with CPAN::Shell->recompile.

       -u  Upgrade all installed modules. Blindly doing this can really break
	   things, so keep a backup.

       -v  Print the script version and CPAN.pm version then exit.

   Examples
	       # print a help message
	       cpan -h

	       # print the version numbers
	       cpan -v

	       # create an autobundle
	       cpan -a

	       # recompile modules
	       cpan -r

	       # upgrade all installed modules
	       cpan -u

	       # install modules ( sole -i is optional )
	       cpan -i Netscape::Booksmarks Business::ISBN

	       # force install modules ( must use -i )
	       cpan -fi CGI::Minimal URI

   Methods
       run()
	   Just do it.

	   The "run" method returns 0 on success and a postive number on
	   failure. See the section on EXIT CODES for details on the values.

	   CPAN.pm sends all the good stuff either to STDOUT. I have to
	   intercept that output so I can find out what happened.

EXIT VALUES
       The script exits with zero if it thinks that everything worked, or a
       positive number if it thinks that something failed. Note, however, that
       in some cases it has to divine a failure by the output of things it
       does not control. For now, the exit codes are vague:

	       1       An unknown error

	       2       The was an external problem

	       4       There was an internal problem with the script

	       8       A module failed to install

TO DO
       * There is initial support for Log4perl if it is available, but I
       haven't gone through everything to make the NullLogger work out
       correctly if Log4perl is not installed.

       * When I capture CPAN.pm output, I need to check for errors and report
       them to the user.

BUGS
       * none noted

SEE ALSO
       Most behaviour, including environment variables and configuration,
       comes directly from CPAN.pm.

SOURCE AVAILABILITY
       This code is in Github:

CREDITS
       Japheth Cleaver added the bits to allow a forced install (-f).

       Jim Brandt suggest and provided the initial implementation for the up-
       to-date and Changes features.

       Adam Kennedy pointed out that exit() causes problems on Windows where
       this script ends up with a .bat extension
