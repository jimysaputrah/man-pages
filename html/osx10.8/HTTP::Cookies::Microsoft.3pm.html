NAME
       HTTP::Cookies::Microsoft - access to Microsoft cookies files

SYNOPSIS
	use LWP;
	use HTTP::Cookies::Microsoft;
	use Win32::TieRegistry(Delimiter =&gt "/");
	my $cookies_dir = $Registry-&gt
	     {"CUser/Software/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/Explorer/Shell Folders/Cookies"};

	$cookie_jar = HTTP::Cookies::Microsoft-&gtnew(
			  file	   =&gt "$cookies_dir\\index.dat",
			  'delayload' =&gt 1,
		      );
	my $browser = LWP::UserAgent-&gtnew;
	$browser-&gtcookie_jar( $cookie_jar );

DESCRIPTION
       This is a subclass of "HTTP::Cookies" which loads Microsoft Internet
       Explorer 5.x and 6.x for Windows (MSIE) cookie files.

       See the documentation for HTTP::Cookies.

METHODS
       The following methods are provided:

       $cookie_jar = HTTP::Cookies::Microsoft-&gtnew;
	   The constructor takes hash style parameters. In addition to the
	   regular HTTP::Cookies parameters, HTTP::Cookies::Microsoft
	   recognizes the following:

	     delayload:       delay loading of cookie data until a request
			      is actually made. This results in faster
			      runtime unless you use most of the cookies
			      since only the domain's cookie data
			      is loaded on demand.

CAVEATS
       Please note that the code DOESN'T support saving to the MSIE cookie
       file format.
