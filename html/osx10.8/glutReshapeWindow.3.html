NAME
       glutReshapeWindow  -  requests a change to the size of the current win-
       dow.

SYNTAX
       #include <GLUT/glut.h>

       void glutReshapeWindow(int width, int height);

ARGUMENTS
       width	 New width of window in pixels.

       height	 New height of window in pixels.

DESCRIPTION
       glutReshapeWindow requests a change in the size of the current  window.
       The  width and height parameters are size extents in pixels.  The width
       and height must be positive values.

       The requests by glutReshapeWindow are not processed  immediately.   The
       request is executed after returning to the main event loop. This allows
       multiple  glutReshapeWindow,  glutPositionWindow,  and	glutFullScreen
       requests to the same window to be coalesced.

       In  the	case of top-level windows, a glutReshapeWindow call is consid-
       ered only a request for sizing the window. The window system is free to
       apply  its  own policies to top-level window sizing. The intent is that
       top-level windows  should  be  reshaped	according  glutReshapeWindow's
       parameters.  Whether  a	reshape  actually takes effect and, if so, the
       reshaped dimensions are reported to the program by a reshape  callback.

       glutReshapeWindow disables the full screen status of a window if previ-
       ously enabled.
