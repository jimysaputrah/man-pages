NAME
       Convert::UUlib - Perl interface to the uulib library (a.k.a.
       uudeview/uuenview).

SYNOPSIS
	use Convert::UUlib ':all';

	# read all the files named on the commandline and decode them
	# into the CURRENT directory. See below for a longer example.
	LoadFile $_ for @ARGV;
	for (my $i = 0; my $uu = GetFileListItem $i; $i++) {
	   if ($uu-&gtstate & FILE_OK) {
	     $uu-&gtdecode;
	     print $uu-&gtfilename, "\n";
	   }
	}

DESCRIPTION
       Read the file doc/library.pdf from the distribution for in-depth
       information about the C-library used in this interface, and the rest of
       this document and especially the non-trivial decoder program at the
       end.

EXPORTED FUNCTIONS
   Initializing and cleanup
       Initialize is automatically called when the module is loaded and
       allocates quite a small amount of memory for todays machines ;) CleanUp
       releases that again.

       On my machine, a fairly complete decode with DBI backend needs about
       10MB RSS to decode 20000 files.

       Initialize
	   Not normally necessary, (re-)initializes the library.

       CleanUp
	   Not normally necessary, could be called at the end to release
	   memory before starting a new decoding round.

   Setting and querying options
       $option = GetOption OPT_xxx
       SetOption OPT_xxx, opt-value

       See the "OPT_xxx" constants above to see which options exist.

   Setting various callbacks
       SetMsgCallback [callback-function]
       SetBusyCallback [callback-function]
       SetFileCallback [callback-function]
       SetFNameFilter [callback-function]

   Call the currently selected FNameFilter
       $file = FNameFilter $file

   Loading sourcefiles, optionally fuzzy merge and start decoding
       ($retval, $count) = LoadFile $fname, [$id, [$delflag, [$partno]]]
	   Load the given file and scan it for encoded contents. Optionally
	   tag it with the given id, and if $delflag is true, delete the file
	   after it is no longer necessary. If you are certain of the part
	   number, you can specify it as the last argument.

	   A better (usually faster) way of doing this is using the
	   "SetFNameFilter" functionality.

       $retval = Smerge $pass
	   If you are desperate, try to call "Smerge" with increasing $pass
	   values, beginning at 0, to try to merge parts that usually would
	   not have been merged.

	   Most probably this will result in garbled files, so never do this
	   by default, except:

	   If the "OPT_AUTOCHECK" option has been disabled (by default it is
	   enabled) to speed up file loading, then you have to call "Smerge
	   -1" after loading all files as an additional pre-pass (which is
	   normally done by "LoadFile").

       $item = GetFileListItem $item_number
	   Return the $item structure for the $item_number'th found file, or
	   "undef" of no file with that number exists.

	   The first file has number 0, and the series has no holes, so you
	   can iterate over all files by starting with zero and incrementing
	   until you hit "undef".

   Decoding files
       $retval = $item-&gtrename($newname)
	   Change the ondisk filename where the decoded file will be saved.

       $retval = $item-&gtdecode_temp
	   Decode the file into a temporary location, use "$item-&gtinfile" to
	   retrieve the temporary filename.

       $retval = $item-&gtremove_temp
	   Remove the temporarily decoded file again.

       $retval = $item-&gtdecode([$target_path])
	   Decode the file to it's destination, or the given target path.

       $retval = $item-&gtinfo(callback-function)

   Querying (and setting) item attributes
       $state	 = $item-&gtstate
       $mode	 = $item-&gtmode([newmode])
       $uudet	 = $item-&gtuudet
       $size	 = $item-&gtsize
       $filename = $item-&gtfilename([newfilename})
       $subfname = $item-&gtsubfname
       $mimeid	 = $item-&gtmimeid
       $mimetype = $item-&gtmimetype
       $binfile  = $item-&gtbinfile

   Information about source parts
       $parts = $item-&gtparts
	   Return information about all parts (source files) used to decode
	   the file as a list of hashrefs with the following structure:

	    {
	      partno   =&gt &ltinteger describing the part number, starting with 1&gt,
	      # the following member sonly exist when they contain useful information
	      sfname   =&gt &ltlocal pathname of the file where this part is from&gt,
	      filename =&gt &ltthe ondisk filename of the decoded file&gt,
	      subfname =&gt &ltused to cluster postings, possibly the posting filename&gt,
	      subject  =&gt &ltthe subject of the posting/mail&gt,
	      origin   =&gt &ltthe possible source (From) address&gt,
	      mimetype =&gt &ltthe possible mimetype of the decoded file&gt,
	      mimeid   =&gt &ltthe id part of the Content-Type&gt,
	    }

	   Usually you are interested mostly the "sfname" and possibly the
	   "partno" and "filename" members.

   Functions below not documented and not very well tested
	 QuickDecode
	 EncodeMulti
	 EncodePartial
	 EncodeToStream
	 EncodeToFile
	 E_PrepSingle
	 E_PrepPartial

   EXTENSION FUNCTIONS
       Functions found in this module but not documented in the uulib
       documentation:

       $msg = straction ACT_xxx
	   Return a human readable string representing the given action code.

       $msg = strerror RET_xxx
	   Return a human readable string representing the given error code.

       $str = strencoding xxx_ENCODED
	   Return the name of the encoding type as a string.

       $str = strmsglevel MSG_xxx
	   Returns the message level as a string.

       SetFileNameCallback $cb
	   Sets (or queries) the FileNameCallback, which is called whenever
	   the decoding library can't find a filename and wants to extract a
	   filename from the subject line of a posting. The callback will be
	   called with two arguments, the subject line and the current
	   candidate for the filename. The latter argument can be "undef",
	   which means that no filename could be found (and likely no one
	   exists, so it is safe to also return "undef" in this case). If it
	   doesn't return anything (not even "undef"!), then nothing happens,
	   so this is a no-op callback:

	      sub cb {
		 return ();
	      }

	   If it returns "undef", then this indicates that no filename could
	   be found. In all other cases, the return value is taken to be the
	   filename.

	   This is a slightly more useful callback:

	     sub cb {
		return unless $_[1]; # skip "Re:"-plies et al.
		my ($subject, $filename) = @_;
		# if we find some *.rar, take it
		return $1 if $subject =~ /(\w+\.rar)/;
		# otherwise just pass what we have
		return ();
	     }

LARGE EXAMPLE DECODER
       This is the file "example-decoder" from the distribution, put here
       instead of more thorough documentation.

	     local $_ = $_[0];

	     # the following rules are rather effective on some newsgroups,

	     # is very common

	     # if we find some *.rar, take it as the filename
	     return $1 if /(\S{3,}\.(?:[rstuvwxyz]\d\d|rar))\s/i;
