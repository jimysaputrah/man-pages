NAME
       MooseX::AuthorizedMethods - Syntax sugar for authorized methods

SYNOPSIS
	 package Foo::Bar;
	 use MooseX::AuthorizedMethods; # includes Moose

	 has user => (is => 'ro');

	 authorized foo => ['foo'], sub {
	    # this is going to happen only if the user has the 'foo' role
	 };

DESCRIPTION
       This method exports the "authorized" declarator that makes a
       verification if the user has the required permissions before the acual
       invocation. The default verification method will take the "user" method
       result and call "roles" to list the roles given to that user.

DECLARATOR
       authorized $name => [qw(required permissions)], $code
	   This declarator will use the default verifier to check if the user
	   has one of the given roles, it will die otherwise.

CUSTOM VERIFIERS
       The default verifier used is
       MooseX::Meta::Method::Authorized::CheckRoles, you might send an
       additional "verifier" option to the declarator with another object or
       class. A verifier is simply a duck type with the "authorized_do" method
       that is called as:

	 $verifier->authorized_do($method, $code, @_)

       It is expected that the verifier code die if the user doesn't fulfill
       the authorization requests.
