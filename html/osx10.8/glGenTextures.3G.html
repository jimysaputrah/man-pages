NAME
       glGenTextures - generate texture names

C SPECIFICATION
       void glGenTextures(GLsizei n, GLuint * textures);

PARAMETERS
       n
	   Specifies the number of texture names to be generated.

       textures
	   Specifies an array in which the generated texture names are stored.

DESCRIPTION
       glGenTextures returns n texture names in textures. There is no
       guarantee that the names form a contiguous set of integers; however, it
       is guaranteed that none of the returned names was in use immediately
       before the call to glGenTextures.

       The generated textures have no dimensionality; they assume the
       dimensionality of the texture target to which they are first bound (see
       glBindTexture()).

       Texture names returned by a call to glGenTextures are not returned by
       subsequent calls, unless they are first deleted with
       glDeleteTextures().

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if n is negative.

ASSOCIATED GETS
       glIsTexture()
