NAME
       Net::Server::Fork - Net::Server personality

SYNOPSIS
	 use Net::Server::Fork;
	 @ISA = qw(Net::Server::Fork);

	 sub process_request {
	    #...code...
	 }

	 __PACKAGE__->run();

DESCRIPTION
       Please read the pod on Net::Server first.  This module is a
       personality, or extension, or sub class, of the Net::Server module.

       This personality binds to one or more ports and then waits for a client
       connection.  When a connection is received, the server forks a child.
       The child handles the request and then closes.

       With the exception of parent/child signaling, this module will work
       (with basic functionality) on Win32 systems.

ARGUMENTS
       check_for_dead
	   Number of seconds to wait before looking for dead children.	This
	   only takes place if the maximum number of child processes
	   (max_servers) has been reached.  Default is 60 seconds.

       max_servers
	   The maximum number of children to fork.  The server will not accept
	   connections until there are free children. Default is 256 children.

       max_dequeue
	   The maximum number of dequeue processes to start.  If a value of
	   zero or undef is given, no dequeue processes will be started.  The
	   number of running dequeue processes will be checked by the
	   check_for_dead variable.

       check_for_dequeue
	   Seconds to wait before forking off a dequeue process.  It is
	   intended to use the dequeue process to take care of items such as
	   mail queues.  If a value of undef is given, no dequeue processes
	   will be started.

CONFIGURATION FILE
       See Net::Server.

PROCESS FLOW
       Process flow follows Net::Server until the post_accept phase.  At this
       point a child is forked.  The parent is immediately able to wait for
       another request.  The child handles the request and then exits.

HOOKS
       The Fork server has the following hooks in addition to the hooks
       provided by the Net::Server base class.	See Net::Server

       "$self->pre_accept_hook()"
	   This hook occurs just before the accept is called.

       "$self->pre_fork_hook()"
	   This hook occurs just after accept but before the fork.

       "$self->post_accept_hook()"
	   This hook occurs in the child after the accept and fork.

       "$self->run_dequeue()"
	   This hook only gets called in conjuction with the check_for_dequeue
	   setting.

TO DO
       See Net::Server
