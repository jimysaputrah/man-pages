DESCRIPTION
       glConvolutionFilter1D  builds a one-dimensional convolution filter ker-
       nel from an array of pixels.

       The pixel  array  specified  by	width,	format,  type,	and  image  is
       extracted  from	memory	and  processed	just  as  if glDrawPixels were
       called, but processing stops after the final expansion to RGBA is  com-
       pleted.

       The R, G, B, and A components of each pixel are next scaled by the four
       1D GL_CONVOLUTION_FILTER_SCALE parameters and biased  by  the  four  1D
       GL_CONVOLUTION_FILTER_BIAS  parameters.	(The scale and bias parameters
       are set by glConvolutionParameter using	the  GL_CONVOLUTION_1D	target
       and	  the	     names	 GL_CONVOLUTION_FILTER_SCALE	   and
       GL_CONVOLUTION_FILTER_BIAS.  The parameters themselves are  vectors  of
       four  values  that  are applied to red, green, blue, and alpha, in that
       order.)	The R, G, B, and A values are not clamped to [0,1] at any time
       during this process.

       Each pixel is then converted to the internal  specified by internalfor-
       mat.  This conversion simply maps the component values of the pixel (R,
       G, B, and A) to the values included in the internal  (red, green, blue,
       alpha, luminance, and intensity).  The mapping is as follows:



	Internal Format     Channel mapping
	GL_ALPHA	    A=Alpha
	GL_LUMINANCE	    R=Luminance
	GL_LUMINANCE_ALPHA  A=Alpha, R=Luminance
	GL_INTENSITY	    R=Intensity
	GL_RGB		    R=Red, G=Green, B=Blue
	GL_RGBA 	    R=Red, G=Green, B=Blue, A=Alpha


       The red, green, blue, alpha, luminance, and/or intensity components  of
       the  resulting  pixels are stored in floating-point rather than integer
       They form a one-dimensional filter kernel image indexed with coordinate
       i  such	that  i  starts at 0 and increases from left to right.	Kernel
       location i is derived from the ith pixel, counting from 0.

       Note that after a convolution is performed, the resulting color	compo-
       nents	  are	   also      scaled	by     their	 corresponding
       GL_POST_CONVOLUTION_c_SCALE parameters and biased by their  correspond-
       ing  GL_POST_CONVOLUTION_c_BIAS parameters (where c takes on the values
       RED,  GREEN,  BLUE,  and  ALPHA).   These   parameters	are   set   by
       glPixelTransfer.

NOTES
       glConvolutionFilter1D  is  present  only  if GL_ARB_imaging is returned
       when glGetString is called with an argument of GL_EXTENSIONS.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if target is not GL_CONVOLUTION_1D.

       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if internalformat is not one of the allow-
       able values.

       GL_INVALID_VALUE  is  generated	if  width is less than zero or greater
       than the maximum supported value.   This  value	may  be  queried  with
       glGetConvolutionParameter   using  target  GL_CONVOLUTION_1D  and  name
       GL_MAX_CONVOLUTION_WIDTH.

       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if format is not one of the allowable val-
       ues.

       GL_INVALID_ENUM	is  generated if type is not one of the allowable val-
       ues.

       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if glConvolutionFilter1D is  executed
       between	the  execution	of  glBegin and the corresponding execution of
       glEnd.

       GL_INVALID_OPERATION   is   generated   if    format    is    one    of
       GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE_3_3_2,			   GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE_2_3_3_REV,
       GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT_5_6_5, or GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT_5_6_5_REV and type is not
       GL_RGB.

       GL_INVALID_OPERATION    is    generated	  if	format	 is   one   of
       GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT_4_4_4_4,		GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT_4_4_4_4_REV,
       GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT_5_5_5_1,		GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT_1_5_5_5_REV,
       GL_UNSIGNED_INT_8_8_8_8, 		  GL_UNSIGNED_INT_8_8_8_8_REV,
       GL_UNSIGNED_INT_10_10_10_2,  or GL_UNSIGNED_INT_2_10_10_10_REV and type
       is neither GL_RGBA nor GL_BGRA.
