NAME
       Pod::Simple::HTMLBatch - convert several Pod files to several HTML
       files

SYNOPSIS
	 perl -MPod::Simple::HTMLBatch -e 'Pod::Simple::HTMLBatch::go' in out

DESCRIPTION
       This module is used for running batch-conversions of a lot of HTML
       documents

       This class is NOT a subclass of Pod::Simple::HTML (nor of bad old
       Pod::Html) -- although it uses Pod::Simple::HTML for doing the
       conversion of each document.

       The normal use of this class is like so:

	 use Pod::Simple::HTMLBatch;
	 my $batchconv = Pod::Simple::HTMLBatch-&gtnew;
	 $batchconv-&gtsome_option( some_value );
	 $batchconv-&gtsome_other_option( some_other_value );
	 $batchconv-&gtbatch_convert( \@search_dirs, $output_dir );

   FROM THE COMMAND LINE
       Note that this class also provides (but does not export) the function
       Pod::Simple::HTMLBatch::go.  This is basically just a shortcut for
       "Pod::Simple::HTMLBatch-&gtbatch_convert(@ARGV)".	It's meant to be handy
       for calling from the command line.

       However, the shortcut requires that you specify exactly two command-
       line arguments, "indirs" and "outdir".

       Example:

	 % mkdir out_html
	 % perl -MPod::Simple::HTMLBatch -e Pod::Simple::HTMLBatch::go @INC out_html
	     (to convert the pod from Perl's @INC
	      files under the directory ../htmlversion)

       (Note that the command line there contains a literal atsign-I-N-C.
       This is handled as a special case by batch_convert, in order to save
       you having to enter the odd-looking "" as the first command-line
       parameter when you mean "just use whatever's in @INC".)

       Example:

	 % mkdir ../seekrut
	 % chmod og-rx ../seekrut
	 % perl -MPod::Simple::HTMLBatch -e Pod::Simple::HTMLBatch::go . ../htmlversion
	     (to convert the pod under the current dir into HTML
	      files under the directory ../htmlversion)

       Example:

	 % perl -MPod::Simple::HTMLBatch -e Pod::Simple::HTMLBatch::go happydocs .
	     (to convert all pod from happydocs into the current directory)

MAIN METHODS
       $batchconv = Pod::Simple::HTMLBatch-&gtnew;
	   This TODO

       $batchconv-&gtbatch_convert( indirs, outdir );
	   this TODO

       $batchconv-&gtbatch_convert( undef    , ...);
       $batchconv-&gtbatch_convert( q{@INC}, ...);
	   These two values for indirs specify that the normal Perl @INC

       $batchconv-&gtbatch_convert( \@dirs , ...);
	   This specifies that the input directories are the items in the
	   arrayref "\@dirs".

       $batchconv-&gtbatch_convert( "somedir" , ...);
	   This specifies that the director "somedir" is the input.  (This can
	   be an absolute or relative path, it doesn't matter.)

	   A common value you might want would be just "." for the current
	   directory:

		$batchconv-&gtbatch_convert( "." , ...);

       $batchconv-&gtbatch_convert( 'somedir:someother:also' , ...);
	   This specifies that you want the dirs "somedir", "somother", and
	   "also" scanned, just as if you'd passed the arrayref "[qw( somedir
	   someother also)]".  Note that a ":"-separator is normal under Unix,
	   but Under MSWin, you'll need 'somedir;someother;also' instead,
	   since the pathsep on MSWin is ";" instead of ":".  (And that is
	   because ":" often comes up in paths, like "c:/perl/lib".)

	   (Exactly what separator character should be used, is gotten from
	   $Config::Config{'path_sep'}, via the Config module.)

       $batchconv-&gtbatch_convert( ... , undef );
	   This specifies that you want the HTML output to go into the current
	   directory.

	   (Note that a missing or undefined value means a different thing in
	   the first slot than in the second.  That's so that
	   "batch_convert()" with no arguments (or undef arguments) means "go
	   from @INC, into the current directory.)

       $batchconv-&gtbatch_convert( ... , 'somedir' );
	   This specifies that you want the HTML output to go into the
	   directory 'somedir'.  (This can be an absolute or relative path, it
	   doesn't matter.)

       Note that you can also call "batch_convert" as a class method, like so:

	 Pod::Simple::HTMLBatch-&gtbatch_convert( ... );

       That is just short for this:

	 Pod::Simple::HTMLBatch-&gt new-&gt batch_convert(...);

       That is, it runs a conversion with default options, for whatever
       inputdirs and output dir you specify.

   ACCESSOR METHODS
       The following are all accessor methods -- that is, they don't do
       anything on their own, but just alter the contents of the conversion
       object, which comprises the options for this particular batch
       conversion.

       We show the "put" form of the accessors below (i.e., the syntax you use
       for setting the accessor to a specific value).  But you can also call
       each method with no parameters to get its current value.  For example,
       "$self-&gtcontents_file()" returns the current value of the contents_file
       attribute.

       $batchconv-&gtverbose( nonnegative_integer );
	   This controls how verbose to be during batch conversion, as far as
	   notes to STDOUT (or whatever is "select"'d) about how the
	   conversion is going.  If 0, no progress information is printed.  If
	   1 (the default value), some progress information is printed.
	   Higher values print more information.

       $batchconv-&gtindex( true-or-false );
	   This controls whether or not each HTML page is liable to have a
	   little table of contents at the top (which we call an "index" for
	   historical reasons).  This is true by default.

       $batchconv-&gtcontents_file( filename );
	   If set, should be the name of a file (in the output directory) to
	   write the HTML index to.  The default value is "index.html".  If
	   you set this to a false value, no contents file will be written.

       $batchconv-&gtcontents_page_start( HTML_string );
	   This specifies what string should be put at the beginning of the
	   contents page.  The default is a string more or less like this:

	     &lthtml&gt
	     &lthead&gt&lttitle&gtPerl Documentation&lt/title&gt&lt/head&gt
	     &ltbody class='contentspage'&gt
	     &lth1&gtPerl Documentation&lt/h1&gt

       $batchconv-&gtcontents_page_end( HTML_string );
	   This specifies what string should be put at the end of the contents
	   page.  The default is a string more or less like this:

	     &ltp class='contentsfooty'&gtGenerated by
	     Pod::Simple::HTMLBatch v3.01 under Perl v5.008
	     &ltbr &gtAt Fri May 14 22:26:42 2004 GMT,
	     which is Fri May 14 14:26:42 2004 local time.&lt/p&gt

       $batchconv-&gtadd_css( $url );
	   TODO

       $batchconv-&gtadd_javascript( $url );
	   TODO

       $batchconv-&gtcss_flurry( true-or-false );
	   If true (the default value), we autogenerate some CSS files in the
	   output directory, and set our HTML files to use those.  TODO:
	   continue

       $batchconv-&gtjavascript_flurry( true-or-false );
	   If true (the default value), we autogenerate a JavaScript in the
	   output directory, and set our HTML files to use it.	Currently, the
	   JavaScript is used only to get the browser to remember what
	   stylesheet it prefers.  TODO: continue

       $batchconv-&gtno_contents_links( true-or-false );
	   TODO

       $batchconv-&gthtml_render_class( classname );
	   This sets what class is used for rendering the files.  The default
	   is "Pod::Simple::HTML".  If you set it to something else, it should
	   probably be a subclass of Pod::Simple::HTML, and you should
	   "require" or "use" that class so that's it's loaded before
	   Pod::Simple::HTMLBatch tries loading it.

       $batchconv-&gtsearch_class( classname );
	   This sets what class is used for searching for the files.  The
	   default is "Pod::Simple::Search".  If you set it to something else,
	   it should probably be a subclass of Pod::Simple::Search, and you
	   should "require" or "use" that class so that's it's loaded before
	   Pod::Simple::HTMLBatch tries loading it.

NOTES ON CUSTOMIZATION
       TODO

	 call add_css($someurl) to add stylesheet as alternate
	 call add_css($someurl,1) to add as primary stylesheet

	 call add_javascript

	 subclass Pod::Simple::HTML and set $batchconv-&gthtml_render_class to
	   that classname
	 and maybe override
	   $page-&gtbatch_mode_page_object_init($self, $module, $infile, $outfile, $depth)
	 or maybe override
	   $batchconv-&gtbatch_mode_page_object_init($page, $module, $infile, $outfile, $depth)
	 subclass Pod::Simple::Search and set $batchconv-&gtsearch_class to
	   that classname

ASK ME!
       If you want to do some kind of big pod-to-HTML version with some
       particular kind of option that you don't see how to achieve using this
       module, email me ("sburke@cpan.org") and I'll probably have a good idea
       how to do it. For reasons of concision and energetic laziness, some
       methods and options in this module (and the dozen modules it depends
       on) are undocumented; but one of those undocumented bits might be just
       what you're looking for.
