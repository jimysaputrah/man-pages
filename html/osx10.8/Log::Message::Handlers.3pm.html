NAME
       Log::Message::Handlers - Message handlers for Log::Message

SYNOPSIS
	   # Implicitly used by Log::Message to serve as handlers for
	   # Log::Message::Item objects

	   # Create your own file with a package called
	   # Log::Message::Handlers to add to the existing ones, or to even
	   # overwrite them

	   $item->carp;

	   $item->trace;

DESCRIPTION
       Log::Message::Handlers provides handlers for Log::Message::Item
       objects.  The handler corresponding to the level (see
       Log::Message::Item manpage for an explanation about levels) will be
       called automatically upon storing the error.

       Handlers may also explicitly be called on an Log::Message::Item object
       if one so desires (see the Log::Message manpage on how to retrieve the
       Item objects).

Default Handlers
   log
       Will simply log the error on the stack, and do nothing special

   carp
       Will carp (see the Carp manpage) with the error, and add the timestamp
       of when it occurred.

   croak
       Will croak (see the Carp manpage) with the error, and add the timestamp
       of when it occurred.

   cluck
       Will cluck (see the Carp manpage) with the error, and add the timestamp
       of when it occurred.

   confess
       Will confess (see the Carp manpage) with the error, and add the
       timestamp of when it occurred

   die
       Will simply die with the error message of the item

   warn
       Will simply warn with the error message of the item

   trace
       Will provide a traceback of this error item back to the first one that
       occurrent, clucking with every item as it comes across it.

Custom Handlers
       If you wish to provide your own handlers, you can simply do the
       following:

       o   Create a file that holds a package by the name of
	   "Log::Message::Handlers"

       o   Create subroutines with the same name as the levels you wish to
	   handle in the Log::Message module (see the Log::Message manpage for
	   explanation on levels)

       o   Require that file in your program, or add it in your configuration
	   (see the Log::Message::Config manpage for explanation on how to use
	   a config file)

       And that is it, the handler will now be available to handle messages
       for you.

       The arguments a handler may receive are those specified by the "extra"
       key, when storing the message.  See the Log::Message manpage for
       details on the arguments.
