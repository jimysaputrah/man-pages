ALTER USER MAPPING(7)	PostgreSQL 9.1.4 Documentation	 ALTER USER MAPPING(7)



NAME
       ALTER_USER_MAPPING - change the definition of a user mapping

SYNOPSIS
       ALTER USER MAPPING FOR { user_name | USER | CURRENT_USER | PUBLIC }
	   SERVER server_name
	   OPTIONS ( [ ADD | SET | DROP ] option ['value'] [, ... ] )

DESCRIPTION
       ALTER USER MAPPING changes the definition of a user mapping.

       The owner of a foreign server can alter user mappings for that server
       for any user. Also, a user can alter a user mapping for his own user
       name if USAGE privilege on the server has been granted to the user.

PARAMETERS
       user_name
	   User name of the mapping.  CURRENT_USER and USER match the name of
	   the current user.  PUBLIC is used to match all present and future
	   user names in the system.

       server_name
	   Server name of the user mapping.

       OPTIONS ( [ ADD | SET | DROP ] option ['value'] [, ... ] )
	   Change options for the user mapping. The new options override any
	   previously specified options.  ADD, SET, and DROP specify the
	   action to be performed.  ADD is assumed if no operation is
	   explicitly specified. Option names must be unique; options are also
	   validated by the server's foreign-data wrapper.

EXAMPLES
       Change the password for user mapping bob, serverfoo:

	   ALTER USER MAPPING FOR bob SERVER foo OPTIONS (user 'bob', password 'public');

COMPATIBILITY
       ALTER USER MAPPING conforms to ISO/IEC 9075-9 (SQL/MED). There is a
       subtle syntax issue: The standard omits the FOR key word. Since both
       CREATE USER MAPPING and DROP USER MAPPING use FOR in analogous
       positions, and IBM DB2 (being the other major SQL/MED implementation)
       also requires it for ALTER USER MAPPING, PostgreSQL diverges from the
       standard here in the interest of consistency and interoperability.

SEE ALSO
       CREATE USER MAPPING (CREATE_USER_MAPPING(7)), DROP USER MAPPING
       (DROP_USER_MAPPING(7))
