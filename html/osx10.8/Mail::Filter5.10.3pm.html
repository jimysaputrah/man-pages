NAME
       Mail::Filter - Filter mail through multiple subroutines

SYNOPSIS
	use Mail::Filter;

	my $filter = Mail::Filter-&gtnew( \&filter1, \&filter2 );

	my $mail   = Mail::Internet-&gtnew( [&lt&gt] );
	my $mail   = $filter-&gtfilter($mail);

	my $folder = Mail::Folder-&gtnew( .... );
	my $filter-&gtfilter($folder);

DESCRIPTION
       "Mail::Filter" provides an interface to filtering Email through
       multiple subroutines.

       "Mail::Filter" filters mail by calling each filter subroutine in turn.
       Each filter subroutine is called with two arguments, the first is the
       filter object and the second is the mail or folder object being
       filtered.

       The result from each filter sub is passed to the next filter as the
       mail object. If a filter subroutine returns undef, then "Mail::Filter"
       will abort and return immediately.

       The function returns the result from the last subroutine to operate on
       the mail object.

METHODS
   Constructors
       Mail::Filter-&gtnew([FILTER [, ... ]])

	   Create a new "Mail::Filter" object with the given filter
	   subroutines. Each filter may be either a code reference or the name
	   of a method to call on the &ltMail::Filter&gt object.

   Accessors
       $obj-&gtadd(FILTER [, FILTER ...])

	   Add the given filters to the end of the fliter list.

   Processing
       $obj-&gtfilter(MAIL-OBJECT | MAIL-FOLDER)

	   If the first argument is a "Mail::Internet" object, then this
	   object will be passed through the filter list. If the first
	   argument is a "Mail::Folder" object, then each message in turn will
	   be passed through the filter list.

       $obj-&gtfolder

	   While the "filter" method is called with a "Mail::Folder" object,
	   these filter subroutines can call this method to obtain the folder
	   object that is being processed.

       $obj-&gtmsgnum

	   If the "filter" method is called with a "Mail::Folder" object, then
	   the filter subroutines may call this method to obtain the message
	   number of the message that is being processed.
