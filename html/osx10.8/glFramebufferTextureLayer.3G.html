NAME
       glFramebufferTextureLayer - attach a single layer of a texture to a
       framebuffer

C SPECIFICATION
       void glFramebufferTextureLayer(GLenum target, GLenum attachment,
				      GLuint texture, GLint level,
				      GLint layer);

PARAMETERS
       target
	   Specifies the framebuffer target.  target must be
	   GL_DRAW_FRAMEBUFFER, GL_READ_FRAMEBUFFER, or GL_FRAMEBUFFER.
	   GL_FRAMEBUFFER is equivalent to GL_DRAW_FRAMEBUFFER.

       attachment
	   Specifies the attachment point of the framebuffer.  attachment must
	   be GL_COLOR_ATTACHMENTi, GL_DEPTH_ATTACHMENT, GL_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT
	   or GL_DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMMENT.

       texture
	   Specifies the texture object to attach to the framebuffer
	   attachment point named by attachment.

       level
	   Specifies the mipmap level of texture to attach.

       layer
	   Specifies the layer of texture to attach.

DESCRIPTION
       glFramebufferTextureLayer operates like glFramebufferTexture(), except
       that only a single layer of the texture level, given by layer, is
       attached to the attachment point. If texture is not zero, layer must be
       greater than or equal to zero.  texture must either be zero or the name
       of an existing three-dimensional texture, one- or two-dimensional array
       texture, or multisample array texture.

NOTES
       glFramebufferTextureLayer is available only if the GL version is 3.2 or
       greater.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if target is not one of the accepted
       tokens.


       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if attachment is not one of the accepted
       tokens.


       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if texture is not zero or the name of an
       existing texture object.


       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if texture is not zero and layer is
       negative.


       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if zero is bound to target.


       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if texture is not zero or the name of
       an existing cube map texture.
