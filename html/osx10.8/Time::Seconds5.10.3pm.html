Time::Seconds(3pm)     Perl Programmers Reference Guide     Time::Seconds(3pm)



NAME
       Time::Seconds - a simple API to convert seconds to other date values

SYNOPSIS
	   use Time::Piece;
	   use Time::Seconds;

	   my $t = localtime;
	   $t += ONE_DAY;

	   my $t2 = localtime;
	   my $s = $t - $t2;

	   print "Difference is: ", $s->days, "\n";

DESCRIPTION
       This module is part of the Time::Piece distribution. It allows the user
       to find out the number of minutes, hours, days, weeks or years in a
       given number of seconds. It is returned by Time::Piece when you delta
       two Time::Piece objects.

       Time::Seconds also exports the following constants:

	   ONE_DAY
	   ONE_WEEK
	   ONE_HOUR
	   ONE_MINUTE
	       ONE_MONTH
	       ONE_YEAR
	       ONE_FINANCIAL_MONTH
	   LEAP_YEAR
	   NON_LEAP_YEAR

       Since perl does not (yet?) support constant objects, these constants
       are in seconds only, so you cannot, for example, do this: "print
       ONE_WEEK->minutes;"

METHODS
       The following methods are available:

	   my $val = Time::Seconds->new(SECONDS)
	   $val->seconds;
	   $val->minutes;
	   $val->hours;
	   $val->days;
	   $val->weeks;
	       $val->months;
	       $val->financial_months; # 30 days
	   $val->years;

       The methods make the assumption that there are 24 hours in a day, 7
       days in a week, 365.24225 days in a year and 12 months in a year.

Bugs
       Currently the methods aren't as efficient as they could be, for reasons
       of clarity. This is probably a bad idea.
