NAME
       DBI::Util::CacheMemory - a very fast but very minimal subset of
       Cache::Memory

DESCRIPTION
       Like Cache::Memory (part of the Cache distribution) but doesn't support
       any fancy features.

       This module aims to be a very fast compatible strict sub-set for simple
       cases, such as basic client-side caching for DBD::Gofer.

       Like Cache::Memory, and other caches in the Cache and Cache::Cache
       distributions, the data will remain in the cache until cleared, it
       expires, or the process dies. The cache object simply going out of
       scope will not destroy the data.

METHODS WITH CHANGES
   new
       All options except "namespace" are ignored.

   set
       Doesn't support expiry.

   purge
       Same as clear() - deletes everything in the namespace.

METHODS WITHOUT CHANGES
       clear
       count
       exists
       remove

UNSUPPORTED METHODS
       If it's not listed above, it's not supported.
