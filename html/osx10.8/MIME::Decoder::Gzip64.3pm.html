NAME
       MIME::Decoder::Gzip64 - decode a "base64" gzip stream

SYNOPSIS
       A generic decoder object; see MIME::Decoder for usage.

DESCRIPTION
       A MIME::Decoder::Base64 subclass for a nonstandard encoding whereby
       data are gzipped, then the gzipped file is base64-encoded.  Common non-
       standard MIME encodings for this:

	   x-gzip64

       Since this class relies on external programs which may not exist on
       your machine, MIME-tools does not "install" it by default.  To use it,
       you need to say in your main program:

	   install MIME::Decoder::Gzip64 'x-gzip64';

       Note: if this class isn't working for you, you may need to change the
       commands it runs.  In your main program, you can do so by setting up
       the two commands which handle the compression/decompression.

	   use MIME::Decoder::Gzip64;

	   $MIME::Decoder::Gzip64::GZIP   = 'gzip -c';
	   $MIME::Decoder::Gzip64::GUNZIP = 'gzip -d -c';
