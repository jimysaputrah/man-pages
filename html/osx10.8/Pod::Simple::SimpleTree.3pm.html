NAME
       Pod::Simple::SimpleTree -- parse Pod into a simple parse tree

SYNOPSIS
	 % cat ptest.pod

	 =head1 PIE

	 I like B<pie>!

	 % perl -MPod::Simple::SimpleTree -MData::Dumper -e \
	    "print Dumper(Pod::Simple::SimpleTree->new->parse_file(shift)->root)" \
	    ptest.pod

	 $VAR1 = [
		   'Document',
		   { 'start_line' => 1 },
		   [
		     'head1',
		     { 'start_line' => 1 },
		     'PIE'
		   ],
		   [
		     'Para',
		     { 'start_line' => 3 },
		     'I like ',
		     [

DESCRIPTION
       This class is of interest to people writing a Pod processor/formatter.

       This class takes Pod and parses it, returning a parse tree made just of
       arrayrefs, and hashrefs, and strings.

       This is a subclass of Pod::Simple and inherits all its methods.

       This class is inspired by XML::Parser's "Tree" parsing-style, although
       it doesn't use exactly the same LoL format.

METHODS
       At the end of the parse, call "$parser->root" to get the tree's top
       node.

Tree Contents
       Every element node in the parse tree is represented by an arrayref of
       the form: "[ elementname, \%attributes, ...subnodes... ]".  See the
       example tree dump in the Synopsis, above.

       Every text node in the tree is represented by a simple (non-ref) string
       scalar.	So you can test "ref($node)" to see whather you have an
       element node or just a text node.

       The top node in the tree is "[ 'Document', \%attributes, ...subnodes...
       ]"
