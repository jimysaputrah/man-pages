DESCRIPTION
       This  command  provides runtime debugging output for variables and com-
       mands without the need to edit your code.  For variables, the  underly-
       ing  mechanism  uses  trace and dump var.  For commands, it renames the
       observed procedure and uses  a  special	wrapper  procedure.   WARNING:
       using  this  procedure  after  checkpointing state will result in major
       problems if you clean state because the renamed (true) commands will be
       lost.

       This procedure is experimental.	Comments are encouraged.

       observe command cmdname ?maxlevel?
	      This will create a wrapper command which prints out (using dump)
	      the call stack to the console.  maxlevel represents the  maximum
	      number  of  levels  of  the  call  stack	which  will be printed
	      (defaults to 4).

       observe cdelete cmdname
	      Removes the wrapper around an observed command.

       observe cinfo cmdname
	      Prints out useless info.

       observe variable varname operation ?args?
	      Currently a wrapper around trace that uses dump to print out the
	      value  of the named variable whenever the specified operation on
	      that variable occurs (must be read, write or unset).

       observe vdelete varname operation
	      Deletes the trace wrapper around the named variable.

       observe vinfo varname
	      Prints out trace info about the named variable.
