DESCRIPTION
     xcodebuild builds one or more targets contained in an Xcode project, or
     builds a scheme contained in an Xcode workspace or Xcode project.

   Usage
     To build an Xcode project, run xcodebuild from the directory containing
     your project (i.e. the directory containing the projectname.xcodeproj
     package). If you have multiple projects in the this directory you will
     need to use -project to indicate which project should be built.  By
     default, xcodebuild builds the first target listed in the project, with
     the default build configuration. The order of the targets is a property
     of the project and is the same for all users of the project.

     To build an Xcode workspace, you must pass both the -workspace and
     -scheme options to define the build.  The parameters of the scheme will
     control which targets are built and how they are built, although you may
     pass other options to xcodebuild to override some parameters of the
     scheme.

     There are also several parameters to display info about the installed
     version of Xcode or about projects or workspaces in the local directory,
     but which do not initiate a build.  These include -version, -showsdks,
     and -usage.

   Options
     -project projectname
	   Build the project specified by projectname.	Required if there are
	   multiple project files in the same directory.

     -target targetname
	   Build the target specified by targetname.

     -alltargets
	   Build all the targets in the specified project.

     -workspace workspacename
	   Build the workspace specified by workspacename.

     -scheme schemename
	   Build the scheme specified by schemename.  Required if building a
	   workspace.

     -configuration configurationname
	   Use the build configuration specified by configurationname when
	   building each target.

     -arch architecture
	   Use the architecture specified by architecture when building each
	   target.

     -sdk [<sdkfullpath> | <sdkname>]
	   Build an Xcode project or workspace against the specified SDK,
	   using build tools appropriate for that SDK. The argument may be an
	   absolute path to an SDK, or the canonical name of an SDK.

     -showsdks
	   Lists all available SDKs that Xcode knows about, including their
	   canonical names suitable for use with -sdk.	Does not initiate a
	   build.

     -list
	   Lists the targets and configurations in a project, or the schemes
	   in a workspace. Does not initiate a build.

     buildaction ...
	   Specify a build action (or actions) to perform on the target.
	   Available build actions are:

	   build       Build the target in the build root (SYMROOT).  This is
		       the default build action.

	   archive     Archive a scheme from the build root (SYMROOT).	This
		       requires specifying a scheme.

	   test        Test a scheme from the build root (SYMROOT).  This
		       requires specifying a scheme.

	   installsrc  Copy the source of the project to the source root
		       (SRCROOT).

	   install     Build the target and install it into the target's
		       installation directory in the distribution root
		       (DSTROOT).

	   clean       Remove build products and intermediate files from the
		       build root (SYMROOT).

     -xcconfig filename
	   Load the build settings defined in filename when building all tar-
	   gets.  These settings will override all other settings, including
	   settings passed individually on the command line.

     setting=value
	   Set the build setting setting to value.

     -userdefault=value
	   Set the user default default to value.

     -version
	   Display version information for this install of Xcode. Does not
	   initiate a build. When used in conjunction with -sdk, the version
	   of the specified SDK is displayed, or all SDKs if -sdk is given no
	   argument.  Additionally, a single line of the reported version
	   information may be returned if infoitem is specified.

     -usage
	   Displays usage information for xcodebuild.

   Environment Variables
     The following environment variables affect the execution of xcodebuild:

     XCODE_XCCONFIG_FILE
		     Set to a path to a file, build settings in that file will
		     be loaded and used when building all targets.  These set-
		     tings will override all other settings, including set-
		     tings passed individually on the command line, and those
		     in the file passed with the -xcconfig option.

   Exit Codes
     xcodebuild exits with codes defined by sysexits(3).  It will exit with
     EX_OK on success.	On failure, it will commonly exit with EX_USAGE if any
     options appear malformed, EX_NOINPUT if any input files cannot be found,
     EX_IOERR if any files cannot be read or written, and EX_SOFTWARE if the
     commands given to xcodebuild fail.  It may exit with other codes in less
     common scenarios.

EXAMPLES
     xcodebuild clean install
	      Cleans the build directory; then builds and installs the first
	      target in the Xcode project in the directory from which
	      xcodebuild was started.

     xcodebuild -target MyTarget OBJROOT=/Build/MyProj/Obj.root
	      SYMROOT=/Build/MyProj/Sym.root
	      Builds the target MyTarget in the Xcode project in the directory
	      from which xcodebuild was started, putting intermediate files in
	      the directory /Build/MyProj/Obj.root and the products of the
	      build in the directory /Build/MyProj/Sym.root.

     xcodebuild -sdk macosx10.6
	      Builds the Xcode project in the directory from which xcodebuild
	      was started against the Mac OS X 10.6 SDK.  The canonical names
	      of all available SDKs can be viewed using the -showsdks option.

     xcodebuild -workspace MyWorkspace.xcworkspace -scheme MyScheme
	      Builds the scheme MyScheme in the Xcode workspace
	      MyWorkspace.xcworkspace.

     xcodebuild -workspace MyWorkspace.xcworkspace -scheme MyScheme archive
	      Archives the scheme MyScheme in the Xcode workspace
	      MyWorkspace.xcworkspace.

     xcodebuild -workspace MyWorkspace.xcworkspace -scheme MyScheme test
	      Tests the scheme MyScheme in the Xcode workspace
	      MyWorkspace.xcworkspace.
