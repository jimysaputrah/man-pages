SYNOPSIS

	     bar($_);
	 }

INHERITANCE
	 PPI::Statement::Compound
	 isa PPI::Statement
	     isa PPI::Node
		 isa PPI::Element

DESCRIPTION
       "PPI::Statement::Compound" objects are used to describe all current
       forms of compound statements, as described in perlsyn.

       This covers blocks using "if", "unless", "for", "foreach", "while", and
       "continue". Please note this does not cover "simple" statements with
       trailing conditions. Please note also that "do" is also not part of a
       compound statement.

	 # This is NOT a compound statement
	 my $foo = 1 if $condition;

	 # This is also not a compound statement
	 do { ... } until $condition;

METHODS
       "PPI::Statement::Compound" has a number of methods in addition to the
       standard PPI::Statement, PPI::Node and PPI::Element methods.

   type
       The "type" method returns the syntactic type of the compound statement.

       There are four basic compound statement types.

       The 'if' type includes all variations of the if and unless statements,
       including any 'elsif' or 'else' parts of the compound statement.

       The 'while' type describes the standard while and until statements, but
       again does not describes simple statements with a trailing while.

       The 'for' type covers the C-style for loops, regardless of whether they
       were declared using 'for' or 'foreach'.

       The 'foreach' type covers loops that iterate over collections,
       regardless of whether they were declared using 'for' or 'foreach'.

       All of the compounds are a variation on one of these four.

       Returns the simple string 'if', 'for', 'foreach' or 'while', or "undef"
       if the type cannot be determined.
