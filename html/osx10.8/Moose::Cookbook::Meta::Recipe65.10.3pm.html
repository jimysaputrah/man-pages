NAME
       Moose::Cookbook::Meta::Recipe6 - A method metaclass for marking methods
       public or private

SYNOPSIS
	 package My::Meta::Method;

	 use Moose;
	 use Moose::Util::TypeConstraints;

	 extends 'Moose::Meta::Method';

	 has '_policy' =&gt (
	     is       =&gt 'ro',
	     isa      =&gt enum( [ qw( public private ) ] ),
	     default  =&gt 'public',
	     init_arg =&gt 'policy',
	 );

	 sub new {
	     my $class	 = shift;
	     my %options = @_;

	     my $self = $class-&gtSUPER::wrap(%options);

	     $self-&gt{_policy} = $options{policy};

	     $self-&gt_add_policy_wrapper;

	     return $self;
	 }

	 sub _add_policy_wrapper {
	     my $self = shift;

	     return if $self-&gtis_public;

	     my $name	   = $self-&gtname;
	     my $package   = $self-&gtpackage_name;
	     my $real_body = $self-&gtbody;

	     my $body = sub {
		 die "The $package\::$name method is private"
		     unless ( scalar caller() ) eq $package;

		 goto &{$real_body};
	     };

	     $self-&gt{body} = $body;
	 }

	 sub is_public	{ $_[0]-&gt_policy eq 'public' }
	 sub is_private { $_[0]-&gt_policy eq 'private' }

	 package MyApp::User;

	 use Moose;

	 has 'password' =&gt ( is =&gt 'rw' );

	 __PACKAGE__-&gtmeta()-&gtadd_method(
	     '_reset_password',
	     My::Meta::Method-&gtnew(
		 name	      =&gt '_reset_password',
		 package_name =&gt __PACKAGE__,
		 body	      =&gt sub { $_[0]-&gtpassword('reset') },
		 policy       =&gt 'private',
	     )
	 );

DESCRIPTION
       This example shows a custom method metaclass that models public versus
       private methods. If a method is defined as private, it adds a wrapper
       around the method which dies unless it is called from the class where
       it was defined.

       The way the method is added to the class is rather ugly. If we wanted
       to make this a real feature, we'd probably want to add some sort of
       sugar to allow us to declare private methods, but that is beyond the
       scope of this recipe. See the Extending recipes for more on this topic.

       The core of our custom class is the "policy" attribute, and
       "_add_policy_wrapper" method.

       You'll note that we have to explicitly set the "policy" attribute in
       our constructor:

	     $self-&gt{policy} = $options{policy};

       That is necessary because Moose metaclasses do not use the meta API to
       create objects. Most Moose classes have a custom "inlined" constructor
       for speed.

       In this particular case, our parent class's constructor is the "wrap"
       method. We call that to build our object, but it does not include
       subclass-specific attributes.

       The "_add_policy_wrapper" method is where the real work is done. If the
       method is private, we construct a wrapper around the real subroutine
       which checks that the caller matches the package in which the
       subroutine was created.

       If they don't match, it dies. If they do match, the real method is
       called. We use "goto" so that the wrapper does not show up in the call
       stack.

       Finally, we replace the value of "$self-&gt{body}". This is another case
       where we have to do something a bit gross because Moose does not use
       Moose for its own implementation.

       When we pass this method object to the metaclass's "add_method" method,
       it will take the method body and make it available in the class.

       Finally, when we retrieve these methods via the introspection API, we
       can call the "is_public" and "is_private" methods on them to get more
       information about the method.

SUMMARY
       A custom method metaclass lets us add both behavior and meta-
       information to methods. Unfortunately, because the Perl interpreter
       does not private easy hooks into method declaration, the API we have
       for adding these methods is not very pretty.

       That can be improved with custom Moose-like sugar, or even by using a
       tool like Devel::Declare to create full-blown new keywords in Perl.
