NAME
       MooseX::Storage::Deferred - A role for undecisive programmers

SYNOPSIS
	 package Point;
	 use Moose;
	 use MooseX::Storage;

	 our $VERSION = '0.01';

	 with 'MooseX::Storage::Deferred';

	 has 'x' =&gt (is =&gt 'rw', isa =&gt 'Int');
	 has 'y' =&gt (is =&gt 'rw', isa =&gt 'Int');

	 1;

	 my $p = Point-&gtnew(x =&gt 10, y =&gt 10);

	 ## methods to freeze/thaw into
	 ## a specified serialization format
	 ## (in this case JSON)

	 # pack the class into a JSON string
	 $p-&gtfreeze({ format =&gt 'JSON' }); # { "__CLASS__" : "Point", "x" : 10, "y" : 10 }

	 # pack the class into a JSON string using parameterized JSONpm role
	 $p-&gtfreeze({ format =&gt [ JSONpm =&gt { json_opts =&gt { pretty =&gt 1 } } ] });

	 # unpack the JSON string into a class
	 my $p2 = Point-&gtthaw(
	     '{ "__CLASS__" : "Point", "x" : 10, "y" : 10 }',
	     { format =&gt 'JSON' }
	 );

DESCRIPTION
       This role is designed for those times when you need to serialize into
       many different formats or I/O options.

       It basically allows you to choose the format and IO options only when
       you actually use them (see the SYNOPSIS for more info)

SUPPORTED FORMATS
       JSON
       JSONpm
       YAML
       Storable

SUPPORTED I/O
       File
       AtomicFile

       NOTE: The StorableFile I/O option is not supported, this is because it
       does not mix well with options who also have a "thaw" and "freeze"
       methods like this. It is possible to probably work around this issue,
       but I don't currently have the need for it. If you need this supported,
       talk to me and I will see what I can do.

METHODS
       freeze ($type_desc)
       thaw ($data, $type_desc)
       load ($filename, $type_desc)
       store ($filename, $type_desc)

   Introspection
       meta

BUGS
       All complex software has bugs lurking in it, and this module is no
       exception. If you find a bug please either email me, or add the bug to
       cpan-RT.
