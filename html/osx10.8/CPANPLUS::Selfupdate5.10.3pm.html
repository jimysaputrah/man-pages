CPANPLUS::Selfupdate(3pPerl Programmers Reference GuiCPANPLUS::Selfupdate(3pm)



NAME
       CPANPLUS::Selfupdate

SYNOPSIS
	   $su	   = $cb->selfupdate_object;

	   @feats  = $su->list_features;
	   @feats  = $su->list_enabled_features;

	   @mods   = map { $su->modules_for_feature( $_ ) } @feats;
	   @mods   = $su->list_core_dependencies;
	   @mods   = $su->list_core_modules;

	   for ( @mods ) {
	       print $_->name " should be version " . $_->version_required;
	       print "Installed version is not uptodate!"
		   unless $_->is_installed_version_sufficient;
	   }

	   $ok	   = $su->selfupdate( update => 'all', latest => 0 );

METHODS
   $self = CPANPLUS::Selfupdate->new( $backend_object );
       Sets up a new selfupdate object. Called automatically when a new
       backend object is created.

   @cat = $self->list_categories
       Returns a list of categories that the "selfupdate" method accepts.

       See "selfupdate" for details.

   %list = $self->list_modules_to_update( update =>
       "core|dependencies|enabled_features|features|all", [latest => BOOL] )
       List which modules "selfupdate" would upgrade. You can update either
       the core (CPANPLUS itself), the core dependencies, all features you
       have currently turned on, or all features available, or everything.

       The "latest" option determines whether it should update to the latest
       version on CPAN, or if the minimal required version for CPANPLUS is
       good enough.

       Returns a hash of feature names and lists of module objects to be
       upgraded based on the category you provided. For example:

	   %list = $self->list_modules_to_update( update => 'core' );

       Would return:

	   ( core => [ $module_object_for_cpanplus ] );

   $bool = $self->selfupdate( update =>
       "core|dependencies|enabled_features|features|all", [latest => BOOL,
       force => BOOL] )
       Selfupdate CPANPLUS. You can update either the core (CPANPLUS itself),
       the core dependencies, all features you have currently turned on, or
       all features available, or everything.

       The "latest" option determines whether it should update to the latest
       version on CPAN, or if the minimal required version for CPANPLUS is
       good enough.

       Returns true on success, false on error.

   @features = $self->list_features
       Returns a list of features that are supported by CPANPLUS.

   @features = $self->list_enabled_features
       Returns a list of features that are enabled in your current CPANPLUS
       installation.

   @mods = $self->modules_for_feature( FEATURE [,AS_HASH] )
       Returns a list of "CPANPLUS::Selfupdate::Module" objects which
       represent the modules required to support this feature.

       For a list of features, call the "list_features" method.

       If the "AS_HASH" argument is provided, no module objects are returned,
       but a hashref where the keys are names of the modules, and values are
       their minimum versions.

   @mods = $self->list_core_dependencies( [AS_HASH] )
       Returns a list of "CPANPLUS::Selfupdate::Module" objects which
       represent the modules that comprise the core dependencies of CPANPLUS.

       If the "AS_HASH" argument is provided, no module objects are returned,
       but a hashref where the keys are names of the modules, and values are
       their minimum versions.

   @mods = $self->list_core_modules( [AS_HASH] )
       Returns a list of "CPANPLUS::Selfupdate::Module" objects which
       represent the modules that comprise the core of CPANPLUS.

       If the "AS_HASH" argument is provided, no module objects are returned,
       but a hashref where the keys are names of the modules, and values are
       their minimum versions.

CPANPLUS::Selfupdate::Module
       "CPANPLUS::Selfupdate::Module" extends "CPANPLUS::Module" objects by
       providing accessors to aid in selfupdating CPANPLUS.

       These objects are returned by all methods of "CPANPLUS::Selfupdate"
       that return module objects.

   $version = $mod->version_required
       Returns the version of this module required for CPANPLUS.

   $bool = $mod->is_installed_version_sufficient
       Returns true if the installed version of this module is sufficient for
       CPANPLUS, or false if it is not.
