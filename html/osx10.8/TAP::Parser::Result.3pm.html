NAME
       TAP::Parser::Result - Base class for TAP::Parser output objects

VERSION
       Version 3.17

SYNOPSIS
	 # abstract class - not meany to be used directly
	 # see TAP::Parser::ResultFactory for preferred usage

	 # directly:
	 use TAP::Parser::Result;
	 my $token  = {...};
	 my $result = TAP::Parser::Result->new( $token );

   DESCRIPTION
       This is a simple base class used by TAP::Parser to store objects that
       represent the current bit of test output data from TAP (usually a
       single line).  Unless you're subclassing, you probably won't need to
       use this module directly.

   METHODS
       "new"

	 # see TAP::Parser::ResultFactory for preferred usage

	 # to use directly:
	 my $result = TAP::Parser::Result->new($token);

       Returns an instance the appropriate class for the test token passed in.

   Boolean methods
       The following methods all return a boolean value and are to be
       overridden in the appropriate subclass.

       o   "is_plan"

	   Indicates whether or not this is the test plan line.

	    1..3

       o   "is_pragma"

	   Indicates whether or not this is a pragma line.

	    pragma +strict

       o   "is_test"

	   Indicates whether or not this is a test line.

	    ok 1 Is OK!

       o   "is_comment"

	   Indicates whether or not this is a comment.

	    # this is a comment

       o   "is_bailout"

	   Indicates whether or not this is bailout line.

	    Bail out! We're out of dilithium crystals.

       o   "is_version"

	   Indicates whether or not this is a TAP version line.

	    TAP version 4

       o   "is_unknown"

	   Indicates whether or not the current line could be parsed.

	    ... this line is junk ...

       o   "is_yaml"

	   Indicates whether or not this is a YAML chunk.

       "raw"

	 print $result->raw;

       Returns the original line of text which was parsed.

       "type"

	 my $type = $result->type;

       Returns the "type" of a token, such as "comment" or "test".

       "as_string"

	 print $result->as_string;

       Prints a string representation of the token.  This might not be the
       exact output, however.  Tests will have test numbers added if not
       present, TODO and SKIP directives will be capitalized and, in general,
       things will be cleaned up.  If you need the original text for the
       token, see the "raw" method.

       "is_ok"

	 if ( $result->is_ok ) { ... }

       Reports whether or not a given result has passed.  Anything which is
       not a test result returns true.	This is merely provided as a
       convenient shortcut.

       "passed"

       Deprecated.  Please use "is_ok" instead.

       "has_directive"

	 if ( $result->has_directive ) {
	    ...
	 }

       Indicates whether or not the given result has a TODO or SKIP directive.

       "has_todo"

	if ( $result->has_todo ) {
	    ...
	}

       Indicates whether or not the given result has a TODO directive.

       "has_skip"

	if ( $result->has_skip ) {
	    ...
	}

       Indicates whether or not the given result has a SKIP directive.

       "set_directive"

       Set the directive associated with this token. Used internally to fake
       TODO tests.

SUBCLASSING
       Please see "SUBCLASSING" in TAP::Parser for a subclassing overview.

       Remember: if you want your subclass to be automatically used by the
       parser, you'll have to register it with "register_type" in
       TAP::Parser::ResultFactory.

       If you're creating a completely new result type, you'll probably need
       to subclass TAP::Parser::Grammar too, or else it'll never get used.

   Example
	 package MyResult;

	 use strict;
	 use vars '@ISA';

	 @ISA = 'TAP::Parser::Result';

	 # register with the factory:
	 TAP::Parser::ResultFactory->register_type( 'my_type' => __PACKAGE__ );

	 sub as_string { 'My results all look the same' }
