NAME
       tkpp - frontend to pp written in Perl/Tk

SYNOPSIS
       tkpp

DESCRIPTION
       Tkpp is a GUI frontend to pp, which can turn perl scripts into stand-
       alone PAR files, perl scripts or executables.

       Below is a short explanation of all available screen elements; it is
       also displayed from the "Help" - "Help Contents" menu item.

   Source file
       The file you want to pack.

   Output file (--output, --par, --perlscript)
       The file you want the source file packed as.  This option recognizes
       the ".par", ".pl" and executable extensions, and supplies the
       corresponding build option automatically.

   Use icon (--icon)
       The icon file you want your output file to use.	This option will only
       work when building Microsoft Windows ".exe" files.  Currently, this
       option only accepts ".ico" files.

   Add modules/files (--add)
       Add the specified items into the package, along with their
       dependencies.  Multiple items should be separated by a comma (",") or
       semicolon (";").

   Exclude modules (--exclude)
       Exclude the given module from the dependency search path and from the
       package.  Multiple modules should be separated by a comma (",") or
       semicolon (";").

   Scan dependencies (--compile, --execute, --noscan)
       Specify the dependency scanning method to use.  See pp for explanations
       of the options.

   GUI (--gui)
       Build an executable that does not have a console window.  This option
       is only applicable on Microsoft Windows, and is ignored when the output
       file is a ".par" file.

   Log (--log)
       Log the output of packaging to a file.  The log file, tkpp.log, will be
       written in the user's home directory.

   Verbose (--verbose)
       Increase verbosity of output; from 1 to 3, 3 being the most verbose.
       This option is ignored if logging is not enabled.

   Build
       Starts building the package.

   File Menu->Preferences
       Specify the location to perl and pp.  They must be set before Tkpp will
       build anything.	The Tkpp configuration file, .tkpprc, is stored in the
       user's home directory.

NOTES
       I write code for a living not literature, so any misspelled words in
       any comments or anything, whoops ;)
