NAME
       appletviewer - Java applet viewer

SYNOPSIS
       appletviewer [ options ] urls ...

DESCRIPTION
       The  appletviewer command connects to the documents or resources desig-
       nated by urls and displays each applet referenced by that  document  in
       its own window.	Note: if the documents referred to by urls do not ref-
       erence any applets with the OBJECT, EMBED, or APPLET tag,  appletviewer
       does nothing.  For details on the HTML tags that appletviewer supports,
       see http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/tooldocs/appletviewertags.html.

OPTIONS
       The following options are supported:

       -debug	 Starts  the  applet  viewer  in the Java debugger, jdb , thus
		 allowing you to debug applets in the document.  (See jdb(1).)

       -encoding encoding_name
		 Specifies the input HTML file encoding name.

       -Joption  Passes  the string option through as a single argument to the
		 Java interpreter which runs the appletviewer.	 The  argument
		 should  not contain spaces.  Multiple argument words must all
		 begin with the prefix -J, which is stripped.  This is	useful
		 for  adjusting  the  compiler's execution environment or com-
		 piler memory usage.
