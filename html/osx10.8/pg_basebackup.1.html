PG_BASEBACKUP(1)	PostgreSQL 9.1.4 Documentation	      PG_BASEBACKUP(1)



NAME
       pg_basebackup - take a base backup of a PostgreSQL cluster

SYNOPSIS
       pg_basebackup [option...]

DESCRIPTION
       pg_basebackup is used to take base backups of a running PostgreSQL
       database cluster. These are taken without affecting other clients to
       the database, and can be used both for point-in-time recovery (see
       Section 24.3, "Continuous Archiving and Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR)",
       in the documentation) and as the starting point for a log shipping or
       streaming replication standby servers (see Section 25.2, "Log-Shipping
       Standby Servers", in the documentation).


       pg_basebackup makes a binary copy of the database cluster files, while
       making sure the system is automatically put in and out of backup mode
       automatically. Backups are always taken of the entire database cluster,
       it is not possible to back up individual databases or database objects.
       For individual database backups, a tool such as pg_dump(1) must be
       used.

       The backup is made over a regular PostgreSQL connection, and uses the
       replication protocol. The connection must be made with a user having
       REPLICATION permissions (see Section 20.2, "Role Attributes", in the
       documentation), and the user must be granted explicit permissions in
       pg_hba.conf. The server must also be configured with max_wal_senders
       set high enough to leave at least one session available for the backup.

       There can be multiple pg_basebackups running at the same time, but it
       is better from a performance point of view to take only one backup, and
       copy the result.

OPTIONS
       The following command-line options control the location and format of
       the output.

       -D directory, --pgdata=directory
	   Directory to write the output to.

	   When the backup is in tar mode, and the directory is specified as -
	   (dash), the tar file will be written to stdout.

	   This parameter is required.

       -F format, --format=format
	   Selects the format for the output.  format can be one of the
	   following:

	   p, plain
	       Write the output as plain files, with the same layout as the
	       current data directory and tablespaces. When the cluster has no
	       additional tablespaces, the whole database will be placed in
	       the target directory. If the cluster contains additional
	       tablespaces, the main data directory will be placed in the
	       target directory, but all other tablespaces will be placed in
	       the same absolute path as they have on the server.

	       This is the default format.

	   t, tar
	       Write the output as tar files in the target directory. The main
	       data directory will be written to a file named base.tar, and
	       all other tablespaces will be named after the tablespace OID.

	       If the value - (dash) is specified as target directory, the tar
	       contents will be written to standard output, suitable for
	       piping to for example gzip. This is only possible if the
	       cluster has no additional tablespaces.

       -x, --xlog
	   Includes the required transaction log files (WAL files) in the
	   backup. This will include all transaction logs generated during the
	   backup. If this option is specified, it is possible to start a
	   postmaster directly in the extracted directory without the need to
	   consult the log archive, thus making this a completely standalone
	   backup.

	       Note
	       The transaction log files are collected at the end of the
	       backup. Therefore, it is necessary for the wal_keep_segments
	       parameter to be set high enough that the log is not removed
	       before the end of the backup. If the log has been rotated when
	       it's time to transfer it, the backup will fail and be unusable.

       -z, --gzip
	   Enables gzip compression of tar file output, with the default
	   compression level. Compression is only available when using the tar
	   format.

       -Z level, --compress=level
	   Enables gzip compression of tar file output, and specifies the
	   compression level (1 through 9, 9 being best compression).
	   Compression is only available when using the tar format.

       The following command-line options control the generation of the backup
       and the running of the program.

       -c fast|spread, --checkpoint=fast|spread
	   Sets checkpoint mode to fast or spread (default).

       -l label, --label=label
	   Sets the label for the backup. If none is specified, a default
	   value of pg_basebackup base backup will be used.

       -P, --progress
	   Enables progress reporting. Turning this on will deliver an
	   approximate progress report during the backup. Since the database
	   may change during the backup, this is only an approximation and may
	   not end at exactly 100%. In particular, when WAL log is included in
	   the backup, the total amount of data cannot be estimated in
	   advance, and in this case the estimated target size will increase
	   once it passes the total estimate without WAL.

	   When this is enabled, the backup will start by enumerating the size
	   of the entire database, and then go back and send the actual
	   contents. This may make the backup take slightly longer, and in
	   particular it will take longer before the first data is sent.

       -v, --verbose
	   Enables verbose mode. Will output some extra steps during startup
	   and shutdown, as well as show the exact file name that is currently
	   being processed if progress reporting is also enabled.

       The following command-line options control the database connection
       parameters.

       -h host, --host=host
	   Specifies the host name of the machine on which the server is
	   running. If the value begins with a slash, it is used as the
	   directory for the Unix domain socket. The default is taken from the
	   PGHOST environment variable, if set, else a Unix domain socket
	   connection is attempted.

       -p port, --port=port
	   Specifies the TCP port or local Unix domain socket file extension
	   on which the server is listening for connections. Defaults to the
	   PGPORT environment variable, if set, or a compiled-in default.

       -U username, --username=username
	   User name to connect as.

       -w, --no-password
	   Never issue a password prompt. If the server requires password
	   authentication and a password is not available by other means such
	   as a .pgpass file, the connection attempt will fail. This option
	   can be useful in batch jobs and scripts where no user is present to
	   enter a password.

       -W, --password
	   Force pg_basebackup to prompt for a password before connecting to a
	   database.

	   This option is never essential, since pg_basebackup will
	   automatically prompt for a password if the server demands password
	   authentication. However, pg_basebackup will waste a connection
	   attempt finding out that the server wants a password. In some cases
	   it is worth typing -W to avoid the extra connection attempt.

       Other, less commonly used, parameters are also available:

       -V, --version
	   Print the pg_basebackup version and exit.

       -?, --help
	   Show help about pg_basebackup command line arguments, and exit.

ENVIRONMENT
       This utility, like most other PostgreSQL utilities, uses the
       environment variables supported by libpq (see Section 31.13,
       "Environment Variables", in the documentation).

NOTES
       The backup will include all files in the data directory and
       tablespaces, including the configuration files and any additional files
       placed in the directory by third parties. Only regular files and
       directories are allowed in the data directory, no symbolic links or
       special device files.

       The way PostgreSQL manages tablespaces, the path for all additional
       tablespaces must be identical whenever a backup is restored. The main
       data directory, however, is relocatable to any location.

EXAMPLES
       To create a base backup of the server at mydbserver and store it in the
       local directory /usr/local/pgsql/data:

	   $ pg_basebackup -h mydbserver -D /usr/local/pgsql/data

       To create a backup of the local server with one compressed tar file for
       each tablespace, and store it in the directory backup, showing a
       progress report while running:

	   $ pg_basebackup -D backup -Ft -z -P

       To create a backup of a single-tablespace local database and compress
       this with bzip2:

	   $ pg_basebackup -D - -Ft | bzip2 &gt backup.tar.bz2

       (This command will fail if there are multiple tablespaces in the
       database.)
