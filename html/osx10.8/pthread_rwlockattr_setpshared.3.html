PTHREAD_RWLOCKATTR_SE... BSD Library Functions Manual PTHREAD_RWLOCKATTR_SE...

NAME
     pthread_rwlockattr_setpshared -- set the process shared attribute

SYNOPSIS
     #include <pthread.h>

     int
     pthread_rwlockattr_setpshared(pthread_rwlockattr_t *attr, int pshared);

DESCRIPTION
     The pthread_rwlockattr_setpshared() function sets the process-shared
     attribute of attr to the value referenced by pshared.  pshared may be one
     of two values:

     PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED   Any thread of any process that has access to the
			      memory where the read/write lock resides can
			      manipulate the lock.

     PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE  Only threads created within the same process as
			      the thread that initialized the read/write lock
			      can manipulate the lock.	This is the default
			      value.

RETURN VALUES
     If successful, the pthread_rwlockattr_setpshared() function will return
     zero.  Otherwise, an error number will be returned to indicate the error.

SEE ALSO
     pthread_rwlock_init(3), pthread_rwlockattr_init(3),
     pthread_rwlockattr_setpshared(3)

STANDARDS
     The pthread_rwlockattr_setpshared() function is expected to conform to
     Version 2 of the Single UNIX Specification (``SUSv2'').

ERRORS
     pthread_rwlockattr_setpshared() will fail if:

     [EINVAL]		The value specified by attr or pshared is invalid.
