NAME
       glPushClientAttrib,   glPopClientAttrib	-  push  and  pop  the	client
       attribute stack


C SPECIFICATION
       void glPushClientAttrib( GLbitfield mask )


PARAMETERS
       mask  Specifies a mask that indicates which attributes to save.	Values
	     for mask are listed below.

C SPECIFICATION
       void glPopClientAttrib( void )


DESCRIPTION
       glPushClientAttrib  takes  one  argument,  a  mask that indicates which
       groups of client-state variables to save on the client attribute stack.
       Symbolic constants are used to set bits in the mask.  mask is typically
       constructed by OR'ing several of these constants together.  The special
       mask GL_CLIENT_ALL_ATTRIB_BITS can be used to save all stackable client
       state.

       The symbolic mask constants and their associated GL client state are as
       follows (the second column lists which attributes are saved):

       GL_CLIENT_PIXEL_STORE_BIT     Pixel storage modes
       GL_CLIENT_VERTEX_ARRAY_BIT    Vertex arrays (and enables)

       glPopClientAttrib  restores  the  values  of the client-state variables
       saved with the last  glPushClientAttrib.   Those  not  saved  are  left
       unchanged.

       It  is  an error to push attributes onto a full client attribute stack,
       or to pop attributes off an empty stack.  In  either  case,  the  error
       flag is set, and no other change is made to GL state.

       Initially, the client attribute stack is empty.

NOTES
       glPushClientAttrib  is  available  only	if  the  GL  version is 1.1 or
       greater.

       Not all values for GL client state can be saved on the attribute stack.
       For example, select and feedback state cannot be saved.

       The  depth of the attribute stack depends on the implementation, but it
       must be at least 16.

       Use glPushAttrib and glPopAttrib to push and  restore  state  which  is
       kept on the server. Only pixel storage modes and vertex array state may
       be pushed and popped with glPushClientAttrib and glPopClientAttrib.

       When the GL_ARB_multitexture extension is supported, pushing  and  pop-
       ping  client  vertex array state apples to all supported texture units,
       and the active client texture state.

ERRORS
       GL_STACK_OVERFLOW is generated if glPushClientAttrib  is  called  while
       the attribute stack is full.

       GL_STACK_UNDERFLOW  is  generated  if glPopClientAttrib is called while
       the attribute stack is empty.

ASSOCIATED GETS
       glGet with argument GL_ATTRIB_STACK_DEPTH
       glGet with argument GL_MAX_CLIENT_ATTRIB_STACK_DEPTH
