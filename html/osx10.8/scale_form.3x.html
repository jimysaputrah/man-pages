NAME
       form_win - make and break form window and subwindow associations

SYNOPSIS
       #include &ltform.h&gt
       int set_form_win(FORM *form, WINDOW *win);
       WINDOW *form_win(const FORM *form);
       int set_form_sub(FORM *form, WINDOW *sub);
       WINDOW *form_sub(const FORM *form);
       int scale_form(const FORM *form, int *rows, int *columns);

DESCRIPTION
       Every  form  has an associated pair of curses windows.  The form window
       displays any title and border associated with the window; the form sub-
       window  displays the items of the form that are currently available for
       selection.

       The first four functions get and set those windows.  It is  not	neces-
       sary  to set either window; by default, the driver code uses stdscr for
       both.

       In the set_ functions, window argument of NULL is treated as though  it
       were stsdcr.  A form argument of NULL is treated as a request to change
       the system default form window or subwindow.

       The function scale_form returns the minimum size required for the  sub-
       window of form.

RETURN VALUE
       Routines  that  return  pointers  return  NULL on error.  Routines that
       return an integer return one of the following error codes:

       E_OK The routine succeeded.

       E_SYSTEM_ERROR
	    System error occurred (see errno).

       E_BAD_ARGUMENT
	    Routine detected an incorrect or out-of-range argument.

       E_POSTED
	    The form has already been posted.

       E_NOT_CONNECTED
	    No items are connected to the form.

SEE ALSO
       curses(3X), form(3X).

NOTES
       The  header  file  &ltform.h&gt  automatically  includes  the  header  file
       &ltcurses.h&gt.

PORTABILITY
       These  routines emulate the System V forms library.  They were not sup-
       ported on Version 7 or BSD versions.
