NAME
       DBD::Gofer::Policy::rush - The 'rush' policy for DBD::Gofer

SYNOPSIS
	 $dbh = DBI->connect("dbi:Gofer:transport=...;policy=rush", ...)

DESCRIPTION
       The "rush" policy tries to make as few round-trips as possible.	It's
       the opposite end of the policy spectrum to the "pedantic" policy.

       Temporary docs: See the source code for list of policies and their
       defaults.

       In a future version the policies and their defaults will be defined in
       the pod and parsed out at load-time.
