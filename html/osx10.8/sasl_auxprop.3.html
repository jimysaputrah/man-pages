DESCRIPTION
       SASL  auxilliary properties are used to obtain properties from external
       sources during the authentication process.  For	example,  a  mechanism
       might need to query an LDAP server to obtain the authentication secret.
       The application probabally needs other information from there as  well,
       such  as  home  directory  or  UID.   The auxilliary property interface
       allows the two to cooperate, and only results in a single query	agains
       the LDAP server (or other property sources).

       Property  lookups  take	place  directly  after	user  canonicalization
       occurs.	Therefore, all requests should be registered witht he  context
       before  that time.  Note that requests can also be registered using the
       sasl_auxprop_request(3) function.  Most of the functions listed	below,
       however,  require  a  property  context whch can be obtained by calling
       sasl_auxprop_getctx(3).


API Description
       struct propctx *prop_new(unsigned estimate)
	       Create a new property context.  Probabally unnecessary for app-
	       plication developers to call this at any point.

	       estimate is the estimate of storage needed total for requests &
	       responses.  A value of 0 will imply the library default.


       int prop_dup(struct propctx *src_ctx, struct propctx *dst_ctx)

	       Duplicate a given property context.


       int prop_request(struct propctx *ctx, const char **names)

	       Add properties to the request list of a given context.

	       names is the NULL-terminated array of property names, and  must
	       persist	until  the requests are cleared or the context is dis-
	       posed of with a call to prop_dispose.


       const struct propval *prop_get(struct propctx *ctx)

	       Returns a NULL-terminated array	of  struct  propval  from  the
	       given context.


       int prop_getnames(struct propctx *ctx, const char **names,
				 struct porpval *vals)

	       Fill in a (provided) array of struct propval based on a list of
	       property names.	This implies that the vals array is  at  least
	       as  long  as  the names array. The values that are filled in by
	       this call persist until next call to prop_request,  prop_clear,
	       or  prop_dispose on context.  If a name secified here was never
	       requested, that its associated values  entry  will  be  set  to
	       NULL.

	       Returns	number	of  matching  properties that were found, or a
	       SASL error code.


       void prop_clear(struct propctx *ctx, int requests)

	       Clear values and optionally requests from a property context.

	       requests is 1 if the requests should be cleared, 0 otherwise.


       void prop_erase(struct propctx *ctx, const char *name)

	       Securely erase the value of a property.

	       name is the name of the property to erase.


       void prop_dispose(struct propctx **ctx)

	       Disposes of a property context and NULLifys the pointer.


       int prop_format(struct propctx *ctx, const char *sep, int seplen,
			       char   *outbuf,	 unsigned   outmax,   unsigned
	       *outlen)

	       Format  the  requested  property names into a string.  This not
	       intended for use by the application (only by auxprop  plugins).

	       sep Is the seperator to use for the string

	       outbuf Is the caller-allocated buffer of length outmax that the
	       resulting string will be placed in (including NUL  terminator).

	       outlen  if  non-NULL,  will contain the length of the resulting
	       string (excluding NUL terminator).


       int prop_set(struct propctx *ctx, const char *name, const char *value,
			    int vallen)

	       Adds a property vaue to the context.  This is intended for  use
	       by auxprop plugins only.

	       name  is  the name of the property to recieve the new value, or
	       NULL, which implies that the value will be added  to  the  same
	       property as the last call to either prop_set or prop_setvals.

	       value is a value for the property of length vallen


       int  prop_setvals(struct  propctx  *ctx,  const	char *name, const char
       **values)

	       Adds  multiple  values  to a single property.  This is intended
	       for use by auxprop plugins only.

	       name has the same meaning as in prop_set

	       values are a NULL-terminated array of values to	be  added  the
	       property.


RETURN VALUE
       The property functions that return an int return SASL error codes.  See
       sasl_errors(3).	Those that return pointers will return a valid pointer
       on success, or NULL on any error.
