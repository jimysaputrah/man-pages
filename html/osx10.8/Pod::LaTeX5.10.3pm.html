NAME
       Pod::LaTeX - Convert Pod data to formatted Latex

SYNOPSIS
	 use Pod::LaTeX;
	 my $parser = Pod::LaTeX->new ( );

	 $parser->parse_from_filehandle;

	 $parser->parse_from_file ('file.pod', 'file.tex');

DESCRIPTION
       "Pod::LaTeX" is a module to convert documentation in the Pod format
       into Latex. The pod2latex  command uses this module for translation.

       "Pod::LaTeX" is a derived class from Pod::Select.

OBJECT METHODS
       The following methods are provided in this module. Methods inherited
       from "Pod::Select" are not described in the public interface.

   Data Accessors
       The following methods are provided for accessing instance data. These
       methods should be used for accessing configuration parameters rather
       than assuming the object is a hash.

       Default values can be supplied by using these names as keys to a hash
       of arguments when using the "new()" constructor.

       AddPreamble
	   Logical to control whether a "latex" preamble is to be written.  If
	   true, a valid "latex" preamble is written before the pod data is
	   written.  This is similar to:

	     \documentclass{article}
	     \usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
	     \usepackage{textcomp}
	     \begin{document}

	   but will be more complicated if table of contents and indexing are
	   required.  Can be used to set or retrieve the current value.

	     $add = $parser->AddPreamble();
	     $parser->AddPreamble(1);

	   If used in conjunction with "AddPostamble" a full latex document
	   will be written that could be immediately processed by "latex".

	   For some pod escapes it may be necessary to include the amsmath
	   package. This is not yet added to the preamble automaatically.

       AddPostamble
	   Logical to control whether a standard "latex" ending is written to
	   the output file after the document has been processed.  In its
	   simplest form this is simply:

	     \end{document}

	   but can be more complicated if a index is required.	Can be used to
	   set or retrieve the current value.

	     $add = $parser->AddPostamble();
	     $parser->AddPostamble(1);

	   If used in conjunction with "AddPreaamble" a full latex document
	   will be written that could be immediately processed by "latex".

       Head1Level
	   The "latex" sectioning level that should be used to correspond to a
	   pod "=head1" directive. This can be used, for example, to turn a
	   "=head1" into a "latex" "subsection". This should hold a number
	   corresponding to the required position in an array containing the
	   following elements:

	    [0] chapter
	    [1] section
	    [2] subsection
	    [3] subsubsection
	    [4] paragraph
	    [5] subparagraph

	   Can be used to set or retrieve the current value:

	     $parser->Head1Level(2);
	     $sect = $parser->Head1Level;

	   Setting this number too high can result in sections that may not be
	   reproducible in the expected way. For example, setting this to 4
	   would imply that "=head3" do not have a corresponding "latex"
	   section ("=head1" would correspond to a "paragraph").

	   A check is made to ensure that the supplied value is an integer in
	   the range 0 to 5.

	   Default is for a value of 1 (i.e. a "section").

       Label
	   This is the label that is prefixed to all "latex" label and index
	   entries to make them unique. In general, pods have similarly titled
	   sections (NAME, DESCRIPTION etc) and a "latex" label will be
	   multiply defined if more than one pod document is to be included in
	   a single "latex" file. To overcome this, this label is prefixed to
	   a label whenever a label is required (joined with an underscore) or
	   to an index entry (joined by an exclamation mark which is the
	   normal index separator). For example, "\label{text}" becomes
	   "\label{Label_text}".

	   Can be used to set or retrieve the current value:

	     $label = $parser->Label;
	     $parser->Label($label);

	   This label is only used if "UniqueLabels" is true.  Its value is
	   set automatically from the "NAME" field if "ReplaceNAMEwithSection"
	   is true. If this is not the case it must be set manually before
	   starting the parse.

	   Default value is "undef".

       LevelNoNum
	   Control the point at which "latex" section numbering is turned off.
	   For example, this can be used to make sure that "latex" sections
	   are numbered but subsections are not.

	   Can be used to set or retrieve the current value:

	     $lev = $parser->LevelNoNum;
	     $parser->LevelNoNum(2);

	   The argument must be an integer between 0 and 5 and is the same as
	   the number described in "Head1Level" method description. The number
	   has nothing to do with the pod heading number, only the "latex"
	   sectioning.

	   Default is 2. (i.e. "latex" subsections are written as
	   "subsection*" but sections are numbered).

       MakeIndex
	   Controls whether "latex" commands for creating an index are to be
	   inserted into the preamble and postamble

	     $makeindex = $parser->MakeIndex;
	     $parser->MakeIndex(0);

	   Irrelevant if both "AddPreamble" and "AddPostamble" are false (or
	   equivalently, "UserPreamble" and "UserPostamble" are set).

	   Default is for an index to be created.

       ReplaceNAMEwithSection
	   This controls whether the "NAME" section in the pod is to be
	   translated literally or converted to a slightly modified output
	   where the section name is the pod name rather than "NAME".

	   If true, the pod segment

	     =head1 NAME

	     pod::name - purpose

	     =head1 SYNOPSIS

	   is converted to the "latex"

	     \section{pod::name\label{pod_name}\index{pod::name}}

	     Purpose

	     \subsection*{SYNOPSIS\label{pod_name_SYNOPSIS}%
			  \index{pod::name!SYNOPSIS}}

	   (dependent on the value of "Head1Level" and "LevelNoNum"). Note
	   that subsequent "head1" directives translate to subsections rather
	   than sections and that the labels and index now include the pod
	   name (dependent on the value of "UniqueLabels").

	   The "Label" is set from the pod name regardless of any current
	   value of "Label".

	     $mod = $parser->ReplaceNAMEwithSection;
	     $parser->ReplaceNAMEwithSection(0);

	   Default is to translate the pod literally.

       StartWithNewPage
	   If true, each pod translation will begin with a "latex"
	   "\clearpage".

	     $parser->StartWithNewPage(1);
	     $newpage = $parser->StartWithNewPage;

	   Default is false.

       TableOfContents
	   If true, a table of contents will be created.  Irrelevant if
	   "AddPreamble" is false or "UserPreamble" is set.

	     $toc = $parser->TableOfContents;
	     $parser->TableOfContents(1);

	   Default is false.

       UniqueLabels
	   If true, the translator will attempt to make sure that each "latex"
	   label or index entry will be uniquely identified by prefixing the
	   contents of "Label". This allows multiple documents to be combined
	   without clashing common labels such as "DESCRIPTION" and "SYNOPSIS"

	     $parser->UniqueLabels(1);
	     $unq = $parser->UniqueLabels;

	   Default is true.

       UserPreamble
	   User supplied "latex" preamble. Added before the pod translation
	   data.

	   If set, the contents will be prepended to the output file before
	   the translated data regardless of the value of "AddPreamble".
	   "MakeIndex" and "TableOfContents" will also be ignored.

       UserPostamble
	   User supplied "latex" postamble. Added after the pod translation
	   data.

	   If set, the contents will be prepended to the output file after the
	   translated data regardless of the value of "AddPostamble".
	   "MakeIndex" will also be ignored.

NOTES
       Compatible with "latex2e" only. Can not be used with "latex" v2.09 or
       earlier.

       A subclass of "Pod::Select" so that specific pod sections can be
       converted to "latex" by using the "select" method.

       Some HTML escapes are missing and many have not been tested.
