AUDIT_WARN(5)		    BSD File Formats Manual		 AUDIT_WARN(5)

NAME
     audit_warn -- alert when audit daemon issues warnings

DESCRIPTION
     The audit_warn script runs when auditd(8) generates warning messages.

     The default audit_warn is a script whose first parameter is the type of
     warning; the script appends its arguments to
     /etc/security/audit_messages.  Administrators may replace this script: a
     more comprehensive one would take different actions based on the type of
     warning.  For example, a low-space warning could result in an email mes-
     sage being sent to the administrator.
