NAME
       glPrioritizeTextures - set texture residence priority


C SPECIFICATION
       void glPrioritizeTextures( GLsizei n,
				  const GLuint *textures,
				  const GLclampf *priorities )


PARAMETERS
       n	   Specifies the number of textures to be prioritized.

       textures    Specifies  an array containing the names of the textures to
		   be prioritized.

       priorities  Specifies an array containing the  texture  priorities.   A
		   priority  given  in an element of priorities applies to the
		   texture named by the corresponding element of textures.

DESCRIPTION
       glPrioritizeTextures assigns the n texture priorities given in  priori-
       ties to the n textures named in textures.

       The  GL	establishes a ``working set'' of textures that are resident in
       texture memory.	These textures may be bound to a texture  target  much
       more  efficiently than textures that are not resident.  By specifying a
       priority for each texture, glPrioritizeTextures allows applications  to
       guide  the  GL  implementation  in determining which textures should be
       resident.

       The priorities given in priorities  are	clamped  to  the  range  [0,1]
       before  they  are  assigned.  0 indicates the lowest priority; textures
       with priority 0 are least likely to be resident.  1 indicates the high-
       est  priority; textures with priority 1 are most likely to be resident.
       However, textures are not guaranteed to	be  resident  until  they  are
       used.

       glPrioritizeTextures silently ignores attempts to prioritize texture 0,
       or any texture name that does not correspond to an existing texture.

       glPrioritizeTextures does not require that any of the textures named by
       textures be bound to a texture target.  glTexParameter may also be used
       to set a texture's priority, but  only  if  the	texture  is  currently
       bound.	This is the only way to set the priority of a default texture.

NOTES
       glPrioritizeTextures is available only if the  GL  version  is  1.1  or
       greater.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if n is negative.

       GL_INVALID_OPERATION  is  generated if glPrioritizeTextures is executed
       between the execution of glBegin and  the  corresponding  execution  of
       glEnd.

ASSOCIATED GETS
       glGetTexParameter with parameter name GL_TEXTURE_PRIORITY retrieves the
       priority of a currently bound texture.
