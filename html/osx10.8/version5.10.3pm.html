DESCRIPTION
       Version objects were added to Perl in 5.10.  This module implements
       version objects for older version of Perl and provides the version
       object API for all versions of Perl.  All previous releases before 0.74
       are deprecated and should not be used due to incompatible API changes.
       Version 0.77 introduces the new 'parse' and 'declare' methods to
       standardize usage.  You are strongly urged to set 0.77 as a minimum in
       your code, e.g.

	 use version 0.77; # even for Perl v.5.10.0

TYPES OF VERSION OBJECTS
       There are two different types of version objects, corresponding to the
       two different styles of versions in use:

       Decimal Versions
	 The classic floating-point number $VERSION.  The advantage to this
	 style is that you don't need to do anything special, just type a
	 number (without quotes) into your source file.

       Dotted Decimal Versions
	 The more modern form of version assignment, with 3 (or potentially
	 more) integers seperated by decimal points (e.g. v1.2.3).  This is
	 the form that Perl itself has used since 5.6.0 was released.  The
	 leading "v" is now strongly recommended for clarity, and will throw a
	 warning in a future release if omitted.

       See "VERSION OBJECT DETAILS" for further information.

DECLARING VERSIONS
       If you have a module that uses a decimal $VERSION (floating point), and
       you do not intend to ever change that, this module is not for you.
       There is nothing that version.pm gains you over a simple $VERSION
       assignment:

	 our $VERSION = 1.02;

       Since Perl v5.10.0 includes the version.pm comparison logic anyways,
       you don't need to do anything at all.

   How to convert a module from decimal to dotted-decimal
       If you have used a decimal $VERSION in the past and wish to switch to a
       dotted-decimal $VERSION, then you need to make a one-time conversion to
       the new format.

       Important Note: you must ensure that your new $VERSION is numerically
       greater than your current decimal $VERSION; this is not always obvious.
       First, convert your old decimal version (e.g. 1.02) to a normalized
       dotted-decimal form:

	 $ perl -Mversion -e 'print version-&gtparse("1.02")-&gtnormal'
	 v1.20.0

       Then increment any of the dotted-decimal components (v1.20.1 or
       v1.21.0).

   How to "declare()" a dotted-decimal version
	 use version 0.77; our $VERSION = version-&gtdeclare("v1.2.3");

       The "declare()" method always creates dotted-decimal version objects.
       When used in a module, you must put it on the same line as "use
       version" to ensure that $VERSION is read correctly by PAUSE and
       installer tools.  You should also add 'version' to the
       'configure_requires' section of your module metadata file.  See
       instructions in ExtUtils::MakeMaker or Module::Build for details.

       Important Note: Even if you pass in what looks like a decimal number
       ("1.2"), a dotted-decimal will be created ("v1.200.0"). To avoid
       confusion or unintentional errors on older Perls, follow these
       guidelines:

       o Always use a dotted-decimal with (at least) three components

       o Always use a leading-v

       o Always quote the version

       If you really insist on using version.pm with an ordinary decimal
       version, use "parse()" instead of declare.  See the "PARSING AND
       COMPARING VERSIONS" for details.

       See also "VERSION OBJECT DETAILS" for more on version number
       conversion, quoting, calculated version numbers and declaring developer
       or "alpha" version numbers.

PARSING AND COMPARING VERSIONS
       If you need to compare version numbers, but can't be sure whether they
       are expressed as numbers, strings, v-strings or version objects,  then
       you can use version.pm to parse them all into objects for comparison.

   How to "parse()" a version
       The "parse()" method takes in anything that might be a version and
       returns a corresponding version object, doing any necessary conversion
       along the way.

       o Dotted-decimal: bare v-strings (v1.2.3) and strings with more than
	 one decimal point and a leading 'v' ("v1.2.3"); NOTE you can
	 technically use a v-string or strings with a leading-v and only one
	 decimal point (v1.2 or "v1.2"), but you will confuse both yourself
	 and others.

       o Decimal: regular decimal numbers (literal or in a string)

       Some examples:

	 $variable   version-&gtparse($variable)
	 ---------   -------------------------
	 1.23	     v1.230.0
	 "1.23"      v1.230.0
	 v1.23	     v1.23.0
	 "v1.23"     v1.23.0
	 "1.2.3"     v1.2.3
	 "v1.2.3"    v1.2.3

       See "VERSION OBJECT DETAILS" for more on version number conversion.

   How to compare version objects
       Version objects overload the "cmp" and "&lt=&gt" operators.	Perl
       automatically generates all of the other comparison operators based on
       those two so all the normal logical comparisons will work.

	 if ( version-&gtparse($v1) == version-&gtparse($v2) ) {
	   # do stuff
	 }

       If a version object is compared against a non-version object, the non-
       object term will be converted to a version object using "parse()".
       This may give surprising results:

	 $v1 = version-&gtparse("v0.95.0");
	 $bool = $v1 &lt 0.96; # FALSE since 0.96 is v0.960.0

       Always comparing to a version object will help avoid surprises:

	 $bool = $v1 &lt version-&gtparse("v0.96.0"); # TRUE

VERSION OBJECT DETAILS
   Equivalence between Decimal and Dotted-Decimal Versions
       When Perl 5.6.0 was released, the decision was made to provide a
       transformation between the old-style decimal versions and new-style
       dotted-decimal versions:

	 5.6.0	  == 5.006000
	 5.005_04 == 5.5.40

       The floating point number is taken and split first on the single
       decimal place, then each group of three digits to the right of the
       decimal makes up the next digit, and so on until the number of
       significant digits is exhausted, plus enough trailing zeros to reach
       the next multiple of three.

       This was the method that version.pm adopted as well.  Some examples may
       be helpful:

				   equivalent
	 decimal    zero-padded    dotted-decimal
	 -------    -----------    --------------
	 1.2	    1.200	   v1.200.0
	 1.02	    1.020	   v1.20.0
	 1.002	    1.002	   v1.2.0
	 1.0023     1.002300	   v1.2.300
	 1.00203    1.002030	   v1.2.30
	 1.002003   1.002003	   v1.2.3

   Quoting rules
       Because of the nature of the Perl parsing and tokenizing routines,
       certain initialization values must be quoted in order to correctly
       parse as the intended version, especially when using the declare or qv
       methods.  While you do not have to quote decimal numbers when creating
       version objects, it is always safe to quote all initial values when
       using version.pm methods, as this will ensure that what you type is
       what is used.

       Additionally, if you quote your initializer, then the quoted value that
       goes in will be be exactly what comes out when your $VERSION is printed
       (stringified).  If you do not quote your value, Perl's normal numeric
       handling comes into play and you may not get back what you were
       expecting.

       If you use a mathematic formula that resolves to a floating point
       number, you are dependent on Perl's conversion routines to yield the
       version you expect.  You are pretty safe by dividing by a power of 10,
       for example, but other operations are not likely to be what you intend.
       For example:

	 $VERSION = version-&gtnew((qw$Revision: 1.4)[1]/10);
	 print $VERSION;	  # yields 0.14
	 $V2 = version-&gtnew(100/9); # Integer overflow in decimal number
	 print $V2;		  # yields something like 11.111.111.100

       Perl 5.8.1 and beyond are able to automatically quote v-strings but
       that is not possible in earlier versions of Perl.  In other words:

	 $version = version-&gtnew("v2.5.4");  # legal in all versions of Perl
	 $newvers = version-&gtnew(v2.5.4);    # legal only in Perl &gt= 5.8.1

   What about v-strings?
       There are two ways to enter v-strings: a bare number with two or more
       decimal points, or a bare number with one or more decimal points and a
       leading 'v' character (also bare).  For example:

	 $vs1 = 1.2.3; # encoded as \1\2\3
	 $vs2 = v1.2;  # encoded as \1\2

       However, the use of bare v-strings to initialize version objects is
       strongly discouraged in all circumstances.  Also, bare v-strings are
       not completely supported in any version of Perl prior to 5.8.1.

       If you insist on using bare v-strings with Perl &gt 5.6.0, be aware of
       the following limitations:

       1) For Perl releases 5.6.0 through 5.8.0, the v-string code merely
       guesses, based on some characteristics of v-strings.  You must use a
       three part version, e.g. 1.2.3 or v1.2.3 in order for this heuristic to
       be successful.

       2) For Perl releases 5.8.1 and later, v-strings have changed in the
       Perl core to be magical, which means that the version.pm code can
       automatically determine whether the v-string encoding was used.

       3) In all cases, a version created using v-strings will have a
       stringified form that has a leading 'v' character, for the simple
       reason that sometimes it is impossible to tell whether one was present
       initially.

   Alpha versions
       For module authors using CPAN, the convention has been to note unstable
       releases with an underscore in the version string. (See CPAN.)
       version.pm follows this convention and alpha releases will test as
       being newer than the more recent stable release, and less than the next
       stable release.	For dotted-decimal versions, only the last element may
       be separated by an underscore:

	 # Declaring
	 use version 0.77; our $VERSION = version-&gtdeclare("v1.2_3");

	 # Parsing
	 $v1 = version-&gtparse("v1.2_3");
	 $v1 = version-&gtparse("1.002_003");

OBJECT METHODS
   is_alpha()
       True if and only if the version object was created with a underscore,
       e.g.

	 version-&gtparse('1.002_03')-&gtis_alpha;	# TRUE
	 version-&gtdeclare('1.2.3_4')-&gtis_alpha; # TRUE

   is_qv()
       True only if the version object is a dotted-decimal version, e.g.

	 version-&gtparse('v1.2.0')-&gtis_qv;	 # TRUE
	 version-&gtdeclare('v1.2')-&gtis_qv;	# TRUE
	 qv('1.2')-&gtis_qv;			# TRUE
	 version-&gtparse('1.2')-&gtis_qv;		# FALSE

   normal()
       Returns a string with a standard 'normalized' dotted-decimal form with
       a leading-v and at least 3 components.

	version-&gtdeclare('v1.2')-&gtnormal;  # v1.2.0
	version-&gtparse('1.2')-&gtnormal;	   # v1.200.0

   numify()
       Returns a value representing the object in a pure decimal form without
       trailing zeroes.

	version-&gtdeclare('v1.2')-&gtnumify;  # 1.002
	version-&gtparse('1.2')-&gtnumify;	   # 1.2

   stringify()
       Returns a string that is as close to the original representation as
       possible.  If the original representation was a numeric literal, it
       will be returned the way perl would normally represent it in a string.
       This method is used whenever a version object is interpolated into a
       string.

	version-&gtdeclare('v1.2')-&gtstringify;	# v1.2
	version-&gtparse('1.200')-&gtstringify;	# 1.200
	version-&gtparse(1.02_30)-&gtstringify;	# 1.023

EXPORTED FUNCTIONS
   qv()
       This function is no longer recommended for use, but is maintained for
       compatibility with existing code.  If you do not want to have it
       exported to your namespace, use this form:

	 use version 0.77 ();
