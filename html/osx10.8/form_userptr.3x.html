NAME
       form_userptr - associate application data with a form item

SYNOPSIS
       #include &ltform.h&gt
       int set_form_userptr(FORM *form, void *userptr);
       void* form_userptr(const FORM *form);

DESCRIPTION
       Every  form  and  every	form item has a field that can be used to hold
       application-specific data (that is,  the  form-driver  code  leaves  it
       alone).	These functions get and set the form user pointer field.

RETURN VALUE
       The  function  form_userptr  returns a pointer (which may be NULL).  It
       does not set errno.

       The function set_form_userptr returns E_OK (success).

SEE ALSO
       curses(3X), form(3X).

NOTES
       The  header  file  &ltform.h&gt  automatically  includes  the  header  file
       &ltcurses.h&gt.

PORTABILITY
       These  routines emulate the System V forms library.  They were not sup-
       ported on Version 7 or BSD versions.

       The user pointer is a void pointer.  We chose not to leave it as a char
       pointer for SVr4 compatibility.
