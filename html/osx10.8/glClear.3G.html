NAME
       glClear - clear buffers to preset values

C SPECIFICATION
       void glClear(GLbitfield mask);

PARAMETERS
       mask
	   Bitwise OR of masks that indicate the buffers to be cleared. The
	   three masks are GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT, GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT, and
	   GL_STENCIL_BUFFER_BIT.

DESCRIPTION
       glClear sets the bitplane area of the window to values previously
       selected by glClearColor, glClearDepth, and glClearStencil. Multiple
       color buffers can be cleared simultaneously by selecting more than one
       buffer at a time using glDrawBuffer().

       The pixel ownership test, the scissor test, dithering, and the buffer
       writemasks affect the operation of glClear. The scissor box bounds the
       cleared region. Alpha function, blend function, logical operation,
       stenciling, texture mapping, and depth-buffering are ignored by
       glClear.


       glClear takes a single argument that is the bitwise OR of several
       values indicating which buffer is to be cleared.

       The values are as follows:

       GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT
	   Indicates the buffers currently enabled for color writing.

       GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT
	   Indicates the depth buffer.

       GL_STENCIL_BUFFER_BIT
	   Indicates the stencil buffer.

       The value to which each buffer is cleared depends on the setting of the
       clear value for that buffer.

NOTES
       If a buffer is not present, then a glClear directed at that buffer has
       no effect.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if any bit other than the three defined
       bits is set in mask.

ASSOCIATED GETS
       glGet() with argument GL_DEPTH_CLEAR_VALUE


       glGet() with argument GL_COLOR_CLEAR_VALUE


       glGet() with argument GL_STENCIL_CLEAR_VALUE
