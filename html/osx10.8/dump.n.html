NAME
       dump - Dump information about Tcl interpreter in TkCon

SYNOPSIS
       dump  method ?-nocomplain? ?-filter pattern? ?--? pattern ?pattern ...?

_________________________________________________________________

DESCRIPTION
       The dump command provides a way for the user to spit out state informa-
       tion about the interpreter in a Tcl readable (and human readable) form.
       It takes the general form:

       dump method ?-nocomplain? ?-filter pattern? ?--? pattern ?pattern  ...?


       The patterns represent glob-style patterns (as in string match  pattern
       $str).	-nocomplain  will  prevent  dump  from throwing an error if no
       items matched the pattern.  -filter is interpreted as  appropriate  for
       the method.  The various methods are:

       dump command args
	      Outputs one or more commands.

       dump procedure args
	      Outputs one or more procs in sourceable form.

       dump variable args
	      Outputs  the values of variables in sourceable form.  Recognizes
	      nested arrays.  The -filter pattern is used as to  filter  array
	      element names and is interepreted as a glob pattern (defaults to
	      {*}).  It is passed down for nested arrays.

       dump widget args
	      Outputs one  or  more  widgets  by  giving  their  configuration
	      options.	 The  -filter  pattern is used as to filter the config
	      options and is interpreted as a case insensitive regexp  pattern
	      (defaults to {.*}).
