NAME
       ipptoolfile - ipptool file format


DESCRIPTION
       The ipptool(1) program accepts free-form plain text files that describe
       one or more IPP requests. Comments start with  the  "#"	character  and
       continue  to  the  end  of the line. Each request is enclosed by curley
       braces, for example:

	   # This is a comment
	   {
	     # The name of the test
	     NAME "Print PostScript Job"

	     # The request to send
	     OPERATION Print-Job
	     GROUP operation-attributes-tag
	     ATTR charset attributes-charset utf-8
	     ATTR language attributes-natural-language en
	     ATTR uri printer-uri $uri
	     ATTR name requesting-user-name $user
	     FILE testfile.ps

	     # The response to expect
	     STATUS successful-ok
	     EXPECT attributes-charset OF-TYPE charset
	     EXPECT attributes-natural-language OF-TYPE naturalLanguage
	     EXPECT job-id OF-TYPE integer
	     EXPECT job-uri OF-TYPE uri
	   }
	   {
	     # The name of the test
	     NAME "Get Attributes of PostScript Job"

	     # The request to send
	     OPERATION Get-Job-Attributes
	     GROUP operation-attributes-tag
	     ATTR charset attributes-charset utf-8
	     ATTR language attributes-natural-language en
	     ATTR uri printer-uri $uri
	     ATTR integer job-id $job-id
	     ATTR name requesting-user-name $user

	     # The response to expect
	     STATUS successful-ok
	     EXPECT attributes-charset OF-TYPE charset
	     EXPECT attributes-natural-language OF-TYPE naturalLanguage
	     EXPECT job-id OF-TYPE integer
	     EXPECT job-uri OF-TYPE uri
	     EXPECT job-state OF-TYPE enum
	     EXPECT job-originating-user-name OF-TYPE name WITH-VALUE "$user"
	   }


TOP-LEVEL DIRECTIVES
       The following directives can be used outside of a test:

       { test }
	    Defines a test.

       DEFINE variable-name value
	    Defines the named variable to the given value. This is  equivalent
	    to	specifying  "-d  variable-name=value"  on the ipptool command-
	    line.

       DEFINE-DEFAULT variable-name value
	    Defines the named variable to the  given  value  if  it  does  not
	    already have a value.

       IGNORE-ERRORS yes

       IGNORE-ERRORS no
	    Specifies whether, by default, ipptool will ignore errors and con-
	    tinue with subsequent tests.

       INCLUDE "filename"

       INCLUDE <filename>
	    Includes another test file. The first form includes a  file  rela-
	    tive  to  the  current test file, while the second form includes a
	    file from the ipptool include directory.

       INCLUDE-IF-DEFINED name "filename"

       INCLUDE-IF-DEFINED name <filename>
	    Includes another test file if the named variable is  defined.  The
	    first  form  includes  a  file  relative to the current test file,
	    while the second form includes a file  from  the  ipptool  include
	    directory.

       INCLUDE-IF-NOT-DEFINED name "filename"

       INCLUDE-IF-NOT-DEFINED name <filename>
	    Includes  another  test file if the named variable is not defined.
	    The first form includes a file relative to the current test  file,
	    while  the	second	form  includes a file from the ipptool include
	    directory.

       SKIP-IF-DEFINED variable-name

       SKIP-IF-NOT-DEFINED variable-name
	    Specifies that the remainder of the test file  should  be  skipped
	    when the variable is or is not defined.

       TRANSFER auto
	    Specifies  that  tests  will,  by default, use "Transfer-Encoding:
	    chunked" for requests with attached  files	and  "Content-Length:"
	    for requests without attached files.

       TRANSFER chunked
	    Specifies that tests will, by default, use the HTTP/1.1 "Transfer-
	    Encoding: chunked" header. This is the default and	is  equivalent
	    to	specifying "-c" on the ipptool command-line. Support for chun-
	    ked requests is required for conformance with all versions of IPP.

       TRANSFER length
	    Specifies  that tests will, by default, use the HTTP/1.0 "Content-
	    Length:" header. This is equivalent to specifying "-l" on the ipp-
	    tool   command-line.   Support  for  content  length  requests  is
	    required for conformance with all versions of IPP.

       VERSION 1.0

       VERSION 1.1

       VERSION 2.0

       VERSION 2.1

       VERSION 2.2
	    Specifies the default IPP version number to use for the tests that
	    follow.


TEST DIRECTIVES
       The following directives are understood in a test:

       ATTR tag attribute-name value(s)
	    Adds an attribute to the test request. Values are separated by the
	    comma (",") character - escape commas using the "

       ATTR collection attribute-name { MEMBER tag member-name value(s) ...  }
       [ ... { ... } ]
	    Adds a collection attribute to the test request. Member attributes
	    follow the same syntax as regular attributes and can themselves be
	    nested collections.  Multiple collection values can be supplied as
	    needed.

       DELAY seconds
	    Specifies a delay before this test will be run.

       DISPLAY attribute-name
	    Specifies  that  value  of the named attribute should be output as
	    part of the test report.

       EXPECT attribute-name [ predicate(s) ]

       EXPECT ?attribute-name predicate(s)

       EXPECT !attribute-name
	    Specifies that the response must/may/must not  include  the  named
	    attribute.	 Additional  requirements can be added as predicates -
	    see the "EXPECT PREDICATES" section for more information on predi-
	    cates.

       FILE filename
	    Specifies  a  file	to  include at the end of the request. This is
	    typically used when sending a test print file.

       GROUP tag
	    Specifies the group tag for subsequent attributes in the  request.

       IGNORE-ERRORS yes

       IGNORE-ERRORS no
	    Specifies  whether	ipptool  will  ignore errors and continue with
	    subsequent tests.

       NAME "literal string"
	    Specifies the human-readable name of the test.

       OPERATION operation-code
	    Specifies the operation to be performed.

       REQUEST-ID number

       REQUEST-ID random
	    Specifies the request-id value to use in the  request,  either  an
	    integer  or  the  word  "random" to use a randomly generated value
	    (the default).

       RESOURCE path
	    Specifies an alternate resource path that is  used	for  the  HTTP
	    POST  request.   The default is the resource from the URI provided
	    to the ipptool program.

       SKIP-IF-DEFINED variable-name

       SKIP-IF-NOT-DEFINED variable-name
	    Specifies that the current test should be skipped when  the  vari-
	    able is or is not defined.

       SKIP-PREVIOUS-ERROR yes

       SKIP-PREVIOUS-ERROR no
	    Specifies whether ipptool will skip the current test if the previ-
	    ous test resulted in an error/failure.

       STATUS status-code [ predicate ]
	    Specifies  an  expected  response  status-code  value.  Additional
	    requirements  can  be added as predicates - see the "STATUS PREDI-
	    CATES" section for more information on predicates.

       TRANSFER auto
	    Specifies that this test will use "Transfer-Encoding: chunked"  if
	    it has an attached file or "Content-Length:" otherwise.

       TRANSFER chunked
	    Specifies that this test will use the HTTP/1.1 "Transfer-Encoding:
	    chunked" header.

       TRANSFER length
	    Specifies that this test will use the  HTTP/1.0  "Content-Length:"
	    header.

       VERSION 1.0

       VERSION 1.1

       VERSION 2.0

       VERSION 2.1

       VERSION 2.2
	    Specifies the IPP version number to use for this test.


EXPECT PREDICATES
       The  following  predicates  are	understood  following  the EXPECT test
       directive:

       COUNT number
	    Requires the EXPECT attribute to have the specified number of val-
	    ues.

       DEFINE-MATCH variable-name
	    Defines  the  variable to "1" when the EXPECT condition matches. A
	    side-effect of this predicate is that this EXPECT will never  fail
	    a test.

       DEFINE-NO-MATCH variable-name
	    Defines  the  variable  to	"1" when the EXPECT condition does not
	    match. A side- effect of this predicate is that this  EXPECT  will
	    never fail a test.

       DEFINE-VALUE variable-name
	    Defines the variable to the value of the attribute when the EXPECT
	    condition matches. A side-effect of this predicate	is  that  this
	    EXPECT will never fail a test.

       IF-DEFINED variable-name
	    Makes  the	EXPECT conditions apply only if the specified variable
	    is defined.

       IF-NOT-DEFINED variable-name
	    Makes the EXPECT conditions apply only if the  specified  variable
	    is not defined.

       IN-GROUP tag
	    Requires the EXPECT attribute to be in the specified group tag.

       OF-TYPE tag[,tag,...]
	    Requires the EXPECT attribute to use the specified value tag(s).

       REPEAT-LIMIT number
	    Specifies the maximum number of times to repeat. The default value
	    is 1000.

       REPEAT-MATCH

       REPEAT-NO-MATCH
	    Specifies that the current test should be repeated when the EXPECT
	    condition matches or does not match.

       SAME-COUNT-AS attribute-name
	    Requires the EXPECT attribute to have the same number of values as
	    the specified parallel attribute.

       WITH-ALL-VALUES "literal string"
	    Requires that all values of the EXPECT attribute match the literal
	    string. Comparisons are case-sensitive.

       WITH-ALL-VALUES <number

       WITH-ALL-VALUES =number

       WITH-ALL-VALUES >number

       WITH-ALL-VALUES number[,number,...]
	    Requires  that  all  values of the EXPECT attribute match the num-
	    ber(s) or numeric comparison. When comparing  rangeOfInteger  val-
	    ues,  the  "<" and ">" operators only check the upper bound of the
	    range.

       WITH-ALL-VALUES "false"

       WITH-ALL-VALUES "true"
	    Requires that all values of the EXPECT attribute match the boolean
	    value given.

       WITH-ALL-VALUES "/regular expression/"
	    Requires that all values of the EXPECT attribute match the regular
	    expression, which must conform to  the  POSIX  regular  expression
	    syntax. Comparisons are case-sensitive.

       WITH-VALUE "literal string"
	    Requires  that  at least one value of the EXPECT attribute matches
	    the literal string. Comparisons are case-sensitive.

       WITH-VALUE <number

       WITH-VALUE =number

       WITH-VALUE >number

       WITH-VALUE number[,number,...]
	    Requires that at least one value of the EXPECT  attribute  matches
	    the number(s) or numeric comparison. When comparing rangeOfInteger
	    values, the "<" and ">" operators only check the  upper  bound  of
	    the range.

       WITH-VALUE "false"

       WITH-VALUE "true"
	    Requires  that  at least one value of the EXPECT attribute matches
	    the boolean value given.

       WITH-VALUE "/regular expression/"
	    Requires that at least one value of the EXPECT  attribute  matches
	    the  regular  expression,  which must conform to the POSIX regular
	    expression syntax. Comparisons are case-sensitive.


STATUS PREDICATES
       The following predicates  are  understood  following  the  STATUS  test
       directive:

       IF-DEFINED variable-name
	    Makes  the STATUS apply only if the specified variable is defined.

       IF-NOT-DEFINED variable-name
	    Makes the STATUS apply only  if  the  specified  variable  is  not
	    defined.

       REPEAT-LIMIT number
	    Specifies the maximum number of times to repeat. The default value
	    is 1000.

       REPEAT-MATCH

       REPEAT-NO-MATCH
	    Specifies that the	current  test  should  be  repeated  when  the
	    response status-code matches or does not match the value specified
	    by the STATUS directive.
