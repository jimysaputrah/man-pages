POSIX_SPAWNATTR_SETPG... BSD Library Functions Manual POSIX_SPAWNATTR_SETPG...

NAME
     posix_spawnattr_setpgroup posix_spawnattr_getpgroup -- set or get the
     spawn-pgroup attribute on a posix_spawnattr_t

SYNOPSIS
     #include &ltspawn.h&gt

     int
     posix_spawnattr_setpgroup(posix_spawnattr_t *attr, pid_t pgroup);

     int
     posix_spawnattr_getpgroup(const posix_spawnattr_t *restrict attr,
	 pid_t *restrict pgroup);

DESCRIPTION
     The posix_spawnattr_setpgroup() function sets the pgroup on the
     attributes object referenced by attr.

     The posix_spawnattr_getpgroup() function retrieves the pgroup on the
     attributes object referenced by attr.

     The argument pgroup is the process group to be joined or created when the
     new process is created if the POSIX_SPAWN_SETPGROUP flag is set in the
     posix_spawnattr_t via a call to posix_spawnattr_setflags(3); its default
     value is 0, which means a new process group will be created.

RETURN VALUES
     On success, these functions return 0; on failure they return an error
     number from &lterrno.h&gt.  Additionally, if successful,
     posix_spawnattr_getpgroup() will modify the contents of the pgroup param-
     eter with the current attribute value.

ERRORS
     These functions may fail if:

     [EINVAL]		The value specified by attr is invalid.

     [EINVAL]		The value of attr is invalid.
