NAME
       glNewList, glEndList - create or replace a display list


C SPECIFICATION
       void glNewList( GLuint list,
		       GLenum mode )


PARAMETERS
       list  Specifies the display-list name.

       mode  Specifies	the  compilation  mode,  which	can  be  GL_COMPILE or
	     GL_COMPILE_AND_EXECUTE.

C SPECIFICATION
       void glEndList( void )


DESCRIPTION
       Display lists are groups of GL commands that have been stored for  sub-
       sequent execution.  Display lists are created with glNewList.  All sub-
       sequent commands are placed in the display list, in the	order  issued,
       until glEndList is called.

       glNewList  has  two arguments.  The first argument, list, is a positive
       integer that becomes the unique name for the display list.   Names  can
       be  created and reserved with glGenLists and tested for uniqueness with
       glIsList.  The second argument, mode, is a symbolic constant  that  can
       assume one of two values:

       GL_COMPILE		     Commands are merely compiled.

       GL_COMPILE_AND_EXECUTE	     Commands  are  executed  as they are com-
				     piled into the display list.

       Certain commands are not compiled into the display list	but  are  exe-
       cuted immediately, regardless of the display-list mode.	These commands
       are     glAreTexturesResident,	   glColorPointer,	glDeleteLists,
       glDeleteTextures,	glDisableClientState,	    glEdgeFlagPointer,
       glEnableClientState, glFeedbackBuffer, glFinish,  glFlush,  glGenLists,
       glGenTextures,	 glIndexPointer,   glInterleavedArrays,   glIsEnabled,
       glIsList,     glIsTexture,     glNormalPointer,	    glPopClientAttrib,
       glPixelStore,	 glPushClientAttrib,	glReadPixels,	 glRenderMode,
       glSelectBuffer, glTexCoordPointer,  glVertexPointer,  and  all  of  the
       glGet commands.

       Similarly,  glTexImage1D,  glTexImage2D,  and glTexImage3D are executed
       immediately and not compiled into the display  list  when  their  first
       argument     is	   GL_PROXY_TEXTURE_1D,     GL_PROXY_TEXTURE_1D,    or
       GL_PROXY_TEXTURE_3D, respectively.

       When the GL_ARB_imaging extension is  supported,  glHistogram  executes
       immediately   when  its	argument  is  GL_PROXY_HISTOGRAM.   Similarly,
       glColorTable  executes  immediately  when   its	 first	 argument   is
       glPROXY_COLOR_TABLE,	 glPROXY_POST_CONVOLUTION_COLOR_TABLE,	    or
       glPROXY_POST_COLOR_MATRIX_COLOR_TABLE.

       When    the     GL_ARB_multitexture     extension     is     supported,
       glClientActiveTextureARB  is  not compiled into display lists, but exe-
       cuted immediately.

       When glEndList is encountered, the display-list definition is completed
       by  associating	the  list  with the unique name list (specified in the
       glNewList command).  If a display list with name list  already  exists,
       it is replaced only when glEndList is called.

NOTES
       glCallList and glCallLists can be entered into display lists.  Commands
       in the display list or lists executed by glCallList or glCallLists  are
       not  included  in the display list being created, even if the list cre-
       ation mode is GL_COMPILE_AND_EXECUTE.

       A display list is just a group of commands  and	arguments,  so	errors
       generated by commands in a display list must be generated when the list
       is executed. If the list is created in GL_COMPILE mode, errors are  not
       generated until the list is executed.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if list is 0.

       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if mode is not an accepted value.

       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if glEndList is called without a pre-
       ceding glNewList, or if glNewList is called while  a  display  list  is
       being defined.

       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if glNewList or glEndList is executed
       between the execution of glBegin and  the  corresponding  execution  of
       glEnd.

       GL_OUT_OF_MEMORY  is  generated if there is insufficient memory to com-
       pile the display list. If the GL version is 1.1 or greater,  no	change
       is  made  to  the previous contents of the display list, if any, and no
       other change is made to the GL state. (It is as if no attempt had  been
       made to create the new display list.)

ASSOCIATED GETS
       glIsList
       glGet with argument GL_LIST_INDEX
       glGet with argument GL_LIST_MODE
