NAME
       Tk_GetDash - convert from string to valid dash structure.

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lttk.h&gt

       int
       Tk_GetDash(interp, string, dashPtr)

ARGUMENTS
       Tcl_Interp *interp (in)	      Interpreter  to use for error reporting.

       const char * string (in)       Textual value to be converted.

       Tk_Dash *dashPtr (out)	      Points to place to store the  dash  pat-

DESCRIPTION
       These  procedure  parses  the  string  and  fills  in the result in the
       Tk_Dash structure. The string can be a list of integers or a  character
       string  containing  only  ".,-_" or spaces. If all goes well, TCL_OK is
       returned. If string does not have the proper syntax then  TCL_ERROR  is
       returned,  an  error  message  is left in the interpreter's result, and
       nothing is stored at *dashPtr.

       The first possible syntax is a list of integers.  Each  element	repre-
       sents the number of pixels of a line segment. Only the odd segments are
       drawn using the "outline" color. The other segments are drawn transpar-
       ent.

       The second possible syntax is a character list containing only 5 possi-
       ble characters ".,-_ ".	The space can be used  to  enlarge  the  space
       between other line elements, and can not occur as the first position in
       the string. Some examples:
		  -dash .     = -dash {2 4}
		  -dash -     = -dash {6 4}
		  -dash -.    = -dash {6 4 2 4}
		  -dash -..   = -dash {6 4 2 4 2 4}
		  -dash {. }  = -dash {2 8}
		  -dash ,     = -dash {4 4}

       The main difference of this syntax with the  previous  is  that	it  is
       shape-conserving.  This	means that all values in the dash list will be
       multiplied by the line width before  display.  This  assures  that  "."
       will  always  be displayed as a dot and "-" always as a dash regardless
       of the line width.

       On systems where only a limited set of dash patterns, the dash  pattern
       will be displayed as the most close dash pattern that is available. For
       example, on Windows only the first 4 of the above examples  are	avail-
       able.  The  last  2 examples will be displayed identically as the first
       one.
