NAME
       glBindBuffer - bind a named buffer object

C SPECIFICATION
       void glBindBuffer(GLenum target, GLuint buffer);

PARAMETERS
       target
	   Specifies the target to which the buffer object is bound. The
	   symbolic constant must be GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, GL_COPY_READ_BUFFER,
	   GL_COPY_WRITE_BUFFER, GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER,
	   GL_PIXEL_PACK_BUFFER, GL_PIXEL_UNPACK_BUFFER, GL_TEXTURE_BUFFER,
	   GL_TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_BUFFER, or GL_UNIFORM_BUFFER.

       buffer
	   Specifies the name of a buffer object.

DESCRIPTION
       glBindBuffer binds a buffer object to the specified buffer binding
       point. Calling glBindBuffer with target set to one of the accepted
       symbolic constants and buffer set to the name of a buffer object binds
       that buffer object name to the target. If no buffer object with name
       buffer exists, one is created with that name. When a buffer object is
       bound to a target, the previous binding for that target is
       automatically broken.

       Buffer object names are unsigned integers. The value zero is reserved,
       but there is no default buffer object for each buffer object target.
       Instead, buffer set to zero effectively unbinds any buffer object
       previously bound, and restores client memory usage for that buffer
       object target (if supported for that target). Buffer object names and
       the corresponding buffer object contents are local to the shared object
       space of the current GL rendering context; two rendering contexts share
       buffer object names only if they explicitly enable sharing between
       contexts through the appropriate GL windows interfaces functions.


       glGenBuffers() must be used to generate a set of unused buffer object
       names.

       The state of a buffer object immediately after it is first bound is an
       unmapped zero-sized memory buffer with GL_READ_WRITE access and
       GL_STATIC_DRAW usage.

       While a non-zero buffer object name is bound, GL operations on the
       target to which it is bound affect the bound buffer object, and queries
       of the target to which it is bound return state from the bound buffer
       object. While buffer object name zero is bound, as in the initial
       state, attempts to modify or query state on the target to which it is
       bound generates an GL_INVALID_OPERATION error.

       When a non-zero buffer object is bound to the GL_ARRAY_BUFFER target,
       the vertex array pointer parameter is interpreted as an offset within
       the buffer object measured in basic machine units.

       While a non-zero buffer object is bound to the GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER
       target, the indices parameter of glDrawElements(),
       glDrawElementsInstanced(), glDrawElementsBaseVertex(),
       glDrawRangeElements(), glDrawRangeElementsBaseVertex(),
       glMultiDrawElements(), or glMultiDrawElementsBaseVertex() is
       interpreted as an offset within the buffer object measured in basic
       machine units.

       While a non-zero buffer object is bound to the GL_PIXEL_PACK_BUFFER
       target, the following commands are affected: glGetCompressedTexImage(),
       glGetTexImage(), and glReadPixels(). The pointer parameter is
       interpreted as an offset within the buffer object measured in basic
       machine units.

       While a non-zero buffer object is bound to the GL_PIXEL_UNPACK_BUFFER
       target, the following commands are affected: glCompressedTexImage1D(),
       glCompressedTexImage2D(), glCompressedTexImage3D(),
       glCompressedTexSubImage1D(), glCompressedTexSubImage2D(),
       glCompressedTexSubImage3D(), glTexImage1D(), glTexImage2D(),
       glTexImage3D(), glTexSubImage1D(), glTexSubImage2D(), and
       glTexSubImage3D(). The pointer parameter is interpreted as an offset
       within the buffer object measured in basic machine units.

       The buffer targets GL_COPY_READ_BUFFER and GL_COPY_WRITE_BUFFER are
       provided to allow glCopyBufferSubData() to be used without disturbing
       the state of other bindings. However, glCopyBufferSubData() may be used
       with any pair of buffer binding points.

       The GL_TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_BUFFER buffer binding point may be passed to
       glBindBuffer, but will not directly affect transform feedback state.
       Instead, the indexed GL_TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_BUFFER bindings must be used
       through a call to glBindBufferBase() or glBindBufferRange(). This will
       affect the generic GL_TRANSFORM_FEEDABCK_BUFFER binding.

       Likewise, the GL_UNIFORM_BUFFER buffer binding point may be used, but
       does not directly affect uniform buffer state.  glBindBufferBase() or
       glBindBufferRange() must be used to bind a buffer to an indexed uniform
       buffer binding point.

       A buffer object binding created with glBindBuffer remains active until
       a different buffer object name is bound to the same target, or until
       the bound buffer object is deleted with glDeleteBuffers().

       Once created, a named buffer object may be re-bound to any target as
       often as needed. However, the GL implementation may make choices about
       how to optimize the storage of a buffer object based on its initial
       binding target.

NOTES
       The GL_COPY_READ_BUFFER, GL_UNIFORM_BUFFER and GL_TEXTURE_BUFFER
       targets are available only if the GL version is 3.1 or greater.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if target is not one of the allowable
       values.


       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if buffer is not a name previously
       returned from a call to glGenBuffers().
