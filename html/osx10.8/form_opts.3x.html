NAME
       form_opts - set and get form options

SYNOPSIS
       #include <form.h>
       int set_form_opts(FORM *form, Field_Options opts);
       int form_opts_on(FORM *form, Field_Options opts);
       int form_opts_off(FORM *form, Field_Options opts);
       Field_Options form_opts(const FORM *form);

DESCRIPTION
       The  function set_form_opts sets all the given form's option bits (form
       option bits may be logically-OR'ed together).

       The function form_opts_on turns on the given option  bits,  and	leaves
       others alone.

       The  function form_opts_off turns off the given option bits, and leaves
       others alone.

       The function form_opts returns the form's current option bits.

       The following options are defined (all are on by default):

       O_NL_OVERLOAD
	    Overload the REQ_NEW_LINE forms driver request so that calling  it
	    at the end of a field goes to the next field.

       O_BS_OVERLOAD
	    Overload  the REQ_DEL_PREV forms driver request so that calling it
	    at the beginning of a field goes to the previous field.

RETURN VALUE
       Except for form_opts, each routine returns one of the following:

       E_OK The routine succeeded.

       E_SYSTEM_ERROR
	    System error occurred (see errno).

SEE ALSO
       curses(3X), form(3X).

NOTES
       The  header  file  <form.h>  automatically  includes  the  header  file
       <curses.h>.

PORTABILITY
       These  routines emulate the System V forms library.  They were not sup-
       ported on Version 7 or BSD versions.
