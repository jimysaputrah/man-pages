NAME
       glAttachShader - Attaches a shader object to a program object

C SPECIFICATION
       void glAttachShader(GLuint program, GLuint shader);

PARAMETERS
       program
	   Specifies the program object to which a shader object will be
	   attached.

       shader
	   Specifies the shader object that is to be attached.

DESCRIPTION
       In order to create a complete shader program, there must be a way to
       specify the list of things that will be linked together. Program
       objects provide this mechanism. Shaders that are to be linked together
       in a program object must first be attached to that program object.
       glAttachShader attaches the shader object specified by shader to the
       program object specified by program. This indicates that shader will be
       included in link operations that will be performed on program.

       All operations that can be performed on a shader object are valid
       whether or not the shader object is attached to a program object. It is
       permissible to attach a shader object to a program object before source
       code has been loaded into the shader object or before the shader object
       has been compiled. It is permissible to attach multiple shader objects
       of the same type because each may contain a portion of the complete
       shader. It is also permissible to attach a shader object to more than
       one program object. If a shader object is deleted while it is attached
       to a program object, it will be flagged for deletion, and deletion will
       not occur until glDetachShader() is called to detach it from all
       program objects to which it is attached.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if either program or shader is not a
       value generated by OpenGL.

       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if program is not a program object.

       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if shader is not a shader object.

       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if shader is already attached to
       program.
