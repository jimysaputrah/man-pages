DESCRIPTION
       This module implements the "URI" class.	Objects of this class
       represent "Uniform Resource Identifier references" as specified in RFC
       2396 (and updated by RFC 2732).

       A Uniform Resource Identifier is a compact string of characters that
       identifies an abstract or physical resource.  A Uniform Resource
       Identifier can be further classified as either a Uniform Resource
       Locator (URL) or a Uniform Resource Name (URN).	The distinction
       between URL and URN does not matter to the "URI" class interface. A
       "URI-reference" is a URI that may have additional information attached
       in the form of a fragment identifier.

       An absolute URI reference consists of three parts:  a scheme, a scheme-
       specific part and a fragment identifier.  A subset of URI references
       share a common syntax for hierarchical namespaces.  For these, the
       scheme-specific part is further broken down into authority, path and
       query components.  These URIs can also take the form of relative URI
       references, where the scheme (and usually also the authority) component
       is missing, but implied by the context of the URI reference.  The three
       forms of URI reference syntax are summarized as follows:

	 &ltscheme&gt:&ltscheme-specific-part&gt#&ltfragment&gt
	 &ltscheme&gt://&ltauthority&gt&ltpath&gt?&ltquery&gt#&ltfragment&gt
	 &ltpath&gt?&ltquery&gt#&ltfragment&gt

       The components into which a URI reference can be divided depend on the
       scheme.	The "URI" class provides methods to get and set the individual
       components.  The methods available for a specific "URI" object depend
       on the scheme.

CONSTRUCTORS
       The following methods construct new "URI" objects:

       $uri = URI-&gtnew( $str )
       $uri = URI-&gtnew( $str, $scheme )
	   Constructs a new URI object.  The string representation of a URI is
	   given as argument, together with an optional scheme specification.
	   Common URI wrappers like "" and &lt&gt, as well as leading and trailing
	   white space, are automatically removed from the $str argument
	   before it is processed further.

	   The constructor determines the scheme, maps this to an appropriate
	   URI subclass, constructs a new object of that class and returns it.

	   The $scheme argument is only used when $str is a relative URI.  It
	   can be either a simple string that denotes the scheme, a string
	   containing an absolute URI reference, or an absolute "URI" object.
	   If no $scheme is specified for a relative URI $str, then $str is
	   simply treated as a generic URI (no scheme-specific methods
	   available).

	   The set of characters available for building URI references is
	   restricted (see URI::Escape).  Characters outside this set are
	   automatically escaped by the URI constructor.

       $uri = URI-&gtnew_abs( $str, $base_uri )
	   Constructs a new absolute URI object.  The $str argument can denote
	   a relative or absolute URI.	If relative, then it is absolutized
	   using $base_uri as base. The $base_uri must be an absolute URI.

       $uri = URI::file-&gtnew( $filename )
       $uri = URI::file-&gtnew( $filename, $os )
	   Constructs a new file URI from a file name.	See URI::file.

       $uri = URI::file-&gtnew_abs( $filename )
       $uri = URI::file-&gtnew_abs( $filename, $os )
	   Constructs a new absolute file URI from a file name.  See
	   URI::file.

       $uri = URI::file-&gtcwd
	   Returns the current working directory as a file URI.  See
	   URI::file.

       $uri-&gtclone
	   Returns a copy of the $uri.

COMMON METHODS
       The methods described in this section are available for all "URI"
       objects.

       Methods that give access to components of a URI always return the old
       value of the component.	The value returned is "undef" if the component
       was not present.  There is generally a difference between a component
       that is empty (represented as "") and a component that is missing
       (represented as "undef").  If an accessor method is given an argument,
       it updates the corresponding component in addition to returning the old
       value of the component.	Passing an undefined argument removes the
       component (if possible).  The description of each accessor method
       indicates whether the component is passed as an escaped (percent-
       encoded) or an unescaped string.  A component that can be further
       divided into sub-parts are usually passed escaped, as unescaping might
       change its semantics.

       The common methods available for all URI are:

       $uri-&gtscheme
       $uri-&gtscheme( $new_scheme )
	   Sets and returns the scheme part of the $uri.  If the $uri is
	   relative, then $uri-&gtscheme returns "undef".  If called with an
	   argument, it updates the scheme of $uri, possibly changing the
	   class of $uri, and returns the old scheme value.  The method croaks
	   if the new scheme name is illegal; a scheme name must begin with a
	   letter and must consist of only US-ASCII letters, numbers, and a
	   few special marks: ".", "+", "-".  This restriction effectively
	   means that the scheme must be passed unescaped.  Passing an
	   undefined argument to the scheme method makes the URI relative (if
	   possible).

	   Letter case does not matter for scheme names.  The string returned
	   by $uri-&gtscheme is always lowercase.  If you want the scheme just
	   as it was written in the URI in its original case, you can use the
	   $uri-&gt_scheme method instead.

       $uri-&gtopaque
       $uri-&gtopaque( $new_opaque )
	   Sets and returns the scheme-specific part of the $uri (everything
	   between the scheme and the fragment) as an escaped string.

       $uri-&gtpath
       $uri-&gtpath( $new_path )
	   Sets and returns the same value as $uri-&gtopaque unless the URI
	   supports the generic syntax for hierarchical namespaces.  In that
	   case the generic method is overridden to set and return the part of
	   the URI between the host name and the fragment.

       $uri-&gtfragment
       $uri-&gtfragment( $new_frag )
	   Returns the fragment identifier of a URI reference as an escaped
	   string.

       $uri-&gtas_string
	   Returns a URI object to a plain ASCII string.  URI objects are also
	   converted to plain strings automatically by overloading.  This
	   means that $uri objects can be used as plain strings in most Perl
	   constructs.

       $uri-&gtas_iri
	   Returns a Unicode string representing the URI.  Escaped UTF-8
	   sequences representing non-ASCII characters are turned into their
	   corresponding Unicode code point.

       $uri-&gtcanonical
	   Returns a normalized version of the URI.  The rules for
	   normalization are scheme-dependent.	They usually involve
	   lowercasing the scheme and Internet host name components, removing
	   the explicit port specification if it matches the default port,
	   uppercasing all escape sequences, and unescaping octets that can be
	   better represented as plain characters.

	   For efficiency reasons, if the $uri is already in normalized form,
	   then a reference to it is returned instead of a copy.

       $uri-&gteq( $other_uri )
       URI::eq( $first_uri, $other_uri )
	   Tests whether two URI references are equal.	URI references that
	   normalize to the same string are considered equal.  The method can
	   also be used as a plain function which can also test two string
	   arguments.

	   If you need to test whether two "URI" object references denote the
	   same object, use the '==' operator.

       $uri-&gtabs( $base_uri )
	   Returns an absolute URI reference.  If $uri is already absolute,
	   then a reference to it is simply returned.  If the $uri is
	   relative, then a new absolute URI is constructed by combining the
	   $uri and the $base_uri, and returned.

       $uri-&gtrel( $base_uri )
	   Returns a relative URI reference if it is possible to make one that
	   denotes the same resource relative to $base_uri.  If not, then $uri
	   is simply returned.

       $uri-&gtsecure
	   Returns a TRUE value if the URI is considered to point to a
	   resource on a secure channel, such as an SSL or TLS encrypted one.

GENERIC METHODS
       The following methods are available to schemes that use the
       common/generic syntax for hierarchical namespaces.  The descriptions of
       schemes below indicate which these are.	Unknown schemes are assumed to
       support the generic syntax, and therefore the following methods:

       $uri-&gtauthority
       $uri-&gtauthority( $new_authority )
	   Sets and returns the escaped authority component of the $uri.

       $uri-&gtpath
       $uri-&gtpath( $new_path )
	   Sets and returns the escaped path component of the $uri (the part
	   between the host name and the query or fragment).  The path can
	   never be undefined, but it can be the empty string.

       $uri-&gtpath_query
       $uri-&gtpath_query( $new_path_query )
	   Sets and returns the escaped path and query components as a single
	   entity.  The path and the query are separated by a "?" character,
	   but the query can itself contain "?".

       $uri-&gtpath_segments
       $uri-&gtpath_segments( $segment, ... )
	   Sets and returns the path.  In a scalar context, it returns the
	   same value as $uri-&gtpath.  In a list context, it returns the
	   unescaped path segments that make up the path.  Path segments that
	   have parameters are returned as an anonymous array.	The first
	   element is the unescaped path segment proper;  subsequent elements
	   are escaped parameter strings.  Such an anonymous array uses
	   overloading so it can be treated as a string too, but this string
	   does not include the parameters.

	   Note that absolute paths have the empty string as their first
	   path_segment, i.e. the path "/foo/bar" have 3 path_segments; "",
	   "foo" and "bar".

       $uri-&gtquery
       $uri-&gtquery( $new_query )
	   Sets and returns the escaped query component of the $uri.

       $uri-&gtquery_form
       $uri-&gtquery_form( $key1 =&gt $val1, $key2 =&gt $val2, ... )
       $uri-&gtquery_form( $key1 =&gt $val1, $key2 =&gt $val2, ..., $delim )
       $uri-&gtquery_form( \@key_value_pairs )
       $uri-&gtquery_form( \@key_value_pairs, $delim )
       $uri-&gtquery_form( \%hash )
       $uri-&gtquery_form( \%hash, $delim )
	   Sets and returns query components that use the
	   application/x-www-form-urlencoded format.  Key/value pairs are
	   separated by "&", and the key is separated from the value by a "="
	   character.

	   The form can be set either by passing separate key/value pairs, or
	   via an array or hash reference.  Passing an empty array or an empty
	   hash removes the query component, whereas passing no arguments at
	   all leaves the component unchanged.	The order of keys is undefined
	   if a hash reference is passed.  The old value is always returned as
	   a list of separate key/value pairs.	Assigning this list to a hash
	   is unwise as the keys returned might repeat.

	   The values passed when setting the form can be plain strings or
	   references to arrays of strings.  Passing an array of values has
	   the same effect as passing the key repeatedly with one value at a
	   time.  All the following statements have the same effect:

	       $uri-&gtquery_form(foo =&gt 1, foo =&gt 2);
	       $uri-&gtquery_form(foo =&gt [1, 2]);
	       $uri-&gtquery_form([ foo =&gt 1, foo =&gt 2 ]);
	       $uri-&gtquery_form([ foo =&gt [1, 2] ]);
	       $uri-&gtquery_form({ foo =&gt [1, 2] });

	   The $delim parameter can be passed as ";" to force the key/value
	   pairs to be delimited by ";" instead of "&" in the query string.
	   This practice is often recommended for URLs embedded in HTML or XML
	   documents as this avoids the trouble of escaping the "&" character.
	   You might also set the $URI::DEFAULT_QUERY_FORM_DELIMITER variable
	   to ";" for the same global effect.

	   The "URI::QueryParam" module can be loaded to add further methods
	   to manipulate the form of a URI.  See URI::QueryParam for details.

       $uri-&gtquery_keywords
       $uri-&gtquery_keywords( $keywords, ... )
       $uri-&gtquery_keywords( \@keywords )
	   Sets and returns query components that use the keywords separated
	   by "+" format.

	   The keywords can be set either by passing separate keywords
	   directly or by passing a reference to an array of keywords.
	   Passing an empty array removes the query component, whereas passing
	   no arguments at all leaves the component unchanged.	The old value
	   is always returned as a list of separate words.

SERVER METHODS
       For schemes where the authority component denotes an Internet host, the
       following methods are available in addition to the generic methods.

       $uri-&gtuserinfo
       $uri-&gtuserinfo( $new_userinfo )
	   Sets and returns the escaped userinfo part of the authority
	   component.

	   For some schemes this is a user name and a password separated by a
	   colon.  This practice is not recommended. Embedding passwords in
	   clear text (such as URI) has proven to be a security risk in almost
	   every case where it has been used.

       $uri-&gthost
       $uri-&gthost( $new_host )
	   Sets and returns the unescaped hostname.

	   If the $new_host string ends with a colon and a number, then this
	   number also sets the port.

	   For IPv6 addresses the brackets around the raw address is removed
	   in the return value from $uri-&gthost.  When setting the host
	   attribute to an IPv6 address you can use a raw address or one
	   enclosed in brackets.  The address needs to be enclosed in brackets
	   if you want to pass in a new port value as well.

       $uri-&gtihost
	   Returns the host in Unicode form.  Any IDNA A-labels are turned
	   into U-labels.

       $uri-&gtport
       $uri-&gtport( $new_port )
	   Sets and returns the port.  The port is a simple integer that
	   should be greater than 0.

	   If a port is not specified explicitly in the URI, then the URI
	   scheme's default port is returned. If you don't want the default
	   port substituted, then you can use the $uri-&gt_port method instead.

       $uri-&gthost_port
       $uri-&gthost_port( $new_host_port )
	   Sets and returns the host and port as a single unit.  The returned
	   value includes a port, even if it matches the default port.	The
	   host part and the port part are separated by a colon: ":".

	   For IPv6 addresses the bracketing is preserved; thus
	   URI-&gtnew("http://[::1]/")-&gthost_port returns "[::1]:80".  Contrast
	   this with $uri-&gthost which will remove the brackets.

       $uri-&gtdefault_port
	   Returns the default port of the URI scheme to which $uri belongs.
	   For http this is the number 80, for ftp this is the number 21, etc.
	   The default port for a scheme can not be changed.

SCHEME-SPECIFIC SUPPORT
       Scheme-specific support is provided for the following URI schemes.  For
       "URI" objects that do not belong to one of these, you can only use the
       common and generic methods.

       data:
	   The data URI scheme is specified in RFC 2397.  It allows inclusion
	   of small data items as "immediate" data, as if it had been included
	   externally.

	   "URI" objects belonging to the data scheme support the common
	   methods and two new methods to access their scheme-specific
	   components: $uri-&gtmedia_type and $uri-&gtdata.  See URI::data for
	   details.

       file:
	   An old specification of the file URI scheme is found in RFC 1738.
	   A new RFC 2396 based specification in not available yet, but file
	   URI references are in common use.

	   "URI" objects belonging to the file scheme support the common and
	   generic methods.  In addition, they provide two methods for mapping
	   file URIs back to local file names; $uri-&gtfile and $uri-&gtdir.  See
	   URI::file for details.

       ftp:
	   An old specification of the ftp URI scheme is found in RFC 1738.  A
	   new RFC 2396 based specification in not available yet, but ftp URI
	   references are in common use.

	   "URI" objects belonging to the ftp scheme support the common,
	   generic and server methods.	In addition, they provide two methods
	   for accessing the userinfo sub-components: $uri-&gtuser and
	   $uri-&gtpassword.

       gopher:
	   The gopher URI scheme is specified in
	   &ltdraft-murali-url-gopher-1996-12-04&gt and will hopefully be
	   available as a RFC 2396 based specification.

	   "URI" objects belonging to the gopher scheme support the common,
	   generic and server methods. In addition, they support some methods
	   for accessing gopher-specific path components: $uri-&gtgopher_type,
	   $uri-&gtselector, $uri-&gtsearch, $uri-&gtstring.

       http:
	   The http URI scheme is specified in RFC 2616.  The scheme is used
	   to reference resources hosted by HTTP servers.

	   "URI" objects belonging to the http scheme support the common,
	   generic and server methods.

       https:
	   The https URI scheme is a Netscape invention which is commonly
	   implemented.  The scheme is used to reference HTTP servers through
	   SSL connections.  Its syntax is the same as http, but the default
	   port is different.

       ldap:
	   The ldap URI scheme is specified in RFC 2255.  LDAP is the
	   Lightweight Directory Access Protocol.  An ldap URI describes an
	   LDAP search operation to perform to retrieve information from an
	   LDAP directory.

	   "URI" objects belonging to the ldap scheme support the common,
	   generic and server methods as well as ldap-specific methods:
	   $uri-&gtdn, $uri-&gtattributes, $uri-&gtscope, $uri-&gtfilter,
	   $uri-&gtextensions.  See URI::ldap for details.

       ldapi:
	   Like the ldap URI scheme, but uses a UNIX domain socket.  The
	   server methods are not supported, and the local socket path is
	   available as $uri-&gtun_path.	The ldapi scheme is used by the
	   OpenLDAP package.  There is no real specification for it, but it is
	   mentioned in various OpenLDAP manual pages.

       ldaps:
	   Like the ldap URI scheme, but uses an SSL connection.  This scheme
	   is deprecated, as the preferred way is to use the start_tls
	   mechanism.

       mailto:
	   The mailto URI scheme is specified in RFC 2368.  The scheme was
	   originally used to designate the Internet mailing address of an
	   individual or service.  It has (in RFC 2368) been extended to allow
	   setting of other mail header fields and the message body.

	   "URI" objects belonging to the mailto scheme support the common
	   methods and the generic query methods.  In addition, they support
	   the following mailto-specific methods: $uri-&gtto, $uri-&gtheaders.

	   Note that the "foo@example.com" part of a mailto is not the
	   "userinfo" and "host" but instead the "path".  This allows a mailto
	   URI to contain multiple comma separated email addresses.

       mms:
	   The mms URL specification can be found at &lthttp://sdp.ppona.com/&gt.
	   "URI" objects belonging to the mms scheme support the common,
	   generic, and server methods, with the exception of userinfo and
	   query-related sub-components.

       news:
	   The news, nntp and snews URI schemes are specified in
	   &ltdraft-gilman-news-url-01&gt and will hopefully be available as an
	   RFC 2396 based specification soon.

	   "URI" objects belonging to the news scheme support the common,
	   generic and server methods.	In addition, they provide some methods
	   to access the path: $uri-&gtgroup and $uri-&gtmessage.

       nntp:
	   See news scheme.

       pop:
	   The pop URI scheme is specified in RFC 2384. The scheme is used to
	   reference a POP3 mailbox.

	   "URI" objects belonging to the pop scheme support the common,
	   generic and server methods.	In addition, they provide two methods
	   to access the userinfo components: $uri-&gtuser and $uri-&gtauth

       rlogin:
	   An old specification of the rlogin URI scheme is found in RFC 1738.
	   "URI" objects belonging to the rlogin scheme support the common,
	   generic and server methods.

       rtsp:
	   The rtsp URL specification can be found in section 3.2 of RFC 2326.
	   "URI" objects belonging to the rtsp scheme support the common,
	   generic, and server methods, with the exception of userinfo and
	   query-related sub-components.

       rtspu:
	   The rtspu URI scheme is used to talk to RTSP servers over UDP
	   instead of TCP.  The syntax is the same as rtsp.

       rsync:
	   Information about rsync is available from
	   &lthttp://rsync.samba.org/&gt.  "URI" objects belonging to the rsync
	   scheme support the common, generic and server methods.  In
	   addition, they provide methods to access the userinfo sub-
	   components: $uri-&gtuser and $uri-&gtpassword.

       sip:
	   The sip URI specification is described in sections 19.1 and 25 of
	   RFC 3261.  "URI" objects belonging to the sip scheme support the
	   common, generic, and server methods with the exception of path
	   related sub-components.  In addition, they provide two methods to
	   get and set sip parameters: $uri-&gtparams_form and $uri-&gtparams.

       sips:
	   See sip scheme.  Its syntax is the same as sip, but the default
	   port is different.

       snews:
	   See news scheme.  Its syntax is the same as news, but the default
	   port is different.

       telnet:
	   An old specification of the telnet URI scheme is found in RFC 1738.
	   "URI" objects belonging to the telnet scheme support the common,
	   generic and server methods.

       tn3270:
	   These URIs are used like telnet URIs but for connections to IBM
	   mainframes.	"URI" objects belonging to the tn3270 scheme support
	   the common, generic and server methods.

       ssh:
	   Information about ssh is available at &lthttp://www.openssh.com/&gt.
	   "URI" objects belonging to the ssh scheme support the common,
	   generic and server methods. In addition, they provide methods to
	   access the userinfo sub-components: $uri-&gtuser and $uri-&gtpassword.

       urn:
	   The syntax of Uniform Resource Names is specified in RFC 2141.
	   "URI" objects belonging to the urn scheme provide the common
	   methods, and also the methods $uri-&gtnid and $uri-&gtnss, which return
	   the Namespace Identifier and the Namespace-Specific String
	   respectively.

	   The Namespace Identifier basically works like the Scheme identifier
	   of URIs, and further divides the URN namespace.  Namespace
	   Identifier assignments are maintained at
	   http://www.iana.org/assignments/urn-namespaces

	   Letter case is not significant for the Namespace Identifier.  It is
	   always returned in lower case by the $uri-&gtnid method.  The
	   $uri-&gt_nid method can be used if you want it in its original case.

       urn:isbn:
	   The "urn:isbn:" namespace contains International Standard Book
	   Numbers (ISBNs) and is described in RFC 3187.  A "URI" object
	   belonging to this namespace has the following extra methods (if the
	   Business::ISBN module is available): $uri-&gtisbn,
	   $uri-&gtisbn_publisher_code, $uri-&gtisbn_group_code (formerly
	   isbn_country_code, which is still supported by issues a deprecation
	   warning), $uri-&gtisbn_as_ean.

       urn:oid:
	   The "urn:oid:" namespace contains Object Identifiers (OIDs) and is
	   described in RFC 3061.  An object identifier consists of sequences
	   of digits separated by dots.  A "URI" object belonging to this
	   namespace has an additional method called $uri-&gtoid that can be
	   used to get/set the oid value.  In a list context, oid numbers are
	   returned as separate elements.

CONFIGURATION VARIABLES
       The following configuration variables influence how the class and its
       methods behave:

       $URI::ABS_ALLOW_RELATIVE_SCHEME
	   Some older parsers used to allow the scheme name to be present in
	   the relative URL if it was the same as the base URL scheme.	RFC
	   2396 says that this should be avoided, but you can enable this old
	   behaviour by setting the $URI::ABS_ALLOW_RELATIVE_SCHEME variable
	   to a TRUE value.  The difference is demonstrated by the following
	   examples:

	     URI-&gtnew("http:foo")-&gtabs("http://host/a/b")
		 ==&gt  "http:foo"

	     local $URI::ABS_ALLOW_RELATIVE_SCHEME = 1;
	     URI-&gtnew("http:foo")-&gtabs("http://host/a/b")
		 ==&gt  "http:/host/a/foo"

       $URI::ABS_REMOTE_LEADING_DOTS
	   You can also have the abs() method ignore excess ".."  segments in
	   the relative URI by setting $URI::ABS_REMOTE_LEADING_DOTS to a TRUE
	   value.  The difference is demonstrated by the following examples:

	     URI-&gtnew("../../../foo")-&gtabs("http://host/a/b")
		 ==&gt "http://host/../../foo"

	     local $URI::ABS_REMOTE_LEADING_DOTS = 1;
	     URI-&gtnew("../../../foo")-&gtabs("http://host/a/b")
		 ==&gt "http://host/foo"

       $URI::DEFAULT_QUERY_FORM_DELIMITER
	   This value can be set to ";" to have the query form "key=value"
	   pairs delimited by ";" instead of "&" which is the default.

BUGS
       There are some things that are not quite right:

       o   Using regexp variables like $1 directly as arguments to the URI
	   accessor methods does not work too well with current perl
	   implementations.  I would argue that this is actually a bug in
	   perl.  The workaround is to quote them. Example:

	      /(...)/ || die;
	      $u-&gtquery("$1");

       o   The escaping (percent encoding) of chars in the 128 .. 255 range
	   passed to the URI constructor or when setting URI parts using the
	   accessor methods depend on the state of the internal UTF8 flag (see
	   utf8::is_utf8) of the string passed.  If the UTF8 flag is set the
	   UTF-8 encoded version of the character is percent encoded.  If the
	   UTF8 flag isn't set the Latin-1 version (byte) of the character is
	   percent encoded.  This basically exposes the internal encoding of
	   Perl strings.

PARSING URIs WITH REGEXP
       As an alternative to this module, the following (official) regular
       expression can be used to decode a URI:

	 my($scheme, $authority, $path, $query, $fragment) =
	 $uri =~ m|(?:([^:/?#]+):)?(?://([^/?#]*))?([^?#]*)(?:\?([^#]*))?(?:#(.*))?|;

       The "URI::Split" module provides the function uri_split() as a readable
       alternative.

AUTHORS / ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
       This module is based on the "URI::URL" module, which in turn was
       (distantly) based on the "wwwurl.pl" code in the libwww-perl for perl4
       developed by Roy Fielding, as part of the Arcadia project at the
       University of California, Irvine, with contributions from Brooks
       Cutter.

       "URI::URL" was developed by Gisle Aas, Tim Bunce, Roy Fielding and
       Martijn Koster with input from other people on the libwww-perl mailing
       list.

       "URI" and related subclasses was developed by Gisle Aas.
