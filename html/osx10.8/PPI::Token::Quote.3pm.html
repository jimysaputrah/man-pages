NAME
       PPI::Token::Quote - String quote abstract base class

INHERITANCE
	 PPI::Token::Quote
	 isa PPI::Token
	     isa PPI::Element

DESCRIPTION
       The "PPI::Token::Quote" class is never instantiated, and simply
       provides a common abstract base class for the four quote classes.  In
       PPI, a "quote" is limited to only the quote-like things that themselves
       directly represent a string. (although this includes double quotes with
       interpolated elements inside them).

       The subclasses of "PPI::Token::Quote" are:

       '' - PPI::Token::Quote::Single
       "q{}" - PPI::Token::Quote::Literal
       "" - PPI::Token::Quote::Double
       "qq{}" - PPI::Token::Quote::Interpolate

       The names are hopefully obvious enough not to have to explain what each
       class is here. See their respective pages for more details.

       Please note that although the here-doc does represent a literal string,
       it is such a nasty piece of work that in PPI it is given the honor of
       its own token class (PPI::Token::HereDoc).

METHODS
   string
       The "string" method is provided by all four ::Quote classes. It won't
       get you the actual literal Perl value, but it will strip off the
       wrapping of the quotes.

	 # The following all return foo from the ->string method
	 'foo'
	 "foo"
	 q{foo}
	 qq <foo>

   literal
       The "literal" method is provided by ::Quote:Literal and
       ::Quote::Single.  This returns the value of the string as Perl sees it:
       without the quote marks and with "\\" and "\'" resolved to "\" and "'".

       The "literal" method is not implemented by ::Quote::Double or
       ::Quote::Interpolate yet.

SUPPORT
       See the support section in the main module.
