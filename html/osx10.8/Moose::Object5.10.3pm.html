NAME
       Moose::Object - The base object for Moose

DESCRIPTION
       This class is the default base class for all Moose-using classes. When
       you "use Moose" in this class, your class will inherit from this class.

       It provides a default constructor and destructor, which run the
       "BUILDALL" and "DEMOLISHALL" methods respectively.

       You don't actually need to inherit from this in order to use Moose, but
       it makes it easier to take advantage of all of Moose's features.

METHODS
       Moose::Object-&gtnew(%params)
	   This method calls "$class-&gtBUILDARGS(@_)", and then creates a new
	   instance of the appropriate class. Once the instance is created, it
	   calls "$instance-&gtBUILDALL($params)".

       Moose::Object-&gtBUILDARGS(%params)
	   The default implementation of this method accepts a hash or hash
	   reference of named parameters. If it receives a single argument
	   that isn't a hash reference it throws an error.

	   You can override this method in your class to handle other types of
	   options passed to the constructor.

	   This method should always return a hash reference of named options.

       $object-&gtBUILDALL($params)
	   This method will call every "BUILD" method in the inheritance
	   hierarchy, starting with the most distant parent class and ending
	   with the object's class.

	   The "BUILD" method will be passed the hash reference returned by
	   "BUILDARGS".

       $object-&gtDEMOLISHALL
	   This will call every "DEMOLISH" method in the inheritance
	   hierarchy, starting with the object's class and ending with the
	   most distant parent. "DEMOLISHALL" and "DEMOLISH" will receive a
	   boolean indicating whether or not we are currently in global
	   destruction.

       $object-&gtdoes($role_name)
	   This returns true if the object does the given role.

       DOES ($class_or_role_name)
	   This is a a Moose role-aware implementation of "DOES" in UNIVERSAL.

	   This is effectively the same as writing:

	     $object-&gtdoes($name) || $object-&gtisa($name)

	   This method will work with Perl 5.8, which did not implement
	   "UNIVERSAL::DOES".

       $object-&gtdump($maxdepth)
	   This is a handy utility for "Data::Dumper"ing an object. By
	   default, the maximum depth is 1, to avoid making a mess.

       See "BUGS" in Moose for details on reporting bugs.
