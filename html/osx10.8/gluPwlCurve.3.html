NAME
       gluPwlCurve - describe a piecewise linear NURBS trimming curve


C SPECIFICATION
       void gluPwlCurve( GLUnurbs* nurb,
			 GLint count,
			 GLfloat* data,
			 GLint stride,
			 GLenum type )


PARAMETERS
       nurb    Specifies  the NURBS object (created with gluNewNurbsRenderer).

       count   Specifies the number of points on the curve.

       data    Specifies an array containing the curve points.

       stride  Specifies the offset (a number  of  single-precision  floating-
	       point values) between points on the curve.

       type    Specifies the type of curve.  Must be either GLU_MAP1_TRIM_2 or
	       GLU_MAP1_TRIM_3.

DESCRIPTION
       gluPwlCurve describes a piecewise linear trimming  curve  for  a  NURBS
       surface.  A piecewise linear curve consists of a list of coordinates of
       points in the parameter space for the  NURBS  surface  to  be  trimmed.
       These  points  are connected with line segments to form a curve. If the
       curve is an approximation to a curve that is not piecewise linear,  the
       points  should  be  close  enough in parameter space that the resulting
       path appears curved at the resolution used in the application.

       If type is GLU_MAP1_TRIM_2, then it describes  a  curve	in  two-dimen-
       sional  (u  and	v)  parameter space. If it is GLU_MAP1_TRIM_3, then it
       describes a curve in two-dimensional homogeneous (u, v, and w)  parame-
       ter  space.   See  the gluBeginTrim reference page for more information
       about trimming curves.

NOTES
       To describe a trim curve that closely follows the contours of  a  NURBS
       surface, call gluNurbsCurve.
