NAME
       Tk_AllocFontFromObj,   Tk_GetFont,   Tk_GetFontFromObj,	Tk_NameOfFont,
       Tk_FreeFontFromObj, Tk_FreeFont - maintain database of fonts

SYNOPSIS
       #include <tk.h>

       Tk_Font
       Tk_AllocFontFromObj(interp, tkwin, objPtr)

       Tk_Font
       Tk_GetFont(interp, tkwin, string)

       Tk_Font
       Tk_GetFontFromObj(tkwin, objPtr)

       const char *
       Tk_NameOfFont(tkfont)

       Tk_Font
       Tk_FreeFontFromObj(tkwin, objPtr)

       void
       Tk_FreeFont(tkfont)


ARGUMENTS
       Tcl_Interp *interp (in)		Interpreter to use for	error  report-
					ing.   If NULL, then no error messages
					are left after errors.

       Tk_Window tkwin (in)		Token for window in which font will be
					used.

       Tcl_Obj *objPtr (in/out) 	Gives  name  or  description  of font.
					See documentation for the font command
					for  details  on  acceptable  formats.
					Internal rep will be modified to cache
					corresponding Tk_Font.

       const char *string (in)		Same  as  objPtr except description of
					font is passed as a string and result-
					ing Tk_Font is not cached.

       Tk_Font tkfont (in)		Opaque font token.

DESCRIPTION
       Tk_AllocFontFromObj  finds  the	font indicated by objPtr and returns a
       token that represents the font.	The return value can be used in subse-
       quent  calls  to procedures such as Tk_GetFontMetrics, Tk_MeasureChars,
       and Tk_FreeFont.  The Tk_Font token will remain	valid  until  Tk_Free-
       FontFromObj or Tk_FreeFont is called to release it.  ObjPtr can contain
       either a symbolic name or a font description; see the documentation for
       the  font command for a description of the valid formats.  If Tk_Alloc-
       FontFromObj is unsuccessful (because, for example, objPtr did not  con-
       tain  a	valid  font  specification) then it returns NULL and leaves an
       error message in interp's result if interp is not NULL.	 Tk_AllocFont-
       FromObj	caches	information  about  the  return value in objPtr, which
       speeds up future calls to procedures such  as  Tk_AllocFontFromObj  and
       Tk_GetFontFromObj.

       Tk_GetFont is identical to Tk_AllocFontFromObj except that the descrip-
       tion of the font is specified with a string instead of an object.  This
       prevents Tk_GetFont from caching the matching Tk_Font, so Tk_GetFont is
       less efficient than Tk_AllocFontFromObj.

       Tk_GetFontFromObj returns the token for an  existing  font,  given  the
       window and description used to create the font.	Tk_GetFontFromObj does
       not actually create the font; the font must already have  been  created
       with  a previous call to Tk_AllocFontFromObj or Tk_GetFont.  The return
       value is cached in objPtr, which speeds up future calls to  Tk_GetFont-
       FromObj with the same objPtr and tkwin.

       Tk_AllocFontFromObj  and  Tk_GetFont  maintain  a database of all fonts
       they have allocated.  If the same  font	is  requested  multiple  times
       (e.g.  by  different  windows or for different purposes), then a single
       Tk_Font will be shared for all uses.  The underlying resources will  be
       freed automatically when no-one is using the font anymore.

       The  procedure  Tk_NameOfFont  is  roughly  the	inverse of Tk_GetFont.
       Given a tkfont that was created by Tk_GetFont (or Tk_AllocFontFromObj),
       the  return  value is the string argument that was passed to Tk_GetFont
       to create the font.  The string returned by Tk_NameOfFont is only guar-
       anteed  to  persist  until  the tkfont is deleted.  The caller must not
       modify this string.

       When a font is no  longer  needed,  Tk_FreeFontFromObj  or  Tk_FreeFont
       should  be  called  to  release it.  For Tk_FreeFontFromObj the font to
       release is specified with the same information used to create  it;  for
       Tk_FreeFont  the  font  to release is specified with its Tk_Font token.
       There should be exactly one call to Tk_FreeFontFromObj  or  Tk_FreeFont
       for each call to Tk_AllocFontFromObj or Tk_GetFont.
