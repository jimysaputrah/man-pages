AU_BSM_TO_FCNTL_CMD(3)	 BSD Library Functions Manual	AU_BSM_TO_FCNTL_CMD(3)

NAME
     au_bsm_to_fcntl_cmd, au_fcntl_cmd_to_bsm -- convert between BSM and local
     fcntl(2) command values

LIBRARY
     Basic Security Module Library (libbsm, -lbsm)

SYNOPSIS
     #include &ltbsm/libbsm.h&gt

     int
     au_bsm_to_fcntl_cmd(u_short bsm_fcntl_cmd, int *local_fcntl_cmdp);

     u_short
     au_fcntl_cmd_to_bsm(int local_fcntl_cmd);

DESCRIPTION
     These interfaces may be used to convert between the local and BSM
     fcntl(2) command values.  The au_bsm_to_fcntl_cmd() function accepts a
     BSM command value, bsm_fcntl_cmd, and converts it to a local command
     value passed to fcntl(2), that will be stored in the integer pointed to
     by local_fcntl_cmdp if successful.  This call will fail if the BSM com-
     mand value cannot be mapped into a local fcntl(2) command value which may
     occur if the command token was generated on another operating system.

     The au_fcntl_cmd_to_bsm() function accepts a local fcntl(2) command
     value, and returns the BSM fcntl(2) command value for it.	This call can-
     not fail, and instead returns a BSM command value indicating to a later
     decoder that the command value could not be encoded.

RETURN VALULES
     On success, au_bsm_to_fcntl_cmd() returns 0 and a converted command
     value; on failure, it returns -1 but does not set errno(2).

HISTORY
     au_bsm_to_domain() and au_domain_to_bsm() were introduced in OpenBSM 1.1.

AUTHORS
     These functions were implemented by Stacey Son under contract to Apple
     Inc.

     The Basic Security Module (BSM) interface to audit records and audit
     event stream format were defined by Sun Microsystems.
