NAME
       glCallList - execute a display list


C SPECIFICATION
       void glCallList( GLuint list )


PARAMETERS
       list  Specifies the integer name of the display list to be executed.

DESCRIPTION
       glCallList  causes the named display list to be executed.  The commands
       saved in the display list are executed in order, just as if  they  were
       called without using a display list.  If list has not been defined as a
       display list, glCallList is ignored.

       glCallList can appear inside a display list.  To avoid the  possibility
       of infinite recursion resulting from display lists calling one another,
       a limit is placed on the nesting level of display lists during display-
       list  execution.   This	limit  is  at  least 64, and it depends on the
       implementation.

       GL state is not saved and restored across a call to glCallList.	 Thus,
       changes	made to GL state during the execution of a display list remain
       after execution of the display list is  completed.   Use  glPushAttrib,
       glPopAttrib,  glPushMatrix, and glPopMatrix to preserve GL state across
       glCallList calls.

NOTES
       Display lists can be executed between a call to glBegin and the	corre-
       sponding  call to glEnd, as long as the display list includes only com-
       mands that are allowed in this interval.

ASSOCIATED GETS
       glGet with argument GL_MAX_LIST_NESTING
       glIsList
