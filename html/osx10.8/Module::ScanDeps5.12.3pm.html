Module::ScanDeps(3)   User Contributed Perl Documentation  Module::ScanDeps(3)



NAME
       Module::ScanDeps - Recursively scan Perl code for dependencies

SYNOPSIS
       Via the command-line program scandeps.pl:

	   % scandeps.pl *.pm	       # Print PREREQ_PM section for *.pm
	   % scandeps.pl -e "use utf8" # Read script from command line
	   % scandeps.pl -B *.pm       # Include core modules
	   % scandeps.pl -V *.pm       # Show autoload/shared/data files

       Used in a program;

	   use Module::ScanDeps;

	   # standard usage
	   my $hash_ref = scan_deps(
	       files   =&gt [ 'a.pl', 'b.pl' ],
	       recurse =&gt 1,
	   );

	   # shorthand; assume recurse == 1
	   my $hash_ref = scan_deps( 'a.pl', 'b.pl' );

	   # App::Packer::Frontend compatible interface
	   # see App::Packer::Frontend for the structure returned by get_files
	   my $scan = Module::ScanDeps-&gtnew;
	   $scan-&gtset_file( 'a.pl' );
	   $scan-&gtset_options( add_modules =&gt [ 'Test::More' ] );
	   $scan-&gtcalculate_info;
	   my $files = $scan-&gtget_files;

DESCRIPTION
       This module scans potential modules used by perl programs, and returns
       a hash reference; its keys are the module names as appears in %INC
       (e.g. "Test/More.pm"); the values are hash references with this
       structure:

	   {
	       file    =&gt '/usr/local/lib/perl5/5.8.0/Test/More.pm',
	       key     =&gt 'Test/More.pm',
	       type    =&gt 'module',    # or 'autoload', 'data', 'shared'
	       used_by =&gt [ 'Test/Simple.pm', ... ],
	       uses    =&gt [ 'Test/Other.pm', ... ],
	   }

       One function, "scan_deps", is exported by default.  Other functions
       such as ("scan_line", "scan_chunk", "add_deps", "path_to_inc_name") are
       exported upon request.

       Users of App::Packer may also use this module as the dependency-
       checking frontend, by tweaking their p2e.pl like below:

	   use Module::ScanDeps;
	   ...
	   my $packer = App::Packer-&gtnew( frontend =&gt 'Module::ScanDeps' );
	   ...

       Please see App::Packer::Frontend for detailed explanation on the
       structure returned by "get_files".

   scan_deps
	   $rv_ref = scan_deps(
	       files	  =&gt \@files,	  recurse =&gt $recurse,
	       rv	  =&gt \%rv,	  skip	  =&gt \%skip,
	       compile	  =&gt $compile,	  execute =&gt $execute,
	   );
	   $rv_ref = scan_deps(@files); # shorthand, with recurse =&gt 1

       This function scans each file in @files, registering their dependencies
       into %rv, and returns a reference to the updated %rv.  The meaning of
       keys and values are explained above.

       If $recurse is true, "scan_deps" will call itself recursively, to
       perform a breadth-first search on text files (as defined by the -T
       operator) found in %rv.

       If the "\%skip" is specified, files that exists as its keys are
       skipped.  This is used internally to avoid infinite recursion.

       If $compile or $execute is true, runs "files" in either compile-only or
       normal mode, then inspects their %INC after termination to determine
       additional runtime dependencies.

       If $execute is an array reference, runs the files contained in it
       instead of @files.

       If performance of the scanning process is a concern, "cache_file" can
       be set to a filename. The scanning results will be cached and written
       to the file. This will speed up the scanning process on subsequent
       runs.

       Additionally, an option "warn_missing" is recognized. If set to true,
       "scan_deps" issues a warning to STDERR for every module file that the
       scanned code depends but that wasn't found. Please note that this may
       also report numerous false positives. That is why by default, the
       heuristic silently drops all dependencies it cannot find.

   scan_deps_runtime
       Like scan_deps, but skips the static scanning part.

   scan_line
	   @modules = scan_line($line);

       Splits a line into chunks (currently with the semicolon characters),
       and return the union of "scan_chunk" calls of them.

       If the line is "__END__" or "__DATA__", a single "__END__" element is
       returned to signify the end of the program.

       Similarly, it returns a single "__POD__" if the line matches "/^=\w/";
       the caller is responsible for skipping appropriate number of lines
       until "=cut", before calling "scan_line" again.

   scan_chunk
	   $module = scan_chunk($chunk);
	   @modules = scan_chunk($chunk);

       Apply various heuristics to $chunk to find and return the module
       name(s) it contains.  In scalar context, returns only the first module
       or "undef".

   add_deps
	   $rv_ref = add_deps( rv =&gt \%rv, modules =&gt \@modules );
	   $rv_ref = add_deps( @modules ); # shorthand, without rv

       Resolves a list of module names to its actual on-disk location, by
       finding in @INC and @Module::ScanDeps::IncludeLibs; modules that cannot
       be found are skipped.

       This function populates the %rv hash with module/filename pairs, and
       returns a reference to it.

   path_to_inc_name
	   $perl_name = path_to_inc_name($path, $warn)

       Assumes $path refers to a perl file and does it's best to return the
       name as it would appear in %INC. Returns undef if no match was found
       and a prints a warning to STDERR if $warn is true.

       E.g. if $path = perl/site/lib/Module/ScanDeps.pm then $perl_name will
       be Module/ScanDeps.pm.

NOTES
   @Module::ScanDeps::IncludeLibs
       You can set this global variable to specify additional directories in
       which to search modules without modifying @INC itself.

   $Module::ScanDeps::ScanFileRE
       You can set this global variable to specify a regular expression to
       identify what files to scan. By default it includes all files of the
       following types: .pm, .pl, .t and .al. Additionally, all files without
       a suffix are considered.

       For instance, if you want to scan all files then use the following:

       "$Module::ScanDeps::ScanFileRE = qr/./"

CAVEATS
       This module intentially ignores the BSDPAN hack on FreeBSD -- the
       additional directory is removed from @INC altogether.

       The static-scanning heuristic is not likely to be 100% accurate,
       especially on modules that dynamically load other modules.

       Chunks that span multiple lines are not handled correctly.  For
       example, this one works:

	   use base 'Foo::Bar';

       But this one does not:

	   use base
	       'Foo::Bar';

SEE ALSO
       scandeps.pl is a bundled utility that writes "PREREQ_PM" section for a
       number of files.

       An application of Module::ScanDeps is to generate executables from
       scripts that contains prerequisite modules; this module supports two
       such projects, PAR and App::Packer.  Please see their respective
       documentations on CPAN for further information.
