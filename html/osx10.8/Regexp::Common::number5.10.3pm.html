NAME
       Regexp::Common::number -- provide regexes for numbers

SYNOPSIS
	   use Regexp::Common qw /number/;

	   while (<>) {
	       /^$RE{num}{int}$/		and  print "Integer\n";
	       /^$RE{num}{real}$/		and  print "Real\n";
	       /^$RE{num}{real}{-base => 16}$/	and  print "Hexadecimal real\n";
	   }

DESCRIPTION
       Please consult the manual of Regexp::Common for a general description
       of the works of this interface.

       Do not use this module directly, but load it via Regexp::Common.

   $RE{num}{int}{-base}{-sep}{-group}{-places}
       Returns a pattern that matches an integer.

       If "-base => B" is specified, the integer is in base B, with "2 <= B <=
       36". For bases larger than 10, upper case letters are used. The default
       base is 10.

       If "-sep => P" is specified, the pattern P is required as a grouping
       marker within the number. If this option is not given, no grouping
       marker is used.

       If "-group => N" is specified, digits between grouping markers must be
       grouped in sequences of exactly N digits. The default value of N is 3.
       If "-group => N,M" is specified, digits between grouping markers must
       be grouped in sequences of at least N digits, and at most M digits.
       This option is ignored unless the "-sep" option is used.

       If "-places => N" is specified, the integer recognized must be exactly
       N digits wide. If "-places => N,M" is specified, the integer must be at
       least N wide, and at most M characters. There is no default, which
       means that integers are unlimited in size. This option is ignored if
       the "-sep" option is used.

       For example:

	$RE{num}{int}			       # match 1234567
	$RE{num}{int}{-sep=>','}	       # match 1,234,567
	$RE{num}{int}{-sep=>',?'}	       # match 1234567 or 1,234,567
	$RE{num}{int}{-sep=>'.'}{-group=>4}    # match 1.2345.6789

       Under "-keep" (see Regexp::Common):

       $1  captures the entire number

       $2  captures the optional sign of the number

       $3  captures the complete set of digits

   $RE{num}{real}{-base}{-radix}{-places}{-sep}{-group}{-expon}
       Returns a pattern that matches a floating-point number.

       If "-base=N" is specified, the number is assumed to be in that base
       (with A..Z representing the digits for 11..36). By default, the base is
       10.

       If "-radix=P" is specified, the pattern P is used as the radix point
       for the number (i.e. the "decimal point" in base 10). The default is
       "qr/[.]/".

       If "-places=N" is specified, the number is assumed to have exactly N
       places after the radix point.  If "-places=M,N" is specified, the
       number is assumed to have between M and N places after the radix point.
       By default, the number of places is unrestricted.

       If "-sep=P" specified, the pattern P is required as a grouping marker
       within the pre-radix section of the number. By default, no separator is
       allowed.

       If "-group=N" is specified, digits between grouping separators must be
       grouped in sequences of exactly N characters. The default value of N is
       3.

       If "-expon=P" is specified, the pattern P is used as the exponential
       marker.	The default value of P is "qr/[Ee]/".

       For example:

	$RE{num}{real}			# matches 123.456 or -0.1234567
	$RE{num}{real}{-places=>2}	# matches 123.45 or -0.12
	$RE{num}{real}{-places=>'0,3'}	# matches 123.456 or 0 or 9.8
	$RE{num}{real}{-sep=>'[,.]?'}	# matches 123,456 or 123.456
	$RE{num}{real}{-base=>3'}	# matches 121.102

       Under "-keep":

       $1  captures the entire match

       $2  captures the optional sign of the number

       $3  captures the complete mantissa

       $4  captures the whole number portion of the mantissa

       $5  captures the radix point

       $6  captures the fractional portion of the mantissa

       $7  captures the optional exponent marker

       $8  captures the entire exponent value

       $9  captures the optional sign of the exponent

       $10 captures the digits of the exponent

   $RE{num}{dec}{-radix}{-places}{-sep}{-group}{-expon}
       A synonym for $RE{num}{real}{-base=>10}{...}

   $RE{num}{oct}{-radix}{-places}{-sep}{-group}{-expon}
       A synonym for $RE{num}{real}{-base=>8}{...}

   $RE{num}{bin}{-radix}{-places}{-sep}{-group}{-expon}
       A synonym for $RE{num}{real}{-base=>2}{...}

   $RE{num}{hex}{-radix}{-places}{-sep}{-group}{-expon}
       A synonym for $RE{num}{real}{-base=>16}{...}

   $RE{num}{decimal}{-base}{-radix}{-places}{-sep}{-group}
       The same as $RE{num}{real}, except that an exponent isn't allowed.
       Hence, this returns a pattern matching decimal numbers.

       If "-base=N" is specified, the number is assumed to be in that base
       (with A..Z representing the digits for 11..36). By default, the base is
       10.

       If "-radix=P" is specified, the pattern P is used as the radix point
       for the number (i.e. the "decimal point" in base 10). The default is
       "qr/[.]/".

       If "-places=N" is specified, the number is assumed to have exactly N
       places after the radix point.  If "-places=M,N" is specified, the
       number is assumed to have between M and N places after the radix point.
       By default, the number of places is unrestricted.

       If "-sep=P" specified, the pattern P is required as a grouping marker
       within the pre-radix section of the number. By default, no separator is
       allowed.

       If "-group=N" is specified, digits between grouping separators must be
       grouped in sequences of exactly N characters. The default value of N is
       3.

       For example:

	$RE{num}{decimal}		   # matches 123.456 or -0.1234567
	$RE{num}{decimal}{-places=>2}	   # matches 123.45 or -0.12
	$RE{num}{decimal}{-places=>'0,3'}  # matches 123.456 or 0 or 9.8
	$RE{num}{decimal}{-sep=>'[,.]?'}   # matches 123,456 or 123.456
	$RE{num}{decimal}{-base=>3'}	   # matches 121.102

       Under "-keep":

       $1  captures the entire match

       $2  captures the optional sign of the number

       $3  captures the complete mantissa

       $4  captures the whole number portion of the mantissa

       $5  captures the radix point

       $6  captures the fractional portion of the mantissa

   $RE{num}{square}
       Returns a pattern that matches a (decimal) square. Because Perl's
       arithmetic is lossy when using integers over about 53 bits, this
       pattern only recognizes numbers less than 9000000000000000, if one uses
       a Perl that is configured to use 64 bit integers. Otherwise, the limit
       is 2147483647. These restrictions were introduced in versions 2.116 and
       2.117 of Regexp::Common. Regardless whether "-keep" was set, the
       matched number will be returned in $1.

       This pattern is available for version 5.008 and up.

   $RE{num}{roman}
       Returns a pattern that matches an integer written in Roman numbers.
       Case doesn't matter. Only the more modern style, that is, no more than
       three repetitions of a letter, is recognized. The largest number
       matched is MMMCMXCIX, or 3999. Larger numbers cannot be expressed using
       ASCII characters. A future version will be able to deal with the
       Unicode symbols to match larger Roman numbers.

       Under "-keep", the number will be captured in $1.
