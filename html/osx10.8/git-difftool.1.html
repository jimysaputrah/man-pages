GIT-DIFFTOOL(1) 		  Git Manual		       GIT-DIFFTOOL(1)



NAME
       git-difftool - Show changes using common diff tools

SYNOPSIS
       git difftool [&ltoptions&gt] [&ltcommit&gt [&ltcommit&gt]] [--] [&ltpath&gt...]


DESCRIPTION
       git difftool is a git command that allows you to compare and edit files
       between revisions using common diff tools. git difftool is a frontend
       to git diff and accepts the same options and arguments. See git-
       diff(1).

OPTIONS
       -d, --dir-diff
	   Copy the modified files to a temporary location and perform a
	   directory diff on them. This mode never prompts before launching
	   the diff tool.

       -y, --no-prompt
	   Do not prompt before launching a diff tool.

       --prompt
	   Prompt before each invocation of the diff tool. This is the default
	   behaviour; the option is provided to override any configuration
	   settings.

       -t &lttool&gt, --tool=&lttool&gt
	   Use the diff tool specified by &lttool&gt. Valid values include emerge,
	   kompare, meld, and vimdiff. Run git difftool --tool-help for the
	   list of valid &lttool&gt settings.

	   If a diff tool is not specified, git difftool will use the
	   configuration variable diff.tool. If the configuration variable
	   diff.tool is not set, git difftool will pick a suitable default.

	   You can explicitly provide a full path to the tool by setting the
	   configuration variable difftool.&lttool&gt.path. For example, you can
	   configure the absolute path to kdiff3 by setting
	   difftool.kdiff3.path. Otherwise, git difftool assumes the tool is
	   available in PATH.

	   Instead of running one of the known diff tools, git difftool can be
	   customized to run an alternative program by specifying the command
	   line to invoke in a configuration variable difftool.&lttool&gt.cmd.

	   When git difftool is invoked with this tool (either through the -t
	   or --tool option or the diff.tool configuration variable) the
	   configured command line will be invoked with the following
	   variables available: $LOCAL is set to the name of the temporary
	   file containing the contents of the diff pre-image and $REMOTE is
	   set to the name of the temporary file containing the contents of
	   the diff post-image.  $MERGED is the name of the file which is
	   being compared.  $BASE is provided for compatibility with custom
	   merge tool commands and has the same value as $MERGED.

       --tool-help
	   Print a list of diff tools that may be used with --tool.

       -x &ltcommand&gt, --extcmd=&ltcommand&gt
	   Specify a custom command for viewing diffs.	git-difftool ignores
	   the configured defaults and runs $command $LOCAL $REMOTE when this
	   option is specified. Additionally, $BASE is set in the environment.

       -g, --gui
	   When git-difftool is invoked with the -g or --gui option the
	   default diff tool will be read from the configured diff.guitool
	   variable instead of diff.tool.

       See git-diff(1) for the full list of supported options.

CONFIG VARIABLES
       git difftool falls back to git mergetool config variables when the
       difftool equivalents have not been defined.

       diff.tool
	   The default diff tool to use.

       diff.guitool
	   The default diff tool to use when --gui is specified.

       difftool.&lttool&gt.path
	   Override the path for the given tool. This is useful in case your
	   tool is not in the PATH.

       difftool.&lttool&gt.cmd
	   Specify the command to invoke the specified diff tool.

	   See the --tool=&lttool&gt option above for more details.

       difftool.prompt
	   Prompt before each invocation of the diff tool.

SEE ALSO
       git-diff(1)
	   Show changes between commits, commit and working tree, etc

       git-mergetool(1)
	   Run merge conflict resolution tools to resolve merge conflicts

       git-config(1)
	   Get and set repository or global options
