NAME
       LOAD - load a shared library file

SYNOPSIS
       LOAD 'filename'

DESCRIPTION
       This command loads a shared library file into the PostgreSQL server's
       address space. If the file has been loaded already, the command does
       nothing. Shared library files that contain C functions are
       automatically loaded whenever one of their functions is called.
       Therefore, an explicit LOAD is usually only needed to load a library
       that modifies the server's behavior through "hooks" rather than
       providing a set of functions.

       The file name is specified in the same way as for shared library names
       in CREATE FUNCTION (CREATE_FUNCTION(7)); in particular, one can rely on
       a search path and automatic addition of the system's standard shared
       library file name extension. See Section 35.9, "C-Language Functions",
       in the documentation for more information on this topic.

       Non-superusers can only apply LOAD to library files located in
       $libdir/plugins/ -- the specified filename must begin with exactly that
       string. (It is the database administrator's responsibility to ensure
       that only "safe" libraries are installed there.)

COMPATIBILITY
       LOAD is a PostgreSQL extension.
