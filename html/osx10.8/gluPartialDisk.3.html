NAME
       gluPartialDisk - draw an arc of a disk


C SPECIFICATION
       void gluPartialDisk( GLUquadric* quad,
			    GLdouble inner,
			    GLdouble outer,
			    GLint slices,
			    GLint loops,
			    GLdouble start,
			    GLdouble sweep )


PARAMETERS
       quad    Specifies a quadrics object (created with gluNewQuadric).

       inner   Specifies the inner radius of the partial disk (can be 0).

       outer   Specifies the outer radius of the partial disk.

       slices  Specifies the number of subdivisions around the z axis.

       loops   Specifies  the number of concentric rings about the origin into
	       which the partial disk is subdivided.

       start   Specifies the starting angle, in degrees, of the disk  portion.

       sweep   Specifies the sweep angle, in degrees, of the disk portion.

DESCRIPTION
       gluPartialDisk  renders	a  partial  disk on the z = 0 plane. A partial
       disk is similar to a full disk, except that only the subset of the disk
       from  start through start + sweep is included (where 0 degrees is along
       the +y axis, 90 degrees along the +x axis, 180  degrees	along  the  -y
       axis, and 270 degrees along the -x axis).

       The  partial disk has a radius of outer, and contains a concentric cir-
       cular hole with a radius of inner. If inner is 0, then no hole is  gen-
       erated.	The  partial  disk is subdivided around the z axis into slices
       (like pizza slices), and also about the z axis into rings (as specified
       by slices and loops, respectively).

       With respect to orientation, the +z side of the partial disk is consid-
       ered to be outside (see gluQuadricOrientation).	This means that if the
       orientation  is	set  to  GLU_OUTSIDE, then any normals generated point
       along the +z axis. Otherwise, they point along the -z axis.

       If texturing is turned on (with gluQuadricTexture), texture coordinates
       are  generated  linearly such that where r = outer, the value at (r, 0,
       0) is (1.0, 0.5), at (0, r, 0) it is (0.5, 1.0), at (-r, 0,  0)	it  is
       (0.0, 0.5), and at (0, -r, 0) it is (0.5, 0.0).
