NAME
       EXECUTE - execute a prepared statement

SYNOPSIS
       EXECUTE name [ ( parameter [, ...] ) ]

DESCRIPTION
       EXECUTE is used to execute a previously prepared statement. Since
       prepared statements only exist for the duration of a session, the
       prepared statement must have been created by a PREPARE statement
       executed earlier in the current session.

       If the PREPARE statement that created the statement specified some
       parameters, a compatible set of parameters must be passed to the
       EXECUTE statement, or else an error is raised. Note that (unlike
       functions) prepared statements are not overloaded based on the type or
       number of their parameters; the name of a prepared statement must be
       unique within a database session.

       For more information on the creation and usage of prepared statements,
       see PREPARE(7).

PARAMETERS
       name
	   The name of the prepared statement to execute.

       parameter
	   The actual value of a parameter to the prepared statement. This
	   must be an expression yielding a value that is compatible with the
	   data type of this parameter, as was determined when the prepared
	   statement was created.

OUTPUTS
       The command tag returned by EXECUTE is that of the prepared statement,
       and not EXECUTE.

EXAMPLES
       Examples are given in the EXAMPLES section of the PREPARE(7)
       documentation.

COMPATIBILITY
       The SQL standard includes an EXECUTE statement, but it is only for use
       in embedded SQL. This version of the EXECUTE statement also uses a
       somewhat different syntax.
