NAME
       XML::LibXML::Common - Constants and Character Encoding Routines

SYNOPSIS
	 use XML::LibXML::Common;

	 $encodedstring = encodeToUTF8( $name_of_encoding, $sting_to_encode );
	 $decodedstring = decodeFromUTF8($name_of_encoding, $string_to_decode );

DESCRIPTION
       XML::LibXML::Common defines constants for all node types and provides
       interface to libxml2 charset conversion functions.

       Since XML::LibXML use their own node type definitions, one may want to
       use XML::LibXML::Common in its compatibility mode:

   Exporter TAGS
	 use XML::LibXML::Common qw(:libxml);

       ":libxml" tag will use the XML::LibXML Compatibility mode, which
       defines the old 'XML_' node-type definitions.

	 use XML::LibXML::Common qw(:gdome);

       ":gdome" tag will use the XML::GDOME Compatibility mode, which defines
       the old 'GDOME_' node-type definitions.

	 use XML::LibXML::Common qw(:w3c);

       This uses the nodetype definition names as specified for DOM.

	 use XML::LibXML::Common qw(:encoding);

       This tag can be used to export only the charset encoding functions of
       XML::LibXML::Common.

   Exports
       By default the W3 definitions as defined in the DOM specifications and
       the encoding functions are exported by XML::LibXML::Common.

   Encoding functions
       To encode or decode a string to or from UTF-8, XML::LibXML::Common
       exports two functions, which provide interfact to the encoding support
       in "libxml2". Which encodings are supported by these functions depends
       on how "libxml2" was compiled. UTF-16 is always supported and on most
       installations, ISO encodings are supported as well.

       This interface was useful for older versions of Perl. Since Perl >= 5.8
       provides similar funcions via the "Encode" module, it is probably a
       good idea to use those instead.

       encodeToUTF8
	     $encodedstring = encodeToUTF8( $name_of_encoding, $sting_to_encode );

	   The function will convert a byte string from the specified encoding
	   to an UTF-8 encoded character string.

       decodeToUTF8
	     $decodedstring = decodeFromUTF8($name_of_encoding, $string_to_decode );

	   This function converts an UTF-8 encoded character string to a
	   specified encoding. Note that the conversion can raise an error if
	   the given string contains characters that cannot be represented in
	   the target encoding.

       Both these functions report their errors on the standard error. If an
       error occours the function will croak(). To catch the error information
       it is required to call the encoding function from within an eval block
       in order to prevent the entire script from being stopped on encoding
       error.

   A note on history
       Before XML::LibXML 1.70, this class was available as a separate CPAN
       distribution, intended to provide functionality shared between
       XML::LibXML, XML::GDOME, and possibly other modules. Since there seems
       to be no progress in this direction, we decided to merge
       XML::LibXML::Common 0.13 and XML::LibXML 1.70 to one CPAN distribution.

       The merge also naturally eliminates a practical and urgent problem
       experienced by many XML::LibXML users on certain platforms, namely
       misterious misbehavior of XML::LibXML occurring if the installed (often
       pre-packaged) version of XML::LibXML::Common was compiled against an
       older version of libxml2 than XML::LibXML.
