DNSSEC-DSFROMKEY(8)		     BIND9		   DNSSEC-DSFROMKEY(8)



NAME
       dnssec-dsfromkey - DNSSEC DS RR generation tool

SYNOPSIS
       dnssec-dsfromkey [-v level] [-1] [-2] [-a alg] [-l domain] {keyfile}

       dnssec-dsfromkey {-s} [-1] [-2] [-a alg] [-K directory] [-l domain]
			[-s] [-c class] [-f file] [-A] [-v level] {dnsname}

DESCRIPTION
       dnssec-dsfromkey outputs the Delegation Signer (DS) resource record
       (RR), as defined in RFC 3658 and RFC 4509, for the given key(s).

OPTIONS
       -1
	   Use SHA-1 as the digest algorithm (the default is to use both SHA-1
	   and SHA-256).

       -2
	   Use SHA-256 as the digest algorithm.

       -a algorithm
	   Select the digest algorithm. The value of algorithm must be one of
	   SHA-1 (SHA1), SHA-256 (SHA256) or GOST. These values are case
	   insensitive.

       -K directory
	   Look for key files (or, in keyset mode, keyset- files) in
	   directory.

       -f file
	   Zone file mode: in place of the keyfile name, the argument is the
	   DNS domain name of a zone master file, which can be read from file.
	   If the zone name is the same as file, then it may be omitted.

       -A
	   Include ZSK's when generating DS records. Without this option, only
	   keys which have the KSK flag set will be converted to DS records
	   and printed. Useful only in zone file mode.

       -l domain
	   Generate a DLV set instead of a DS set. The specified domain is
	   appended to the name for each record in the set. The DNSSEC
	   Lookaside Validation (DLV) RR is described in RFC 4431.

       -s
	   Keyset mode: in place of the keyfile name, the argument is the DNS
	   domain name of a keyset file.

       -c class
	   Specifies the DNS class (default is IN). Useful only in keyset or
	   zone file mode.

       -v level
	   Sets the debugging level.

EXAMPLE
       To build the SHA-256 DS RR from the Kexample.com.+003+26160 keyfile
       name, the following command would be issued:

       dnssec-dsfromkey -2 Kexample.com.+003+26160

       The command would print something like:

       example.com. IN DS 26160 5 2
       3A1EADA7A74B8D0BA86726B0C227AA85AB8BBD2B2004F41A868A54F0 C5EA0B94

FILES
       The keyfile can be designed by the key identification Knnnn.+aaa+iiiii
       or the full file name Knnnn.+aaa+iiiii.key as generated by
       dnssec-keygen(8).

       The keyset file name is built from the directory, the string keyset-
       and the dnsname.

CAVEAT
       A keyfile error can give a "file not found" even if the file exists.
