NAME
       RSA_blinding_on, RSA_blinding_off - protect the RSA operation from
       timing attacks

SYNOPSIS
	#include <openssl/rsa.h>

	int RSA_blinding_on(RSA *rsa, BN_CTX *ctx);

	void RSA_blinding_off(RSA *rsa);

DESCRIPTION
       RSA is vulnerable to timing attacks. In a setup where attackers can
       measure the time of RSA decryption or signature operations, blinding
       must be used to protect the RSA operation from that attack.

       RSA_blinding_on() turns blinding on for key rsa and generates a random
       blinding factor. ctx is NULL or a pre-allocated and initialized BN_CTX.
       The random number generator must be seeded prior to calling
       RSA_blinding_on().

       RSA_blinding_off() turns blinding off and frees the memory used for the
       blinding factor.

RETURN VALUES
       RSA_blinding_on() returns 1 on success, and 0 if an error occurred.

       RSA_blinding_off() returns no value.

SEE ALSO
       rsa(3), rand(3)

HISTORY
       RSA_blinding_on() and RSA_blinding_off() appeared in SSLeay 0.9.0.
