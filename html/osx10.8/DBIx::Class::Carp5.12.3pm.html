NAME
       DBIx::Class::Carp - Provides advanced Carp::Clan-like warning functions
       for DBIx::Class internals

DESCRIPTION
       Documentation is lacking on purpose - this an experiment not yet fit
       for mass consumption. If you use this do not count on any kind of
       stability, in fact don't even count on this module's continuing
       existence (it has been noindexed for a reason).

       In addition to the classic interface:

	 use DBIx::Class::Carp '^DBIx::Class'

       this module also supports a class-data based way to specify the
       exclusion regex. A message is only carped from a callsite that matches
       neither the closed over string, nor the value of
       "_skip_namespace_frames" as declared on the first callframe origin.

CLASS ATTRIBUTES
   _skip_namespace_frames
       A classdata attribute holding the stringified regex matching callsites
       that should be skipped by the carp methods below. An empty string "q{}"
       is treated like no setting/"undef" (the distinction is necessary due to
       semantics of the class data accessors provided by
       Class::Accessor::Grouped)

EXPORTED FUNCTIONS
       This module export the following 3 functions. Only warning related
       "carp*" is being handled here, for "croak"-ing you must use
       "throw_exception" in DBIx::Class::Schema or DBIx::Class::Exception.

   carp
       Carps message with the file/line of the first callsite not matching
       "_skip_namespace_frames" nor the closed-over arguments to "use
       DBIx::Class::Carp".

   carp_unique
       Like "carp" but warns once for every distinct callsite (subject to the
       same ruleset as "carp").

   carp_once
       Like "carp" but warns only once for the life of the perl interpreter
       (regardless of callsite).
