NAME
       LWP::UserAgent - Web user agent class

SYNOPSIS
	require LWP::UserAgent;

	my $ua = LWP::UserAgent-&gtnew;
	$ua-&gttimeout(10);
	$ua-&gtenv_proxy;

	my $response = $ua-&gtget('http://search.cpan.org/');

	if ($response-&gtis_success) {
	    print $response-&gtdecoded_content;  # or whatever
	}
	else {
	    die $response-&gtstatus_line;
	}

DESCRIPTION
       The "LWP::UserAgent" is a class implementing a web user agent.
       "LWP::UserAgent" objects can be used to dispatch web requests.

       In normal use the application creates an "LWP::UserAgent" object, and
       then configures it with values for timeouts, proxies, name, etc. It
       then creates an instance of "HTTP::Request" for the request that needs
       to be performed. This request is then passed to one of the request
       method the UserAgent, which dispatches it using the relevant protocol,
       and returns a "HTTP::Response" object.  There are convenience methods
       for sending the most common request types: get(), head() and post().
       When using these methods then the creation of the request object is
       hidden as shown in the synopsis above.

       The basic approach of the library is to use HTTP style communication
       for all protocol schemes.  This means that you will construct
       "HTTP::Request" objects and receive "HTTP::Response" objects even for
       non-HTTP resources like gopher and ftp.	In order to achieve even more
       similarity to HTTP style communications, gopher menus and file
       directories are converted to HTML documents.

CONSTRUCTOR METHODS
       The following constructor methods are available:

       $ua = LWP::UserAgent-&gtnew( %options )
	   This method constructs a new "LWP::UserAgent" object and returns
	   it.	Key/value pair arguments may be provided to set up the initial
	   state.  The following options correspond to attribute methods
	   described below:

	      KEY		      DEFAULT
	      -----------	      --------------------
	      agent		      "libwww-perl/#.###"
	      from		      undef
	      conn_cache	      undef
	      cookie_jar	      undef
	      default_headers	      HTTP::Headers-&gtnew
	      local_address	      undef
	      ssl_opts		      { verify_hostname =&gt 1 }
	      max_size		      undef
	      max_redirect	      7
	      parse_head	      1
	      protocols_allowed       undef
	      protocols_forbidden     undef
	      requests_redirectable   ['GET', 'HEAD']
	      timeout		      180

	   The following additional options are also accepted: If the
	   "env_proxy" option is passed in with a TRUE value, then proxy
	   settings are read from environment variables (see env_proxy()
	   method below).  If "env_proxy" isn't provided the
	   "PERL_LWP_ENV_PROXY" envirionment variable controls if env_proxy()
	   is called during initalization.  If the "keep_alive" option is
	   passed in, then a "LWP::ConnCache" is set up (see conn_cache()
	   method below).  The "keep_alive" value is passed on as the
	   "total_capacity" for the connection cache.

       $ua-&gtclone
	   Returns a copy of the LWP::UserAgent object.

ATTRIBUTES
       The settings of the configuration attributes modify the behaviour of
       the "LWP::UserAgent" when it dispatches requests.  Most of these can
       also be initialized by options passed to the constructor method.

       The following attribute methods are provided.  The attribute value is
       left unchanged if no argument is given.	The return value from each
       method is the old attribute value.

       $ua-&gtagent
       $ua-&gtagent( $product_id )
	   Get/set the product token that is used to identify the user agent
	   on the network.  The agent value is sent as the "User-Agent" header
	   in the requests.  The default is the string returned by the
	   _agent() method (see below).

	   If the $product_id ends with space then the _agent() string is
	   appended to it.

	   The user agent string should be one or more simple product
	   identifiers with an optional version number separated by the "/"
	   character.  Examples are:

	     $ua-&gtagent('Checkbot/0.4 ' . $ua-&gt_agent);
	     $ua-&gtagent('Checkbot/0.4 ');    # same as above
	     $ua-&gtagent('Mozilla/5.0');
	     $ua-&gtagent("");		     # don't identify

       $ua-&gt_agent
	   Returns the default agent identifier.  This is a string of the form
	   "libwww-perl/#.###", where "#.###" is substituted with the version
	   number of this library.

       $ua-&gtfrom
       $ua-&gtfrom( $email_address )
	   Get/set the e-mail address for the human user who controls the
	   requesting user agent.  The address should be machine-usable, as
	   defined in RFC 822.	The "from" value is send as the "From" header
	   in the requests.  Example:

	     $ua-&gtfrom('gaas@cpan.org');

	   The default is to not send a "From" header.	See the
	   default_headers() method for the more general interface that allow
	   any header to be defaulted.

       $ua-&gtcookie_jar
       $ua-&gtcookie_jar( $cookie_jar_obj )
	   Get/set the cookie jar object to use.  The only requirement is that
	   the cookie jar object must implement the extract_cookies($request)
	   and add_cookie_header($response) methods.  These methods will then
	   be invoked by the user agent as requests are sent and responses are
	   received.  Normally this will be a "HTTP::Cookies" object or some
	   subclass.

	   The default is to have no cookie_jar, i.e. never automatically add
	   "Cookie" headers to the requests.

	   Shortcut: If a reference to a plain hash is passed in as the
	   $cookie_jar_object, then it is replaced with an instance of
	   "HTTP::Cookies" that is initialized based on the hash.  This form
	   also automatically loads the "HTTP::Cookies" module.  It means
	   that:

	     $ua-&gtcookie_jar({ file =&gt "$ENV{HOME}/.cookies.txt" });

	   is really just a shortcut for:

	     require HTTP::Cookies;
	     $ua-&gtcookie_jar(HTTP::Cookies-&gtnew(file =&gt "$ENV{HOME}/.cookies.txt"));

       $ua-&gtdefault_headers
       $ua-&gtdefault_headers( $headers_obj )
	   Get/set the headers object that will provide default header values
	   for any requests sent.  By default this will be an empty
	   "HTTP::Headers" object.

       $ua-&gtdefault_header( $field )
       $ua-&gtdefault_header( $field =&gt $value )
	   This is just a short-cut for $ua-&gtdefault_headers-&gtheader( $field
	   =&gt $value ). Example:

	     $ua-&gtdefault_header('Accept-Encoding' =&gt scalar HTTP::Message::decodable());
	     $ua-&gtdefault_header('Accept-Language' =&gt "no, en");

       $ua-&gtconn_cache
       $ua-&gtconn_cache( $cache_obj )
	   Get/set the "LWP::ConnCache" object to use.	See LWP::ConnCache for
	   details.

       $ua-&gtcredentials( $netloc, $realm )
       $ua-&gtcredentials( $netloc, $realm, $uname, $pass )
	   Get/set the user name and password to be used for a realm.

	   The $netloc is a string of the form "&lthost&gt:&ltport&gt".  The username
	   and password will only be passed to this server.  Example:

	     $ua-&gtcredentials("www.example.com:80", "Some Realm", "foo", "secret");

       $ua-&gtlocal_address
       $ua-&gtlocal_address( $address )
	   Get/set the local interface to bind to for network connections.
	   The interface can be specified as a hostname or an IP address.
	   This value is passed as the "LocalAddr" argument to
	   IO::Socket::INET.

       $ua-&gtmax_size
       $ua-&gtmax_size( $bytes )
	   Get/set the size limit for response content.  The default is
	   "undef", which means that there is no limit.  If the returned
	   response content is only partial, because the size limit was
	   exceeded, then a "Client-Aborted" header will be added to the
	   response.  The content might end up longer than "max_size" as we
	   abort once appending a chunk of data makes the length exceed the
	   limit.  The "Content-Length" header, if present, will indicate the
	   length of the full content and will normally not be the same as
	   "length($res-&gtcontent)".

       $ua-&gtmax_redirect
       $ua-&gtmax_redirect( $n )
	   This reads or sets the object's limit of how many times it will
	   obey redirection responses in a given request cycle.

	   By default, the value is 7. This means that if you call request()
	   method and the response is a redirect elsewhere which is in turn a
	   redirect, and so on seven times, then LWP gives up after that
	   seventh request.

       $ua-&gtparse_head
       $ua-&gtparse_head( $boolean )
	   Get/set a value indicating whether we should initialize response
	   headers from the &lthead&gt section of HTML documents. The default is
	   TRUE.  Do not turn this off, unless you know what you are doing.

       $ua-&gtprotocols_allowed
       $ua-&gtprotocols_allowed( \@protocols )
	   This reads (or sets) this user agent's list of protocols that the
	   request methods will exclusively allow.  The protocol names are
	   case insensitive.

	   For example: "$ua-&gtprotocols_allowed( [ 'http', 'https'] );" means
	   that this user agent will allow only those protocols, and attempts
	   to use this user agent to access URLs with any other schemes (like
	   "ftp://...") will result in a 500 error.

	   To delete the list, call: "$ua-&gtprotocols_allowed(undef)"

	   By default, an object has neither a "protocols_allowed" list, nor a
	   "protocols_forbidden" list.

	   Note that having a "protocols_allowed" list causes any
	   "protocols_forbidden" list to be ignored.

       $ua-&gtprotocols_forbidden
       $ua-&gtprotocols_forbidden( \@protocols )
	   This reads (or sets) this user agent's list of protocols that the
	   request method will not allow. The protocol names are case
	   insensitive.

	   For example: "$ua-&gtprotocols_forbidden( [ 'file', 'mailto'] );"
	   means that this user agent will not allow those protocols, and
	   attempts to use this user agent to access URLs with those schemes
	   will result in a 500 error.

	   To delete the list, call: "$ua-&gtprotocols_forbidden(undef)"

       $ua-&gtrequests_redirectable
       $ua-&gtrequests_redirectable( \@requests )
	   This reads or sets the object's list of request names that
	   "$ua-&gtredirect_ok(...)" will allow redirection for.	By default,
	   this is "['GET', 'HEAD']", as per RFC 2616.	To change to include
	   'POST', consider:

	      push @{ $ua-&gtrequests_redirectable }, 'POST';

       $ua-&gtshow_progress
       $ua-&gtshow_progress( $boolean )
	   Get/set a value indicating whether a progress bar should be
	   displayed on on the terminal as requests are processed. The default
	   is FALSE.

       $ua-&gttimeout
       $ua-&gttimeout( $secs )
	   Get/set the timeout value in seconds. The default timeout() value
	   is 180 seconds, i.e. 3 minutes.

	   The requests is aborted if no activity on the connection to the
	   server is observed for "timeout" seconds.  This means that the time
	   it takes for the complete transaction and the request() method to
	   actually return might be longer.

       $ua-&gtssl_opts
       $ua-&gtssl_opts( $key )
       $ua-&gtssl_opts( $key =&gt $value )
	   Get/set the options for SSL connections.  Without argument return
	   the list of options keys currently set.  With a single argument
	   return the current value for the given option.  With 2 arguments
	   set the option value and return the old.  Setting an option to the
	   value "undef" removes this option.

	   The options that LWP relates to are:

	   "verify_hostname" =&gt $bool
	       When TRUE LWP will for secure protocol schemes ensure it
	       connects to servers that have a valid certificate matching the
	       expected hostname.  If FALSE no checks are made and you can't
	       be sure that you communicate with the expected peer.  The no
	       checks behaviour was the default for libwww-perl-5.837 and
	       earlier releases.

	       This option is initialized from the
	       PERL_LWP_SSL_VERIFY_HOSTNAME environment variable.  If this
	       envirionment variable isn't set; then "verify_hostname"
	       defaults to 1.

	   "SSL_ca_file" =&gt $path
	       The path to a file containing Certificate Authority
	       certificates.  A default setting for this option is provided by
	       checking the environment variables "PERL_LWP_SSL_CA_FILE" and
	       "HTTPS_CA_FILE" in order.

	   "SSL_ca_path" =&gt $path
	       The path to a directory containing files containing Certificate
	       Authority certificates.	A default setting for this option is
	       provided by checking the environment variables
	       "PERL_LWP_SSL_CA_PATH" and "HTTPS_CA_DIR" in order.

	   Other options can be set and are processed directly by the SSL
	   Socket implementation in use.  See IO::Socket::SSL or Net::SSL for
	   details.

	   The libwww-perl core no longer bundles protocol plugins for SSL.
	   You will need to install LWP::Protocol::https separately to enable
	   support for processing https-URLs.

   Proxy attributes
       The following methods set up when requests should be passed via a proxy
       server.

       $ua-&gtproxy(\@schemes, $proxy_url)
       $ua-&gtproxy($scheme, $proxy_url)
	   Set/retrieve proxy URL for a scheme:

	    $ua-&gtproxy(['http', 'ftp'], 'http://proxy.sn.no:8001/');
	    $ua-&gtproxy('gopher', 'http://proxy.sn.no:8001/');

	   The first form specifies that the URL is to be used for proxying of
	   access methods listed in the list in the first method argument,
	   i.e. 'http' and 'ftp'.

	   The second form shows a shorthand form for specifying proxy URL for
	   a single access scheme.

       $ua-&gtno_proxy( $domain, ... )
	   Do not proxy requests to the given domains.	Calling no_proxy
	   without any domains clears the list of domains. Eg:

	    $ua-&gtno_proxy('localhost', 'example.com');

       $ua-&gtenv_proxy
	   Load proxy settings from *_proxy environment variables.  You might
	   specify proxies like this (sh-syntax):

	     gopher_proxy=http://proxy.my.place/
	     wais_proxy=http://proxy.my.place/
	     no_proxy="localhost,example.com"
	     export gopher_proxy wais_proxy no_proxy

	   csh or tcsh users should use the "setenv" command to define these
	   environment variables.

	   On systems with case insensitive environment variables there exists
	   a name clash between the CGI environment variables and the
	   "HTTP_PROXY" environment variable normally picked up by
	   env_proxy().  Because of this "HTTP_PROXY" is not honored for CGI
	   scripts.  The "CGI_HTTP_PROXY" environment variable can be used
	   instead.

   Handlers
       Handlers are code that injected at various phases during the processing
       of requests.  The following methods are provided to manage the active
       handlers:

       $ua-&gtadd_handler( $phase =&gt \&cb, %matchspec )
	   Add handler to be invoked in the given processing phase.  For how
	   to specify %matchspec see "Matching" in HTTP::Config.

	   The possible values $phase and the corresponding callback
	   signatures are:

	   request_preprepare =&gt sub { my($request, $ua, $h) = @_; ... }
	       The handler is called before the "request_prepare" and other
	       standard initialization of of the request.  This can be used to
	       set up headers and attributes that the "request_prepare"
	       handler depends on.  Proxy initialization should take place
	       here; but in general don't register handlers for this phase.

	   request_prepare =&gt sub { my($request, $ua, $h) = @_; ... }
	       The handler is called before the request is sent and can modify
	       the request any way it see fit.	This can for instance be used
	       to add certain headers to specific requests.

	       The method can assign a new request object to $_[0] to replace
	       the request that is sent fully.

	       The return value from the callback is ignored.  If an exception
	       is raised it will abort the request and make the request method
	       return a "400 Bad request" response.

	   request_send =&gt sub { my($request, $ua, $h) = @_; ... }
	       This handler gets a chance of handling requests before they're
	       sent to the protocol handlers.  It should return an
	       HTTP::Response object if it wishes to terminate the processing;
	       otherwise it should return nothing.

	       The "response_header" and "response_data" handlers will not be
	       invoked for this response, but the "response_done" will be.

	   response_header =&gt sub { my($response, $ua, $h) = @_; ... }
	       This handler is called right after the response headers have
	       been received, but before any content data.  The handler might
	       set up handlers for data and might croak to abort the request.

	       The handler might set the $response-&gt{default_add_content}
	       value to control if any received data should be added to the
	       response object directly.  This will initially be false if the
	       $ua-&gtrequest() method was called with a $content_file or
	       $content_cb argument; otherwise true.

	   response_data =&gt sub { my($response, $ua, $h, $data) = @_; ... }
	       This handler is called for each chunk of data received for the
	       response.  The handler might croak to abort the request.

	       This handler needs to return a TRUE value to be called again
	       for subsequent chunks for the same request.

	   response_done =&gt sub { my($response, $ua, $h) = @_; ... }
	       The handler is called after the response has been fully
	       received, but before any redirect handling is attempted.  The
	       handler can be used to extract information or modify the
	       response.

	   response_redirect =&gt sub { my($response, $ua, $h) = @_; ... }
	       The handler is called in $ua-&gtrequest after "response_done".
	       If the handler returns an HTTP::Request object we'll start over
	       with processing this request instead.

       $ua-&gtremove_handler( undef, %matchspec )
       $ua-&gtremove_handler( $phase, %matchspec )
	   Remove handlers that match the given %matchspec.  If $phase is not
	   provided remove handlers from all phases.

	   Be careful as calling this function with %matchspec that is not not
	   specific enough can remove handlers not owned by you.  It's
	   probably better to use the set_my_handler() method instead.

	   The removed handlers are returned.

       $ua-&gtset_my_handler( $phase, $cb, %matchspec )
	   Set handlers private to the executing subroutine.  Works by
	   defaulting an "owner" field to the %matchspec that holds the name
	   of the called subroutine.  You might pass an explicit "owner" to
	   override this.

	   If $cb is passed as "undef", remove the handler.

       $ua-&gtget_my_handler( $phase, %matchspec )
       $ua-&gtget_my_handler( $phase, %matchspec, $init )
	   Will retrieve the matching handler as hash ref.

	   If $init is passed passed as a TRUE value, create and add the
	   handler if it's not found.  If $init is a subroutine reference,
	   then it's called with the created handler hash as argument.	This
	   sub might populate the hash with extra fields; especially the
	   callback.  If $init is a hash reference, merge the hashes.

       $ua-&gthandlers( $phase, $request )
       $ua-&gthandlers( $phase, $response )
	   Returns the handlers that apply to the given request or response at
	   the given processing phase.

REQUEST METHODS
       The methods described in this section are used to dispatch requests via
       the user agent.	The following request methods are provided:

       $ua-&gtget( $url )
       $ua-&gtget( $url , $field_name =&gt $value, ... )
	   This method will dispatch a "GET" request on the given $url.
	   Further arguments can be given to initialize the headers of the
	   request. These are given as separate name/value pairs.  The return
	   value is a response object.	See HTTP::Response for a description
	   of the interface it provides.

	   There will still be a response object returned when LWP can't
	   connect to the server specified in the URL or when other failures
	   in protocol handlers occur.	These internal responses use the
	   standard HTTP status codes, so the responses can't be
	   differentiated by testing the response status code alone.  Error
	   responses that LWP generates internally will have the "Client-
	   Warning" header set to the value "Internal response".  If you need
	   to differentiate these internal responses from responses that a
	   remote server actually generates, you need to test this header
	   value.

	   Fields names that start with ":" are special.  These will not
	   initialize headers of the request but will determine how the
	   response content is treated.  The following special field names are
	   recognized:

	       :content_file   =&gt $filename
	       :content_cb     =&gt \&callback
	       :read_size_hint =&gt $bytes

	   If a $filename is provided with the ":content_file" option, then
	   the response content will be saved here instead of in the response
	   object.  If a callback is provided with the ":content_cb" option
	   then this function will be called for each chunk of the response
	   content as it is received from the server.  If neither of these
	   options are given, then the response content will accumulate in the
	   response object itself.  This might not be suitable for very large
	   response bodies.  Only one of ":content_file" or ":content_cb" can
	   be specified.  The content of unsuccessful responses will always
	   accumulate in the response object itself, regardless of the
	   ":content_file" or ":content_cb" options passed in.

	   The ":read_size_hint" option is passed to the protocol module which
	   will try to read data from the server in chunks of this size.  A
	   smaller value for the ":read_size_hint" will result in a higher
	   number of callback invocations.

	   The callback function is called with 3 arguments: a chunk of data,
	   a reference to the response object, and a reference to the protocol
	   object.  The callback can abort the request by invoking die().  The
	   exception message will show up as the "X-Died" header field in the
	   response returned by the get() function.

       $ua-&gthead( $url )
       $ua-&gthead( $url , $field_name =&gt $value, ... )
	   This method will dispatch a "HEAD" request on the given $url.
	   Otherwise it works like the get() method described above.

       $ua-&gtpost( $url, \%form )
       $ua-&gtpost( $url, \@form )
       $ua-&gtpost( $url, \%form, $field_name =&gt $value, ... )
       $ua-&gtpost( $url, $field_name =&gt $value,... Content =&gt \%form )
       $ua-&gtpost( $url, $field_name =&gt $value,... Content =&gt \@form )
       $ua-&gtpost( $url, $field_name =&gt $value,... Content =&gt $content )
	   This method will dispatch a "POST" request on the given $url, with
	   %form or @form providing the key/value pairs for the fill-in form
	   content. Additional headers and content options are the same as for
	   the get() method.

	   This method will use the POST() function from
	   "HTTP::Request::Common" to build the request.  See
	   HTTP::Request::Common for a details on how to pass form content and
	   other advanced features.

       $ua-&gtmirror( $url, $filename )
	   This method will get the document identified by $url and store it
	   in file called $filename.  If the file already exists, then the
	   request will contain an "If-Modified-Since" header matching the
	   modification time of the file.  If the document on the server has
	   not changed since this time, then nothing happens.  If the document
	   has been updated, it will be downloaded again.  The modification
	   time of the file will be forced to match that of the server.

	   The return value is the the response object.

       $ua-&gtrequest( $request )
       $ua-&gtrequest( $request, $content_file )
       $ua-&gtrequest( $request, $content_cb )
       $ua-&gtrequest( $request, $content_cb, $read_size_hint )
	   This method will dispatch the given $request object.  Normally this
	   will be an instance of the "HTTP::Request" class, but any object
	   with a similar interface will do.  The return value is a response
	   object.  See HTTP::Request and HTTP::Response for a description of
	   the interface provided by these classes.

	   The request() method will process redirects and authentication
	   responses transparently.  This means that it may actually send
	   several simple requests via the simple_request() method described
	   below.

	   The request methods described above; get(), head(), post() and
	   mirror(), will all dispatch the request they build via this method.
	   They are convenience methods that simply hides the creation of the
	   request object for you.

	   The $content_file, $content_cb and $read_size_hint all correspond
	   to options described with the get() method above.

	   You are allowed to use a CODE reference as "content" in the request
	   object passed in.  The "content" function should return the content
	   when called.  The content can be returned in chunks.  The content
	   function will be invoked repeatedly until it return an empty string
	   to signal that there is no more content.

       $ua-&gtsimple_request( $request )
       $ua-&gtsimple_request( $request, $content_file )
       $ua-&gtsimple_request( $request, $content_cb )
       $ua-&gtsimple_request( $request, $content_cb, $read_size_hint )
	   This method dispatches a single request and returns the response
	   received.  Arguments are the same as for request() described above.

	   The difference from request() is that simple_request() will not try
	   to handle redirects or authentication responses.  The request()
	   method will in fact invoke this method for each simple request it
	   sends.

       $ua-&gtis_protocol_supported( $scheme )
	   You can use this method to test whether this user agent object
	   supports the specified "scheme".  (The "scheme" might be a string
	   (like 'http' or 'ftp') or it might be an URI object reference.)

	   Whether a scheme is supported, is determined by the user agent's
	   "protocols_allowed" or "protocols_forbidden" lists (if any), and by
	   the capabilities of LWP.  I.e., this will return TRUE only if LWP
	   supports this protocol and it's permitted for this particular
	   object.

   Callback methods
       The following methods will be invoked as requests are processed. These
       methods are documented here because subclasses of "LWP::UserAgent"
       might want to override their behaviour.

       $ua-&gtprepare_request( $request )
	   This method is invoked by simple_request().	Its task is to modify
	   the given $request object by setting up various headers based on
	   the attributes of the user agent. The return value should normally
	   be the $request object passed in.  If a different request object is
	   returned it will be the one actually processed.

	   The headers affected by the base implementation are; "User-Agent",
	   "From", "Range" and "Cookie".

       $ua-&gtredirect_ok( $prospective_request, $response )
	   This method is called by request() before it tries to follow a
	   redirection to the request in $response.  This should return a TRUE
	   value if this redirection is permissible.  The $prospective_request
	   will be the request to be sent if this method returns TRUE.

	   The base implementation will return FALSE unless the method is in
	   the object's "requests_redirectable" list, FALSE if the proposed
	   redirection is to a "file://..."  URL, and TRUE otherwise.

       $ua-&gtget_basic_credentials( $realm, $uri, $isproxy )
	   This is called by request() to retrieve credentials for documents
	   protected by Basic or Digest Authentication.  The arguments passed
	   in is the $realm provided by the server, the $uri requested and a
	   boolean flag to indicate if this is authentication against a proxy
	   server.

	   The method should return a username and password.  It should return
	   an empty list to abort the authentication resolution attempt.
	   Subclasses can override this method to prompt the user for the
	   information. An example of this can be found in "lwp-request"
	   program distributed with this library.

	   The base implementation simply checks a set of pre-stored member
	   variables, set up with the credentials() method.

       $ua-&gtprogress( $status, $request_or_response )
	   This is called frequently as the response is received regardless of
	   how the content is processed.  The method is called with $status
	   "begin" at the start of processing the request and with $state
	   "end" before the request method returns.  In between these $status
	   will be the fraction of the response currently received or the
	   string "tick" if the fraction can't be calculated.

	   When $status is "begin" the second argument is the request object,
	   otherwise it is the response object.
