NAME
       glHint - specify implementation-specific hints


C SPECIFICATION
       void glHint( GLenum target,
		    GLenum mode )


PARAMETERS
       target  Specifies  a  symbolic  constant  indicating the behavior to be
	       controlled.	    GL_FOG_HINT,	  GL_LINE_SMOOTH_HINT,
	       GL_PERSPECTIVE_CORRECTION_HINT,	  GL_POINT_SMOOTH_HINT,    and
	       GL_POLYGON_SMOOTH_HINT are accepted.

       mode    Specifies a symbolic constant indicating the desired  behavior.
	       GL_FASTEST, GL_NICEST, and GL_DONT_CARE are accepted.

DESCRIPTION
       Certain	aspects of GL behavior, when there is room for interpretation,
       can be controlled with hints.  A hint is specified with two  arguments.
       target is a symbolic constant indicating the behavior to be controlled,
       and mode is another symbolic constant indicating the desired  behavior.
       The  initial value for each target is GL_DONT_CARE.  mode can be one of
       the following:

       GL_FASTEST	   The most efficient option should be chosen.

       GL_NICEST	   The most correct, or highest quality, option should
			   be chosen.

       GL_DONT_CARE	   No preference.

       Though  the implementation aspects that can be hinted are well defined,
       the interpretation of the hints depends	on  the  implementation.   The
       hint  aspects  that  can be specified with target, along with suggested
       semantics, are as follows:

       GL_FOG_HINT	   Indicates the accuracy of fog calculation.  If per-
			   pixel  fog calculation is not efficiently supported
			   by the GL implementation, hinting  GL_DONT_CARE  or
			   GL_FASTEST  can result in per-vertex calculation of
			   fog effects.

       GL_LINE_SMOOTH_HINT Indicates  the  sampling  quality  of   antialiased
			   lines.   If	a  larger  filter function is applied,
			   hinting GL_NICEST can result in  more  pixel  frag-
			   ments being generated during rasterization,

       GL_PERSPECTIVE_CORRECTION_HINT
			   Indicates  the quality of color and texture coordi-
			   nate   interpolation.    If	 perspective-corrected
			   parameter  interpolation  is  not  efficiently sup-
			   ported   by	 the   GL   implementation,    hinting
			   GL_DONT_CARE  or  GL_FASTEST  can  result in simple
			   linear interpolation of colors and/or texture coor-
			   dinates.

       GL_POINT_SMOOTH_HINT
			   Indicates   the  sampling  quality  of  antialiased
			   points.  If a larger filter	function  is  applied,
			   hinting  GL_NICEST  can  result in more pixel frag-
			   ments being generated during rasterization,

       GL_POLYGON_SMOOTH_HINT
			   Indicates the sampling quality of antialiased poly-
			   gons.   Hinting  GL_NICEST can result in more pixel
			   fragments being generated during rasterization,  if
			   a larger filter function is applied.

NOTES
       The interpretation of hints depends on the implementation.  Some imple-
       mentations ignore glHint settings.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated  if  either  target  or  mode  is  not  an
       accepted value.

       GL_INVALID_OPERATION  is  generated  if	glHint is executed between the
       execution of glBegin and the corresponding execution of glEnd.
