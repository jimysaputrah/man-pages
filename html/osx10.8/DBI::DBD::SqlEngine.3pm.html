NAME
       DBI::DBD::SqlEngine - Base class for DBI drivers without their own SQL
       engine

SYNOPSIS

	   sub driver
	   {
	       ...
	       my $drh = $proto-&gtSUPER::driver($attr);
	       ...
	       return $drh-&gt{class};
	       }

	   package DBD::myDriver::dr;

	   @ISA = qw(DBI::DBD::SqlEngine::dr);

	   sub data_sources { ... }
	   ...

DESCRIPTION
       DBI::DBD::SqlEngine abstracts the usage of SQL engines from the DBD.
       DBD authors can concentrate on the data retrieval they want to provide.

       It is strongly recommended that you read DBD::File::Developers and
       DBD::File::Roadmap, because many of the DBD::File API is provided by
       DBI::DBD::SqlEngine.

       Currently the API of DBI::DBD::SqlEngine is experimental and will
       likely change in the near future to provide the table meta data basics
       like DBD::File.

   Metadata
       The following attributes are handled by DBI itself and not by
       DBI::DBD::SqlEngine, thus they all work as expected:

	   Active
	   ActiveKids
	   CachedKids
	   CompatMode		  (Not used)
	   InactiveDestroy
	   AutoInactiveDestroy
	   Kids
	   PrintError
	   RaiseError
	   Warn 		  (Not used)

       The following DBI attributes are handled by DBI::DBD::SqlEngine:

       AutoCommit

       Always on.

       ChopBlanks

       Works.

       NUM_OF_FIELDS

       Valid after "$sth-&gtexecute".

       NUM_OF_PARAMS

       Valid after "$sth-&gtprepare".

       NAME

       Valid after "$sth-&gtexecute"; probably undef for Non-Select statements.

       NULLABLE

       Not really working, always returns an array ref of ones, as DBD::CSV
       does not verify input data. Valid after "$sth-&gtexecute"; undef for non-
       select statements.

       The following DBI attributes and methods are not supported:

       bind_param_inout
       CursorName
       LongReadLen
       LongTruncOk

       DBI::DBD::SqlEngine specific attributes

       In addition to the DBI attributes, you can use the following dbh
       attributes:

       sql_engine_version

       Contains the module version of this driver (readonly)

       sql_nano_version

       Contains the module version of DBI::SQL::Nano (readonly)

       sql_statement_version

       Contains the module version of SQL::Statement, if available (readonly)

       sql_handler

       Contains the SQL Statement engine, either DBI::SQL::Nano or
       SQL::Statement (readonly).

       sql_parser_object

       Contains an instantiated instance of SQL::Parser (readonly).  This is
       filled when used first time (only when used with SQL::Statement).

       sql_sponge_driver

       Contains an internally used DBD::Sponge handle (readonly).

       sql_valid_attrs

       Contains the list of valid attributes for each DBI::DBD::SqlEngine
       based driver (readonly).

       sql_readonly_attrs

       Contains the list of those attributes which are readonly (readonly).

       sql_identifier_case

       Contains how DBI::DBD::SqlEngine deals with non-quoted SQL identifiers:

	 * SQL_IC_UPPER (1) means all identifiers are internally converted
	   into upper-cased pendants
	 * SQL_IC_LOWER (2) means all identifiers are internally converted
	   into lower-cased pendants
	 * SQL_IC_MIXED (4) means all identifiers are taken as they are

       These conversions happen if (and only if) no existing identifier
       matches.  Once existing identifier is used as known.

       The SQL statement execution classes doesn't have to care, so don't
       expect "sql_identifier_case" affects column names in statements like

	 SELECT * FROM foo

       sql_quoted_identifier_case

       Contains how DBI::DBD::SqlEngine deals with quoted SQL identifiers
       (readonly). It's fixated to SQL_IC_SENSITIVE (3), which is interpreted
       as SQL_IC_MIXED.

       sql_flags

       Contains additional flags to instantiate an SQL::Parser. Because an
       SQL::Parser is instantiated only once, it's recommended to set this
       flag before any statement is executed.

       sql_dialect

       Controls the dialect understood by SQL::Parser. Possible values
       (delivery state of SQL::Statement):

	 * ANSI
	 * CSV
	 * AnyData

       Defaults to "CSV".  Because an SQL::Parser is instantiated only once
       and SQL::Parser doesn't allow to modify the dialect once instantiated,
       it's strongly recommended to set this flag before any statement is
       executed (best place is connect attribute hash).

   Where can I go for more help?
       For questions about installation or usage, please ask on the
       dbi-dev@perl.org mailing list.

       If you have a bug report, patch or suggestion, please open a new report
       ticket on CPAN, if there is not already one for the issue you want to
       report. Of course, you can mail any of the module maintainers, but it
       is less likely to be missed if it is reported on RT.

       Report tickets should contain a detailed description of the bug or
       enhancement request you want to report and at least an easy way to
       verify/reproduce the issue and any supplied fix. Patches are always
       welcome, too.
