NAME
       svnadmin - Subversion repository administration tool

SYNOPSIS
       svnadmin command /path/to/repos [options] [args]

OVERVIEW
       Subversion  is  a  version control system, which allows you to keep old
       versions of files and directories (usually source code), keep a log  of
       who, when, and why changes occurred, etc., like CVS, RCS or SCCS.  Sub-
       version keeps a single copy of the master sources.  This copy is called
       the  source  ``repository'';  it contains all the information to permit
       extracting previous versions of those files at any time.

       For more information about the Subversion project, visit http://subver-
       sion.apache.org.

       explanations of the svn, svnadmin, svnserve and svnlook programs,  his-
