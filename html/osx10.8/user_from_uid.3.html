PWCACHE(3)		 BSD Library Functions Manual		    PWCACHE(3)

NAME
     pwcache -- cache password and group entries

LIBRARY
     Standard C Library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
     #include &ltpwd.h&gt

     char *
     user_from_uid(uid_t uid, int nouser);

     #include &ltgrp.h&gt

     char *
     group_from_gid(gid_t gid, int nogroup);

DESCRIPTION
     The user_from_uid() function returns the user name associated with the
     argument uid.  The user name is cached so that multiple calls with the
     same uid do not require additional calls to getpwuid(3).  If there is no
     user associated with the uid, a pointer is returned to a string represen-
     tation of the uid, unless the argument nouser is non-zero, in which case
     a NULL pointer is returned.

     The group_from_gid() function returns the group name associated with the
     argument gid.  The group name is cached so that multiple calls with the
     same gid do not require additional calls to getgrgid(3).  If there is no
     group associated with the gid, a pointer is returned to a string repre-
     sentation of the gid, unless the argument nogroup is non-zero, in which
     case a NULL pointer is returned.

SEE ALSO
     getgrgid(3), getpwuid(3)

HISTORY
     The user_from_uid() and group_from_gid() functions first appeared in
     4.4BSD.
