NAME
       glDrawArraysInstanced - draw multiple instances of a range of elements

C SPECIFICATION
       void glDrawArraysInstanced(GLenum mode, GLint first, GLsizei count,
				  GLsizei primcount);

PARAMETERS
       mode
	   Specifies what kind of primitives to render. Symbolic constants
	   GL_POINTS, GL_LINE_STRIP, GL_LINE_LOOP, GL_LINES,
	   GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP, GL_TRIANGLE_FAN, GL_TRIANGLES
	   GL_LINES_ADJACENCY, GL_LINE_STRIP_ADJACENCY, GL_TRIANGLES_ADJACENCY
	   andGL_TRIANGLE_STRIP_ADJACENCY are accepted.

       first
	   Specifies the starting index in the enabled arrays.

       count
	   Specifies the number of indices to be rendered.

       primcount
	   Specifies the number of instances of the specified range of indices
	   to be rendered.

DESCRIPTION
       glDrawArraysInstanced behaves identically to glDrawArrays() except that
       primcount instances of the range of elements are executed and the value
       of the internal counter instanceID advances for each iteration.
       instanceID is an internal 32-bit integer counter that may be read by a
       vertex shader as gl_InstanceID.


       glDrawArraysInstanced has the same effect as:

	       if ( mode or count is invalid )
		   generate appropriate error
	       else {
		   for (int i = 0; i &lt primcount ; i++) {
		       instanceID = i;
		       glDrawArrays(mode, first, count);
		   }
		   instanceID = 0;
	       }


NOTES
       glDrawArraysInstanced is available only if the GL version is 3.1 or
       greater.


       GL_LINE_STRIP_ADJACENCY, GL_LINES_ADJACENCY,
       GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP_ADJACENCY and GL_TRIANGLES_ADJACENCY are available
       only if the GL version is 3.2 or greater.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if mode is not one of the accepted values.


       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if a geometry shader is active and
       mode is incompatible with the input primitive type of the geometry
       shader in the currently installed program object.


       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if count or primcount are negative.


       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if a non-zero buffer object name is
       bound to an enabled array and the buffer object's data store is
       currently mapped.
