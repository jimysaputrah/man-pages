NAME
       glGenBuffers - generate buffer object names

C SPECIFICATION
       void glGenBuffers(GLsizei n, GLuint * buffers);

PARAMETERS
       n
	   Specifies the number of buffer object names to be generated.

       buffers
	   Specifies an array in which the generated buffer object names are
	   stored.

DESCRIPTION
       glGenBuffers returns n buffer object names in buffers. There is no
       guarantee that the names form a contiguous set of integers; however, it
       is guaranteed that none of the returned names was in use immediately
       before the call to glGenBuffers.

       Buffer object names returned by a call to glGenBuffers are not returned
       by subsequent calls, unless they are first deleted with
       glDeleteBuffers().

       No buffer objects are associated with the returned buffer object names
       until they are first bound by calling glBindBuffer().

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if n is negative.

ASSOCIATED GETS
       glIsBuffer()

SEE ALSO
       glBindBuffer(), glDeleteBuffers(), glGet()
