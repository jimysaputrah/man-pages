NAME
       Net::Server::SIG - adpf - Safer signal handling

SYNOPSIS
	 use Net::Server::SIG qw(register_sig check_sigs);
	 use IO::Select ();
	 use POSIX qw(WNOHANG);

	 my $select = IO::Select->new();

	 register_sig(PIPE => 'IGNORE',
		      HUP  => 'DEFAULT',
		      USR1 => sub { print "I got a SIG $_[0]\n"; },
		      USR2 => sub { print "I got a SIG $_[0]\n"; },
		      CHLD => sub { 1 while (waitpid(-1, WNOHANG) > 0); },
		      );

	 ### add some handles to the select
	 $select->add(\*STDIN);

	 ### loop forever trying to stay alive
	 while ( 1 ){

	   ### do a timeout to see if any signals got passed us
	   ### while we were processing another signal
	   my @fh = $select->can_read(10);

	   my $key;
	   my $val;

	   ### this is the handler for safe (fine under unsafe also)
	   if( &check_sigs() ){
	     # or my @sigs = &check_sigs();
	     next unless @fh;
	   }

	   my $handle = $fh[@fh];

	   ### do something with the handle

	 }

DESCRIPTION
       Signals in Perl 5 are unsafe.  Some future releases may be able to fix
       some of this (ie Perl 5.8 or 6.0), but it would be nice to have some
       safe, portable signal handling now.  Clarification - much of the time,
       signals are safe enough.  However, if the program employs forking or
       becomes a daemon which can receive many simultaneous signals, then the
       signal handling of Perl is normally not sufficient for the task.

       Using a property of the select() function, Net::Server::SIG attempts to
       fix the unsafe problem.	If a process is blocking on select() any
       signal will short circuit the select.  Using this concept,
       Net::Server::SIG does the least work possible (changing one bit from 0
       to 1).  And depends upon the actual processing of the signals to take
       place immediately after the the select call via the "check_sigs"
       function.  See the example shown above and also see the sigtest.pl
       script located in the examples directory of this distribution.

FUNCTIONS
       "register_sig($SIG => \&code_ref)"
	   Takes key/value pairs where the key is the signal name, and the
	   argument is either a code ref, or the words 'DEFAULT' or 'IGNORE'.
	   The function register_sig must be used in conjuction with
	   check_sigs, and with a blocking select() function call --
	   otherwise, you will observe the registered signal mysteriously
	   vanish.

       "unregister_sig($SIG)"
	   Takes the name of a signal as an argument.  Calls register_sig with
	   a this signal name and 'DEFAULT' as arguments (same as
	   register_sig(SIG,'DEFAULT')

       "check_sigs()"
	   Checks to see if any registered signals have occured.  If so, it
	   will play the registered code ref for that signal.  Return value is
	   array containing any SIGNAL names that had occured.
