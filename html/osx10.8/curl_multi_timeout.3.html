NAME
       curl_multi_timeout - how long to wait for action before proceeding

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curl/curl.h>

       CURLMcode curl_multi_timeout(CURLM *multi_handle, long *timeout);

DESCRIPTION
       An   application   using   the  libcurl	multi  interface  should  call
       curl_multi_timeout(3) to figure out how long it should wait for	socket
       actions - at most - before proceeding.

       Proceeding means either doing the socket-style timeout action: call the
       curl_multi_socket_action(3) function with the sockfd  argument  set  to
       CURL_SOCKET_TIMEOUT,  or call curl_multi_perform(3) if you're using the
       simpler and older multi interface approach.

       The timeout value returned in the long timeout points to, is in	number
       of  milliseconds at this very moment. If 0, it means you should proceed
       immediately without waiting for anything. If it returns -1, there's  no
       timeout at all set.

       An application that uses the multi_socket API SHOULD not use this func-
       tion,  but  SHOULD  instead  use  curl_multi_setopt(3)  and  its  CURL-
       MOPT_TIMERFUNCTION option for proper and desired behavior.

       Note:  if libcurl returns a -1 timeout here, it just means that libcurl
       currently has no stored timeout value. You must not wait too long (more
       than a few seconds perhaps) before you call curl_multi_perform() again.

RETURN VALUE
       The standard CURLMcode for multi interface error codes.

TYPICAL USAGE
       Call curl_multi_timeout(3), then wait for action on  the  sockets.  You
       figure  out which sockets to wait for by calling curl_multi_fdset(3) or
       by a previous call to curl_multi_socket(3).

AVAILABILITY
       This function was added in libcurl 7.15.4.
