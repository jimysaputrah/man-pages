GIT-INDEX-PACK(1)		  Git Manual		     GIT-INDEX-PACK(1)



NAME
       git-index-pack - Build pack index file for an existing packed archive

SYNOPSIS
       git index-pack [-v] [-o &ltindex-file&gt] &ltpack-file&gt
       git index-pack --stdin [--fix-thin] [--keep] [-v] [-o &ltindex-file&gt]
			[&ltpack-file&gt]


DESCRIPTION
       Reads a packed archive (.pack) from the specified file, and builds a
       pack index file (.idx) for it. The packed archive together with the
       pack index can then be placed in the objects/pack/ directory of a git
       repository.

OPTIONS
       -v
	   Be verbose about what is going on, including progress status.

       -o &ltindex-file&gt
	   Write the generated pack index into the specified file. Without
	   this option the name of pack index file is constructed from the
	   name of packed archive file by replacing .pack with .idx (and the
	   program fails if the name of packed archive does not end with
	   .pack).

       --stdin
	   When this flag is provided, the pack is read from stdin instead and
	   a copy is then written to &ltpack-file&gt. If &ltpack-file&gt is not
	   specified, the pack is written to objects/pack/ directory of the
	   current git repository with a default name determined from the pack
	   content. If &ltpack-file&gt is not specified consider using --keep to
	   prevent a race condition between this process and git repack.

       --fix-thin
	   Fix a "thin" pack produced by git pack-objects --thin (see git-
	   pack-objects(1) for details) by adding the excluded objects the
	   deltified objects are based on to the pack. This option only makes
	   sense in conjunction with --stdin.

       --keep
	   Before moving the index into its final destination create an empty
	   .keep file for the associated pack file. This option is usually
	   necessary with --stdin to prevent a simultaneous git repack process
	   from deleting the newly constructed pack and index before refs can
	   be updated to use objects contained in the pack.

       --keep=&ltmsg&gt
	   Like --keep create a .keep file before moving the index into its
	   final destination, but rather than creating an empty file place
	   &ltmsg&gt followed by an LF into the .keep file. The &ltmsg&gt message can
	   later be searched for within all .keep files to locate any which
	   have outlived their usefulness.

       --index-version=&ltversion&gt[,&ltoffset&gt]
	   This is intended to be used by the test suite only. It allows to
	   force the version for the generated pack index, and to force 64-bit
	   index entries on objects located above the given offset.

       --strict
	   Die, if the pack contains broken objects or links.

       --threads=&ltn&gt
	   Specifies the number of threads to spawn when resolving deltas.
	   This requires that index-pack be compiled with pthreads otherwise
	   this option is ignored with a warning. This is meant to reduce
	   packing time on multiprocessor machines. The required amount of
	   memory for the delta search window is however multiplied by the
	   number of threads. Specifying 0 will cause git to auto-detect the
	   number of CPU's and use maximum 3 threads.

NOTE
       Once the index has been created, the list of object names is sorted and
       the SHA1 hash of that list is printed to stdout. If --stdin was also
       used then this is prefixed by either "pack\t", or "keep\t" if a new
       .keep file was successfully created. This is useful to remove a .keep
       file used as a lock to prevent the race with git repack mentioned
       above.
