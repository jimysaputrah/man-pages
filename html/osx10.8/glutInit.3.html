NAME
       glutInit - initialize the GLUT library.

SYNTAX
       #include &ltGLUT/glut.h&gt

       void glutInit(int *argcp, char **argv);

ARGUMENTS
       argcp	 A  pointer  to  the  program's  unmodified argc variable from
		 main.	Upon return, the value pointed to  by  argcp  will  be
		 updated,  because  glutInit extracts any command line options
		 intended for the GLUT library.

       argv	 The program's unmodified argv variable from main. Like argcp,
		 the  data  for argv will be updated because glutInit extracts
		 any command line options understood by the GLUT library.

DESCRIPTION
       glutInit will initialize the GLUT library and negotiate a session  with
       the window system. During this process, glutInit may cause the termina-
       tion of the GLUT program with an error message to the user if GLUT can-
       not  be	properly  initialized.	Examples of this situation include the
       failure to connect to the window system, the lack of window system sup-
       port for OpenGL, and invalid command line options.

       glutInit  also processes command line options, but the specific options
       parse are window system dependent.

X IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
       The X Window System specific options parsed by glutInit are as follows:

       -display DISPLAY
	       Specify the X server to connect to. If not specified, the value
	       of the DISPLAY environment variable is used.

       -geometry WxH+X+Y
	       Determines where window's should be created on the screen.  The
	       parameter following -geometry should be formatted as a standard
	       X geometry specification.  The effect of using this  option  is
	       to  change  the GLUT initial size and initial position the same
	       as if glutInitWindowSize or glutInitWindowPosition were	called
	       directly.

       -iconic Requests all top-level windows be created in an iconic state.

       -indirect
	       Force the use of indirect OpenGL rendering contexts.

       -direct Force  the use of direct OpenGL rendering contexts (not all GLX
	       implementations support direct  rendering  contexts).  A  fatal
	       error  is generated if direct rendering is not supported by the
	       OpenGL implementation.

	       If neither -indirect or -direct are used to force a  particular
	       behavior, GLUT will attempt to use direct rendering if possible
	       and otherwise fallback to indirect rendering.

       -gldebug
	       After processing callbacks and/or events, check	if  there  are
	       any  OpenGL  errors  by	calling  glGetError.   If  an error is
	       reported, print out a warning by looking up the error code with
	       gluErrorString.	 Using	this  option  is  helpful in detecting
	       OpenGL run-time errors.

       -sync   Enable synchronous X protocol transactions.  This option  makes
	       it easier to track down potential   X protocol errors.
