NAME
       PerlIO::gzip - Perl extension to provide a PerlIO layer to gzip/gunzip

SYNOPSIS
	 use PerlIO::gzip;
	 open FOO, "<:gzip", "file.gz" or die $!;
	 print while <FOO>; # And it will be uncompressed...

	 binmode FOO, ":gzip(none)" # Starts reading deflate stream from here on

DESCRIPTION
       PerlIO::gzip provides a PerlIO layer that manipulates files in the
       format used by the "gzip" program.  Compression and Decompression are
       implemented, but not together.  If you attempt to open a file for
       reading and writing the open will fail.

EXPORT
       PerlIO::gzip exports no subroutines or symbols, just a perl layer
       "gzip"

LAYER ARGUMENTS
       The "gzip" layer takes a comma separated list of arguments. 4 exclusive
       options choose the header checking mode:

       gzip
	   The default.  Expects a standard gzip file header for reading,
	   writes a standard gzip file header.

       none
	   Expects or writes no file header; assumes the file handle is
	   immediately a deflate stream (eg as would be found inside a "zip"
	   file)

       auto
	   Potentially dangerous. If the first two bytes match the "gzip"
	   header "\x1f\x8b" then a gzip header is assumed (and checked) else
	   a deflate stream is assumed.  No different from gzip on writing.

       autopop
	   Potentially dangerous. If the first two bytes match the "gzip"
	   header "\x1f\x8b" then a gzip header is assumed (and checked) else
	   the layer is silently popped.  This results in gzip files being
	   transparently decompressed, other files being treated normally.  Of
	   course, this has sides effects such as File::Copy becoming gunzip,
	   and File::Compare comparing the uncompressed contents of files.

	   In autopop mode Opening a handle for writing (or reading and
	   writing) will cause the gzip layer to automatically be popped.

       Optionally you can add this flag:

       lazy
	   For reading, defer header checking until the first read.  For
	   writing, don't write a header until the first buffer empty of
	   compressed data to disk.  (and don't write anything at all if no
	   data was written to the handle)

	   By default, gzip header checking is done before the "open" (or
	   "binmode") returns, so if an error is detected in the gzip header
	   the "open" or "binmode" will fail.  However, this will require
	   reading some data, or writing a header.  With lazy set on a file
	   opened for reading the check is deferred until the first read so
	   the "open" should always succeed, but any problems with the header
	   will cause an error on read.

	     open FOO, "<:gzip(lazy)", "file.gz" or die $!; # Dangerous.
	     while (<FOO>) {
	       print;
	     } # Whoa. Bad. You're not distinguishing between errors and EOF.

	   If you're not careful you won't spot the errors - like the example
	   above you'll think you got end of file.

	   lazy is ignored if you are in autopop mode.
