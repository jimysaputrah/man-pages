PPI::Token::End(3)    User Contributed Perl Documentation   PPI::Token::End(3)



NAME
       PPI::Token::End - Completely useless content after the __END__ tag

INHERITANCE
	 PPI::Token::End
	 isa PPI::Token
		 isa PPI::Element

DESCRIPTION
       If you've read PPI::Token::Whitespace, you should understand by now the
       concept of documents "floating in a sea of PPI::Token::Whitespace".

       Well it doesn't after the __END__ tag.

       Once you __END__, it's all over. Anything after that tag isn't even fit
       to be called whitespace. It just simply doesn't exist as far as perl
       (the interpreter) is concerned.

       That's not to say there isn't useful content. Most often people use the
       __END__ tag to hide POD content, so that perl never has to see it, and
       presumably providing some small speed up.

       That's fine. PPI likes POD. Any POD after the __END__ tag is parsed
       into valid PPI::Token::Pod tags as normal. This class, on the other
       hand, is for "what's after __END__ when it isn't POD".

       Basically, the completely worthless bits of the file :)

METHODS
       This class has no method beyond what is provided by its PPI::Token and
       PPI::Element parent classes.

SUPPORT
       See the support section in the main module.
