NAME
       git-remote-fd - Reflect smart transport stream back to caller

SYNOPSIS
       "fd::&ltinfd&gt[,&ltoutfd&gt][/&ltanything&gt]" (as URL)

DESCRIPTION
       This helper uses specified file descriptors to connect to a remote git
       server. This is not meant for end users but for programs and scripts
       calling git fetch, push or archive.

       If only &ltinfd&gt is given, it is assumed to be a bidirectional socket
       connected to remote git server (git-upload-pack, git-receive-pack or
       git-upload-achive). If both &ltinfd&gt and &ltoutfd&gt are given, they are
       assumed to be pipes connected to a remote git server (&ltinfd&gt being the
       inbound pipe and &ltoutfd&gt being the outbound pipe.

       It is assumed that any handshaking procedures have already been
       completed (such as sending service request for git://) before this
       helper is started.

       &ltanything&gt can be any string. It is ignored. It is meant for providing
       information to user in the URL in case that URL is displayed in some
       context.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       GIT_TRANSLOOP_DEBUG
	   If set, prints debugging information about various reads/writes.

EXAMPLES
       git fetch fd::17 master
	   Fetch master, using file descriptor #17 to communicate with
	   git-upload-pack.

       git fetch fd::17/foo master
	   Same as above.

       git push fd::7,8 master (as URL)
	   Push master, using file descriptor #7 to read data from
	   git-receive-pack and file descriptor #8 to write data to same
	   service.

       git push fd::7,8/bar master
	   Same as above.
