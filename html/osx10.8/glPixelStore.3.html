NAME
       glPixelStoref, glPixelStorei - set pixel storage modes


C SPECIFICATION
       void glPixelStoref( GLenum pname,
			   GLfloat param )
       void glPixelStorei( GLenum pname,
			   GLint param )


PARAMETERS
       pname  Specifies  the  symbolic	name  of the parameter to be set.  Six
	      values  affect  the  packing  of	 pixel	 data	into   memory:
	      GL_PACK_SWAP_BYTES,    GL_PACK_LSB_FIRST,    GL_PACK_ROW_LENGTH,
	      GL_PACK_IMAGE_HEIGHT,  GL_PACK_SKIP_PIXELS,   GL_PACK_SKIP_ROWS,
	      GL_PACK_SKIP_IMAGES, and GL_PACK_ALIGNMENT.  Six more affect the
	      unpacking  of  pixel  data  from	memory:  GL_UNPACK_SWAP_BYTES,
	      GL_UNPACK_LSB_FIRST,			 GL_UNPACK_ROW_LENGTH,
	      GL_UNPACK_IMAGE_HEIGHT,			GL_UNPACK_SKIP_PIXELS,
	      GL_UNPACK_SKIP_ROWS,	    GL_UNPACK_SKIP_IMAGES,	   and
	      GL_UNPACK_ALIGNMENT.

       param  Specifies the value that pname is set to.

DESCRIPTION
       glPixelStore sets pixel storage modes that affect the operation of sub-
       sequent glDrawPixels and glReadPixels as well as the unpacking of poly-
       gon stipple patterns (see glPolygonStipple),  bitmaps  (see  glBitmap),
       texture	 patterns   (see   glTexImage1D,  glTexImage2D,  glTexImage3D,
       glTexSubImage1D, glTexSubImage2D, glTexSubImage3D).   Additionally,  if
       the  GL_ARB_imaging  extension is supported, pixel storage modes affect
       convolution filters (see glConvolutionFilter1D,	glConvolutionFilter2D,
       and   glSeparableFilter2D,   color   table   (see   glColorTable,   and
       glColorSubTable, and unpacking histogram (See glHistogram), and	minmax
       (See glMinmax) data.

       pname  is  a  symbolic constant indicating the parameter to be set, and
       param is the new value.	Six of the twelve  storage  parameters	affect
       how pixel data is returned to client memory.  They are as follows:

       GL_PACK_SWAP_BYTES
		 If  true, byte ordering for multibyte color components, depth
		 components, color indices, or stencil	indices  is  reversed.
		 That  is,  if a four-byte component consists of bytes b0, b1,
		 b2, b2  it  is  stored  in  memory  as  b3,  b2,  b1,	b0  if
		 GL_PACK_SWAP_BYTES is true.  GL_PACK_SWAP_BYTES has no effect
		 on the memory order of components within a pixel, only on the
		 order	of  bytes  within components or indices.  For example,
		 the three components of a GL_RGB   pixel  are	always	stored
		 with  red  first, green second, and blue third, regardless of
		 the value of GL_PACK_SWAP_BYTES.

       GL_PACK_LSB_FIRST
		 If true, bits are ordered within a byte from  least  signifi-
		 cant  to  most  significant; otherwise, the first bit in each
		 byte is the most significant one.  This parameter is signifi-
		 cant for bitmap data only.

       GL_PACK_ROW_LENGTH
		 If  greater  than 0, GL_PACK_ROW_LENGTH defines the number of
		 pixels in a row.  If the first pixel of a row	is  placed  at
		 location p in memory, then the location of the first pixel of
		 the next row is obtained by skipping


			     k = nl for s&gt=a, (a/s)(snl/a) for s&lta

		 components or indices, where n is the number of components or
		 indices  in  a  pixel,  l is the number of pixels in a row (-
		 GL_PACK_ROW_LENGTH if it is greater than 0, the  width  argu-
		 ment  to  the	pixel  routine	otherwise),  a is the value of
		 GL_PACK_ALIGNMENT, and s is the size, in bytes, of  a	single
		 component (if a &lt s, then it is as if a = s).	In the case of
		 1-bit values, the location of the next  row  is  obtained  by
		 skipping


					k = 8a (nl/8a)


		 components or indices.

		 The word component in this description refers to the nonindex
		 values red, green, blue, alpha, and depth.  Storage   GL_RGB,
		 for  example, has three components per pixel: first red, then
		 green, and finally blue.

       GL_PACK_IMAGE_HEIGHT
		 If greater than 0, GL_PACK_IMAGE_HEIGHT defines the number of
		 pixels  in  an image three-dimensional texture volume.  Where
		 ``image'' is defined by all pixels  sharing  the  same  third
		 dimension  index.   If  the first pixel of a row is placed at
		 location p in memory, then the location of the first pixel of
		 the next row is obtained by skipping


			    k = nlh for s&gt=a, (a/s)(snlh/a) for s&lta


		 components or indices, where n is the number of components or
		 indices in a pixel, l is the number of pixels	in  a  row  (-
		 GL_PACK_ROW_LENGTH  if it is greater than 0,  the width argu-
		 ment to glTexImage3d otherwise), h is the number of rows in a
		 pixel	image  (GL_PACK_IMAGE_HEIGHT  if it is greater than 0,
		 the height arguemnt to the glTexImage3D routine otherwise), a
		 is  the  value  of  GL_PACK_ALIGNMENT,  and s is the size, in
		 bytes, of a single component (if  a &lt s, then it is as if a =
		 s).

		 The word component in this description refers to the nonindex
		 values red, green, blue, alpha, and depth.  Storage   GL_RGB,
		 for  example, has three components per pixel: first red, then
		 green, and finally blue.

       GL_PACK_SKIP_PIXELS, GL_PACK_SKIP_ROWS, and GL_PACK_SKIP_IMAGES
		 These values are provided as a convenience to the programmer;
		 they  provide no functionality that cannot be duplicated sim-
		 ply by incrementing the pointer passed to glReadPixels.  Set-
		 ting  GL_PACK_SKIP_PIXELS  to i is equivalent to incrementing
		 the pointer by i n components or indices, where n is the num-
		 ber   of  components  or  indices  in	each  pixel.   Setting
		 GL_PACK_SKIP_ROWS to j  is  equivalent  to  incrementing  the
		 pointer  by  j m components or indices, where m is the number
		 of components or indices per row, as  just  computed  in  the
		 GL_PACK_ROW_LENGTH section.  Setting GL_PACK_SKIP_IMAGES to k
		 is equivalent to incrementing the pointer by k p, where p  is
		 the number of components or indices per image, as computed in
		 the GL_PACK_IMAGE_HEIGHT section.

       GL_PACK_ALIGNMENT
		 Specifies the alignment requirements for the  start  of  each
		 pixel row in memory.  The allowable values are 1 (byte-align-
		 ment), 2 (rows aligned  to  even-numbered  bytes),  4	(word-
		 alignment), and 8 (rows start on double-word boundaries).

       The other six of the twelve storage parameters affect how pixel data is
       read  from  client  memory.    These   values   are   significant   for
       glDrawPixels,	   glTexImage1D,      glTexImage2D,	 glTexImage3D,
       glTexSubImage1D,  glTexSubImage2D,   glTexSubImage3D,   glBitmap,   and
       glPolygonStipple.

       Additionally,   if   the   GL_ARB_imaging   extension   is   supported,
       glColorTable,	      glColorSubTable,		glConvolutionFilter1D,
       glConvolutionFilter2D, and glSeparableFilter2D.	They are as follows:

       GL_UNPACK_SWAP_BYTES
	      If  true,  byte  ordering  for multibyte color components, depth
	      components, color indices, or stencil indices is reversed.  That
	      is,  if  a four-byte component consists of bytes b0, b1, b2, b3,
	      it   is	taken	from   memory	as   b3,   b2,	 b1,   b0   if
	      GL_UNPACK_SWAP_BYTES   is  true.	 GL_UNPACK_SWAP_BYTES  has  no
	      effect on the memory order of components within a pixel, only on
	      the  order  of bytes within components or indices.  For example,
	      the three components of a GL_RGB	pixel are always  stored  with
	      red first, green second, and blue third, regardless of the value
	      of GL_UNPACK_SWAP_BYTES.

       GL_UNPACK_LSB_FIRST
	      If true, bits are ordered within a byte from  least  significant
	      to  most	significant;  otherwise, the first bit in each byte is
	      the most significant one.  This  is  relevant  only  for	bitmap
	      data.

       GL_UNPACK_ROW_LENGTH
	      If  greater  than  0, GL_UNPACK_ROW_LENGTH defines the number of
	      pixels in a row.	If the first pixel of a row is placed at loca-
	      tion  p  in  memory, then the location of the first pixel of the
	      next row is obtained by skipping


			   k = nl for s&gt=a, (a/s)(snl/a) for s&lta


	      components or indices, where n is the number  of	components  or
	      indices  in  a  pixel,  l  is  the  number of pixels in a row (-
	      GL_UNPACK_ROW_LENGTH if it is greater than 0, the width argument
	      to   the	 pixel	 routine   otherwise),	 a  is	the  value  of
	      GL_UNPACK_ALIGNMENT, and s is the size, in bytes,  of  a	single
	      component  (if   a &lt s, then it is as if a = s).	In the case of
	      1-bit values, the location of the next row is obtained by  skip-
	      ping


				       k = 8a (nl/8a)


	      components or indices.

	      The  word  component  in this description refers to the nonindex
	      values red, green, blue, alpha, and depth.  Storage  GL_RGB, for
	      example,	has three components per pixel: first red, then green,
	      and finally blue.

       GL_UNPACK_IMAGE_HEIGHT
	      If greater than 0, GL_UNPACK_IMAGE_HEIGHT defines the number  of
	      pixels in an image of a three-dimensional texture volume.  Where
	      ``image'' is defined by all pixel sharing the same third	dimen-
	      sion index.  If the first pixel of a row is placed at location p
	      in memory, then the location of the first pixel of the next  row
	      is obtained by skipping


			  k = nlh for s&gt=a, (a/s)(snlh/a) for s&lta


	      components  or  indices,	where n is the number of components or
	      indices in a pixel, l is the  number  of	pixels	in  a  row  (-
	      GL_UNPACK_ROW_LENGTH if it is greater than 0, the width argument
	      to glTexImage3D otherwise), h is the number of rows in an  image
	      (GL_UNPACK_IMAGE_HEIGHT  if  it  is  greater  than 0, the height
	      argument	to  glTexImage3D  otherwise),  a  is  the   value   of
	      GL_UNPACK_ALIGNMENT,  and  s  is the size, in bytes, of a single
	      component (if  a &lt s, then it is as if a = s).

	      The word component in this description refers  to  the  nonindex
	      values red, green, blue, alpha, and depth.  Storage  GL_RGB, for
	      example, has three components per pixel: first red, then	green,
	      and finally blue.

       GL_UNPACK_SKIP_PIXELS and GL_UNPACK_SKIP_ROWS
	      These  values  are  provided as a convenience to the programmer;
	      they provide no  functionality  that  cannot  be	duplicated  by
	      incrementing  the  pointer passed to glDrawPixels, glTexImage1D,
	      glTexImage2D,  glTexSubImage1D,  glTexSubImage2D,  glBitmap,  or
	      glPolygonStipple.  Setting GL_UNPACK_SKIP_PIXELS to i is equiva-
	      lent to incrementing the pointer by i n components  or  indices,
	      where  n	is  the number of components or indices in each pixel.
	      Setting GL_UNPACK_SKIP_ROWS to j is equivalent  to  incrementing
	      the  pointer by j k components or indices, where k is the number
	      of components or indices	per  row,  as  just  computed  in  the
	      GL_UNPACK_ROW_LENGTH section.

       GL_UNPACK_ALIGNMENT
	      Specifies the alignment requirements for the start of each pixel
	      row in memory.  The allowable values are 1  (byte-alignment),  2
	      (rows aligned to even-numbered bytes), 4 (word-alignment), and 8
	      (rows start on double-word boundaries).

       The following table gives the type, initial value, and range  of  valid
       values for each storage parameter that can be set with glPixelStore.


	pname		       Type    Initial Valid
					Value  Range
	GL_PACK_SWAP_BYTES     boolean false   true or false
	GL_PACK_LSB_FIRST      boolean false   true or false
	GL_PACK_ROW_LENGTH     integer 0       [0,inf]
	GL_PACK_IMAGE_HEIGHT   integer 0       [0,inf]
	GL_PACK_SKIP_ROWS      integer 0       [0,inf]
	GL_PACK_SKIP_PIXELS    integer 0       [0,inf]
	GL_PACK_SKIP_IMAGES    integer 0       [0,inf]

	GL_UNPACK_ALIGNMENT    integer 4       1, 2, 4, or 8


       glPixelStoref  can  be  used  to set any pixel store parameter.	If the
       parameter type is boolean, then if param is 0, the parameter is	false;
       otherwise  it  is  set  to true.  If pname is a integer type parameter,
       param is rounded to the nearest integer.

       Likewise, glPixelStorei can also be used to set any of the pixel  store
       parameters.  Boolean parameters are set to false if param is 0 and true
       otherwise.

NOTES
       The pixel storage modes	in  effect  when  glDrawPixels,  glReadPixels,
       glTexImage1D,	  glTexImage2D,     glTexImage3D,     glTexSubImage1D,
       glTexSubImage2D,  glTexSubImage3D,  glBitmap,  or  glPolygonStipple  is
       placed  in  a  display  list control the interpretation of memory data.
       Likewise, if the GL_ARB_imaging extension is supported, the pixel stor-
       age    modes    in    effect    when   glColorTable,   glColorSubTable,
       glConvolutionFilter1D, glConvolutionFilter2D, of glSeparableFilter2D is
       placed  in  a  display  list control the intrepretation of memory data.
       The pixel storage modes in effect when a display list is  executed  are
       not significant.

       Pixel  storage  modes  are client state and must be pushed and restored
       using
       glPushClientAttrib and glPopClientAttrib.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if pname is not an accepted value.

       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if a negative row length, pixel skip,  or
       row skip value is specified, or if alignment is specified as other than
       1, 2, 4, or 8.

       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if glPixelStore is  executed  between
       the execution of glBegin and the corresponding execution of glEnd.
