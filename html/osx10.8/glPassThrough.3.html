NAME
       glPassThrough - place a marker in the feedback buffer


C SPECIFICATION
       void glPassThrough( GLfloat token )


PARAMETERS
       token  Specifies  a  marker  value  to be placed in the feedback buffer
	      following a GL_PASS_THROUGH_TOKEN.

DESCRIPTION
       Feedback is a  GL  render  mode.   The  mode  is  selected  by  calling
       glRenderMode  with  GL_FEEDBACK.   When	the GL is in feedback mode, no
       pixels are produced by rasterization.  Instead, information about prim-
       itives  that  would have been rasterized is fed back to the application
       using the GL.  See the glFeedbackBuffer reference page for  a  descrip-
       tion of the feedback buffer and the values in it.

       glPassThrough inserts a user-defined marker in the feedback buffer when
       it is executed in feedback mode.  token is returned as  if  it  were  a
       primitive;  it  is  indicated  with  its  own unique identifying value:
       GL_PASS_THROUGH_TOKEN.	The  order  of	glPassThrough  commands   with
       respect to the specification of graphics primitives is maintained.

NOTES
       glPassThrough is ignored if the GL is not in feedback mode.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_OPERATION  is generated if glPassThrough is executed between
       the execution of glBegin and the corresponding execution of glEnd.

ASSOCIATED GETS
       glGet with argument GL_RENDER_MODE
