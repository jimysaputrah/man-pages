NAME
       SQL::Abstract::Tree - Represent SQL as an AST

SYNOPSIS
	my $sqla_tree = SQL::Abstract::Tree-&gtnew({ profile =&gt 'console' });

	print $sqla_tree-&gtformat('SELECT * FROM foo WHERE foo.a &gt 2');

	# SELECT *
	#   FROM foo
	#   WHERE foo.a &gt 2

METHODS
   new
	my $sqla_tree = SQL::Abstract::Tree-&gtnew({ profile =&gt 'console' });

	$args = {
	  profile =&gt 'console',      # predefined profile to use (default: 'none')
	  fill_in_placeholders =&gt 1, # true for placeholder population
	  placeholder_surround =&gt    # The strings that will be wrapped around
		     [GREEN, RESET], # populated placeholders if the above is set
	  indent_string =&gt ' ',      # the string used when indenting
	  indent_amount =&gt 2,	     # how many of above string to use for a single
				     # indent level
	  newline	=&gt "\n",     # string for newline
	  colormap	=&gt {
	    select =&gt [RED, RESET], # a pair of strings defining what to surround
				    # the keyword with for colorization
	    # ...
	  },
	  indentmap	=&gt {
	    select	  =&gt 0,     # A zero means that the keyword will start on
				    # a new line
	    from	  =&gt 1,     # Any other positive integer means that after
	    on		  =&gt 2,     # said newline it will get that many indents
	    # ...
	  },
	}

       Returns a new SQL::Abstract::Tree object.  All arguments are optional.

       profiles

       There are four predefined profiles, "none", "console",
       "console_monochrome", and "html".  Typically a user will probably just
       use "console" or "console_monochrome", but if something about a profile
       bothers you, merely use the profile and override the parts that you
       don't like.

   format
	$sqlat-&gtformat('SELECT * FROM bar WHERE x = ?', [1])

       Takes $sql and "\@bindargs".

       Returns a formatting string based on the string passed in

   parse
	$sqlat-&gtparse('SELECT * FROM bar WHERE x = ?')

       Returns a "tree" representing passed in SQL.  Please do not depend on
       the structure of the returned tree.  It may be stable at some point,
       but not yet.

   unparse
	$sqlat-&gtparse($tree_structure, \@bindargs)

       Transform "tree" into SQL, applying various transforms on the way.

   format_keyword
	$sqlat-&gtformat_keyword('SELECT')

       Currently this just takes a keyword and puts the "colormap" stuff
       around it.  Later on it may do more and allow for coderef based
       transforms.

   pad_keyword
	my ($before, $after) = @{$sqlat-&gtpad_keyword('SELECT')};

       Returns whitespace to be inserted around a keyword.

   fill_in_placeholder
	my $value = $sqlat-&gtfill_in_placeholder(\@bindargs)

       Removes last arg from passed arrayref and returns it, surrounded with
       the values in placeholder_surround, and then surrounded with single
       quotes.

   indent
       Returns as many indent strings as indent amounts times the first
       argument.
