NAME
       DBIx::Class::DB - (DEPRECATED) classdata schema component

DESCRIPTION
       This class is designed to support the Class::DBI connection-as-
       classdata style for DBIx::Class. You are *strongly* recommended to use
       a DBIx::Class::Schema instead; DBIx::Class::DB will not undergo new
       development and will be moved to being a CDBICompat-only component
       before 1.0. In order to discourage further use, documentation has been
       removed as of 0.08000
