NAME
       DROP_CAST - remove a cast

SYNOPSIS
       DROP CAST [ IF EXISTS ] (source_type AS target_type) [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ]

DESCRIPTION
       DROP CAST removes a previously defined cast.

       To be able to drop a cast, you must own the source or the target data
       type. These are the same privileges that are required to create a cast.

PARAMETERS
       IF EXISTS
	   Do not throw an error if the cast does not exist. A notice is
	   issued in this case.

       source_type
	   The name of the source data type of the cast.

       target_type
	   The name of the target data type of the cast.

       CASCADE, RESTRICT
	   These key words do not have any effect, since there are no
	   dependencies on casts.

EXAMPLES
       To drop the cast from type text to type int:

	   DROP CAST (text AS int);

COMPATIBILITY
       The DROP CAST command conforms to the SQL standard.
