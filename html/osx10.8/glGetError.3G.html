NAME
       glGetError - return error information

C SPECIFICATION
       GLenum glGetError(void);

DESCRIPTION
       glGetError returns the value of the error flag. Each detectable error
       is assigned a numeric code and symbolic name. When an error occurs, the
       error flag is set to the appropriate error code value. No other errors
       are recorded until glGetError is called, the error code is returned,
       and the flag is reset to GL_NO_ERROR. If a call to glGetError returns
       GL_NO_ERROR, there has been no detectable error since the last call to
       glGetError, or since the GL was initialized.

       To allow for distributed implementations, there may be several error
       flags. If any single error flag has recorded an error, the value of
       that flag is returned and that flag is reset to GL_NO_ERROR when
       glGetError is called. If more than one flag has recorded an error,
       glGetError returns and clears an arbitrary error flag value. Thus,
       glGetError should always be called in a loop, until it returns
       GL_NO_ERROR, if all error flags are to be reset.

       Initially, all error flags are set to GL_NO_ERROR.

       The following errors are currently defined:

       GL_NO_ERROR
	   No error has been recorded. The value of this symbolic constant is
	   guaranteed to be 0.

       GL_INVALID_ENUM
	   An unacceptable value is specified for an enumerated argument. The
	   offending command is ignored and has no other side effect than to
	   set the error flag.

       GL_INVALID_VALUE
	   A numeric argument is out of range. The offending command is
	   ignored and has no other side effect than to set the error flag.

       GL_INVALID_OPERATION
	   The specified operation is not allowed in the current state. The
	   offending command is ignored and has no other side effect than to
	   set the error flag.

       GL_INVALID_FRAMEBUFFER_OPERATION
	   The framebuffer object is not complete. The offending command is
	   ignored and has no other side effect than to set the error flag.

       GL_OUT_OF_MEMORY
	   There is not enough memory left to execute the command. The state
	   of the GL is undefined, except for the state of the error flags,
	   after this error is recorded.

       When an error flag is set, results of a GL operation are undefined only
       if GL_OUT_OF_MEMORY has occurred. In all other cases, the command
       generating the error is ignored and has no effect on the GL state or
       frame buffer contents. If the generating command returns a value, it
       returns 0. If glGetError itself generates an error, it returns 0.
