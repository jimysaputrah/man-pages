NAME
       scanw, wscanw, mvscanw, mvwscanw, vwscanw, vw_scanw - convert formatted
       input from a curses window

SYNOPSIS
       #include &ltcurses.h&gt

       int scanw(char *fmt, ...);
       int wscanw(WINDOW *win, char *fmt, ...);
       int mvscanw(int y, int x, char *fmt, ...);
       int mvwscanw(WINDOW *win, int y, int x, char *fmt, ...);
       int vw_scanw(WINDOW *win, char *fmt, va_list varglist);
       int vwscanw(WINDOW *win, char *fmt, va_list varglist);

DESCRIPTION
       The scanw, wscanw and mvscanw routines  are  analogous  to  scanf  [see
       scanf(3)].   The  effect  of  these  routines is as though wgetstr were
       called on the  window,  and  the  resulting  line  used	as  input  for
       sscanf(3).   Fields which do not map to a variable in the fmt field are
       lost.

       The vwscanw and vw_scanw routines are analogous to vscanf.   They  per-
       form  a wscanw using a variable argument list.  The third argument is a
       va_list, a pointer to a list of arguments, as defined in &ltstdarg.h&gt.

RETURN VALUE
       vwscanw returns ERR on failure and an integer equal to  the  number  of
       fields scanned on success.

       Applications  may  use the return value from the scanw, wscanw, mvscanw
       and mvwscanw routines to determine the  number  of  fields  which  were
       mapped in the call.

PORTABILITY
       The  XSI Curses standard, Issue 4 describes these functions.  The func-
       tion vwscanw is marked TO BE WITHDRAWN, and is  to  be  replaced  by  a
       function  vw_scanw  using  the  &ltstdarg.h&gt  interface.  The Single Unix
       Specification, Version 2 states that vw_scanw  is preferred to  vwscanw
       since  the  latter requires including &ltvarargs.h&gt, which cannot be used
       in the same file as &ltstdarg.h&gt.	This  implementation  uses  &ltstdarg.h&gt
       for both, because that header is included in &ltcurses.h&gt.

       Both  XSI and The Single Unix Specification, Version 2 state that these
       functions return ERR or OK.  Since the underlying scanf can return  the
       number  of  items scanned, and the SVr4 code was documented to use this
       feature, this is probably an editing error which was introduced in XSI,
       rather  than  being  done  intentionally.  Portable applications should
       only test if the return value is ERR, since  the  OK  value  (zero)  is
       likely  to be misleading.  One possible way to get useful results would
       be to use a "%n" conversion at the end of the format string  to	ensure
       that something was processed.
