NAME
       form_field_buffer - field buffer control

SYNOPSIS
       #include <form.h>
       int set_field_buffer(FIELD *field, int buf, const char *value);
       char *field_buffer(const FIELD *field, int buffer);
       int set_field_status(FIELD *field, bool status);
       bool field_status(const FIELD *field);
       int set_max_field(FIELD *field, int max);

DESCRIPTION
       The  function  set_field_buffer	sets  the numbered buffer of the given
       field to contain a given string:

	  -  Buffer 0 is the displayed value of the field.

	  -  Other numbered buffers may be allocated by  applications  through
	     the nbuf argument of (see form_field_new(3X)) but are not manipu-
	     lated by the forms library.

       The function field_buffer returns a pointer  to	the  contents  of  the
       given numbered buffer:

	  -  The  buffer  contents always have the same length, and are padded
	     with trailing spaces as needed to ensure this length is the same.

	  -  The  buffer  may  contain leading spaces, depending on how it was
	     set.

	  -  The buffer contents are set with set_field_buffer, or as  a  side
	     effect of any editing operations on the corresponding field.

	  -  Editing  operations  are  based  on the window which displays the
	     field, rather than a string.  The window contains only  printable
	     characters, and is filled with blanks.  If you want the raw data,
	     you must write your own routine that copies the value out of  the
	     buffer and removes the leading and trailing spaces.

	  -  Because  editing  operations  change the content of the buffer to
	     correspond to the window, you should not rely  on	using  buffers
	     for long-term storage of form data.

       The function set_field_status sets the associated status flag of field;
       field_status gets the current value.  The  status  flag	is  set  to  a
       nonzero value whenever the field changes.

       The  function  set_max_field sets the maximum size for a dynamic field.
       An argument of 0 turns off any maximum size threshold for that field.

RETURN VALUE
       The field_buffer function returns NULL on error.  It sets errno accord-
       ing to their success:

       E_OK The routine succeeded.

       E_BAD_ARGUMENT
	    Routine detected an incorrect or out-of-range argument.

       The field_status function returns TRUE or FALSE.

       The remaining routines return one of the following:

       E_OK The routine succeeded.

       E_SYSTEM_ERROR
	    System error occurred (see errno).

       E_BAD_ARGUMENT
	    Routine detected an incorrect or out-of-range argument.

       descriptions of the entry points.

NOTES
       The header file <form.h> automatically includes the header file

       When configured for wide-characters, field_buffer returns a pointer  to
       temporary  storage  (allocated and freed by the library).  The applica-
       tion should not attempt to modify the data.  It will be	freed  on  the
       next call to field_buffer to return the same buffer.  <curses.h>.

PORTABILITY
       These  routines emulate the System V forms library.  They were not sup-
       ported on Version 7 or BSD versions.
