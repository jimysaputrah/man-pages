POSIX_SPAWNATTR_INIT(3)  BSD Library Functions Manual  POSIX_SPAWNATTR_INIT(3)

NAME
     posix_spawnattr_init posix_spawnattr_destroy -- initialize or destroy a
     spawn attributes object

SYNOPSIS
     #include &ltspawn.h&gt

     int
     posix_spawnattr_init(posix_spawnattr_t *attr);

     int
     posix_spawnattr_destroy(posix_spawnattr_t *attr);

DESCRIPTION
     The posix_spawnattr_init() function initializes the object referenced by
     attr, to an empty set of spawn attributes for subsequent use in a call to
     posix_spawn(2) or posix_spawnp(2).

     A posix_spawnattr_t object is an opaque type that is used to collect set
     of spawn attributes specified by calls to posix_spawnattr_setflags(3),
     posix_spawnattr_setpgroup(3), posix_spawnattr_setsigdefault(3),
     posix_spawnattr_setsigmask(3), posix_spawnattr_setbinpref_np(3),
     posix_spawnattr_setspecialport_np(3), or
     posix_spawnattr_setexceptionports_np(3) such that once the spawn opera-
     tion is complete, the child process will have a different set of
     attributes than the parent.  The order of these operations is unspecified
     and may change; programs should not depend on their ordering.

     The posix_spawnattr_destroy() function destroys the object referenced by
     attr which was previously intialized by posix_spawnattr_init(), returning
     any resources obtained at the time of initialization to the system for
     subsequent reuse.	A posix_spawnattr_t may be reinitialized after having
     been destroyed, but must not be reused after destruction, unless it has
     been reinitialized.

RETURN VALUES
     On success, these functions return 0; on failure they return an error
     number from &lterrno.h&gt.

ERRORS
     The posix_spawnattr_init() and posix_spawnattr_destroy() functions will
     fail and return an error if:

     [ENOMEM]		Insufficient resources to initialize the
			posix_spawnattr_t object.

     [EINVAL]		The posix_spawnattr_t being destroyed is invalid.
