NAME
       Net::LDAP::LDIF - LDIF reading and writing

SYNOPSIS
	use Net::LDAP::LDIF;

	$ldif = Net::LDAP::LDIF->new( "file.ldif", "r", onerror => 'undef' );
	while( not $ldif->eof ( ) ) {
	  $entry = $ldif->read_entry ( );
	  if ( $ldif->error ( ) ) {
	    print "Error msg: ", $ldif->error ( ), "\n";
	    print "Error lines:\n", $ldif->error_lines ( ), "\n";
	  } else {
	    # do stuff
	  }
	}
	$ldif->done ( );

DESCRIPTION
       Net::LDAP::LDIF provides a means to convert between Net::LDAP::Entry
       objects and LDAP entries represented in LDIF format files. Reading and
       writing are supported and may manipulate single entries or lists of
       entries.

       As when reading an entire file into memory with perl normally, take
       into account the possibility of memory use when loading an LDIF file in
       one go.

CONSTRUCTOR
       new ( FILE )
	   Open the file read-only. "FILE" may be the name of a file or an
	   already open filehandle. If "FILE" begins or ends with a "|" then
	   "FILE" will be passed directly to "open".

       new ( FILE, MODE, OPTIONS )
	   Open the file with the given "MODE", eg "w" or "a". "FILE" may be
	   the name of a file or an already open filehandle. If "FILE" begins
	   or ends with a "|" then "FILE" will be passed directly to "open".

	   encode => 'none' | 'canonical' | 'base64'
	       Some DN values in LDIF cannot be written verbatim and have to
	       be encoded in some way:

	       'none'
		   The default.

	       'canonical'
		   See "canonical_dn" in Net::LDAP::Util.

	       'base64'
		   Use base64.

	   onerror => 'die' | 'warn' | undef
	       Specify what happens when an error is detected.

	       'die'
		   "Net::LDAP::LDIF" will croak with an appropriate message.

	       'warn'
		   "Net::LDAP::LDIF" will warn with an appropriate message.

	       undef
		   "Net::LDAP::LDIF" will warn with an appropriate message if
		   "-w" is in effect.  The method that was called will return
		   "undef".

	   change => 1
	       Write entry changes to the LDIF file instead of the entries
	       itself.	I.e. write LDAP operations acting on the entries to
	       the file instead of the entries contents.

	   lowercase => 1
	       Convert attribute names to lowercase when writing.

	   sort => 1
	       Sort attribute names when writing entries according to the
	       rule: objectclass first then all other attributes
	       alphabetically sorted

	   version => '1'
	       Set the LDIF version to write to the resulting LDIF file.

	       According to RFC 2849 currently the only legal value for this
	       option is 1.

	       When this option is set Net::LDAP::LDIF tries to adhere more
	       strictly to the LDIF specification in RFC2489 in a few places.

	       The default is undef meaning no version information is written
	       to the LDIF file.

	   wrap => 78
	       Number of columns where output line wrapping shall occur.

	       Default is 78. Setting it to 40 or lower inhibits wrapping.

	   raw => REGEX
	       Use REGEX to denote the names of attributes that are to be
	       considered binary in search results.

	       When running on Perl 5.8 and this option is given Net::LDAP
	       converts all values of attributes not matching this REGEX into
	       Perl UTF-8 strings so that the regular Perl operators (pattern
	       matching, ...) can operate as one expects even on strings with
	       international characters.

	       If this option is not given or the version of Perl Net::LDAP is
	       running on is too old strings are encodeed the same as in
	       earlier versions of perl-ldap.

	       Example: raw => qr/(?i:^jpegPhoto|;binary)/

METHODS
       read_entry ( )
	   Read one entry from the file and return it as a "Net::LDAP::Entry"
	   object.

       eof ( )
	   Returns true when the end of the file is reached.

       write_entry ( ENTRIES )
	   Write the entries to the LDIF file.

       write_version ( )
	   If the object's version is defined, this method allows to
	   explicitely write the version before an entry is written.

	   If  not called explicitely, it gets called automatically when
	   writing the first entry.

       version ( [ VERSION ] )
	   If called without arguments it returns the version of the LDIF file
	   or undef if no version has been set.  If called with an argument it
	   sets the LDIF version to VERSION.

	   According to RFC 2849 currently the only legal value for VERSION is
	   1.

       handle ( )
	   Returns the file handle the "Net::LDAP::LDIF" object reads from or
	   writes to.

       done ( )
	   This method signals that the LDIF object is no longer needed. If a
	   file was opened automatically when the object was created it will
	   be closed. This method is called automatically via DESTROY when the
	   object goes out of scope.

       error ( )
	   Returns error message if error was found.

       error_lines ( )
	   Returns lines that resulted in error.

       current_entry ( )
	   Returns the current "Net::LDAP::Entry" object.

       current_lines ( )
	   Returns the lines that generated the current "Net::LDAP::Entry"
	   object.

       next_lines ( )
	   Returns the lines that will generate the next "Net::LDAP::Entry"
	   object.
