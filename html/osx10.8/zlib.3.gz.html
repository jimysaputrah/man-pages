NAME
       zlib - compression/decompression library

SYNOPSIS
       [see zlib.h for full description]

DESCRIPTION
       The  zlib  library  is a general purpose data compression library.  The
       code is thread safe, assuming that the standard library functions  used
       are  thread  safe, such as memory allocation routines.  It provides in-
       memory compression and  decompression  functions,  including  integrity
       checks  of the uncompressed data.  This version of the library supports
       only one compression method (deflation) but  other  algorithms  may  be
       added later with the same stream interface.

       Compression  can  be  done  in  a  single step if the buffers are large
       enough or can be done by repeated calls of  the	compression  function.
       In the latter case, the application must provide more input and/or con-
       sume the output (providing more output space) before each call.

       The library also supports reading and writing files  in	gzip(1)  (.gz)
       format with an interface similar to that of stdio.

       The  library  does  not install any signal handler.  The decoder checks
       the consistency of the compressed data, so  the	library  should  never
       crash even in the case of corrupted input.

       All  functions  of  the	compression library are documented in the file
       zlib.h.	The distribution  source  includes  examples  of  use  of  the
       library	in  the files example.c and minigzip.c, as well as other exam-
       ples in the examples/ directory.

       Changes to this version are  documented	in  the  file  ChangeLog  that
       accompanies the source.

       zlib is available in Java using the java.util.zip package:

	      http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/Programming/com-
	      pression/

       A Perl interface to zlib, written by Paul Marquess (pmqs@cpan.org),  is
       available  at  CPAN (Comprehensive Perl Archive Network) sites, includ-
       ing:

	      http://search.cpan.org/~pmqs/IO-Compress-Zlib/

       A Python interface to zlib, written by A.M. Kuchling  (amk@magnet.com),
       is available in Python 1.5 and later versions:

	      http://www.python.org/doc/lib/module-zlib.html

       zlib is built into tcl:

	      http://wiki.tcl.tk/4610

       An experimental package to read and write files in .zip format, written
       on top of zlib by Gilles Vollant (info@winimage.com), is available at:

	      http://www.winimage.com/zLibDll/minizip.html  and  also  in  the
	      contrib/minizip  directory of the main zlib source distribution.

SEE ALSO
       The zlib web site can be found at:

	      http://zlib.net/

       The data format used by the zlib library is described by  RFC  (Request
       for Comments) 1950 to 1952 in the files:

	      http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1950.txt  (for  the  zlib  header and
	      trailer format)
	      http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1951.txt (for the deflate  compressed
	      data format)
	      http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1952.txt  (for  the  gzip  header and
	      trailer format)

       Mark Nelson wrote an article about zlib for the Jan. 1997 issue of  Dr.
       Dobb's Journal; a copy of the article is available at:

REPORTING PROBLEMS
       Before  reporting  a  problem, please check the zlib web site to verify
       that you have the latest version of zlib; otherwise, obtain the	latest
       version	and see if the problem still exists.  Please read the zlib FAQ
       at:

	      http://zlib.net/zlib_faq.html

       before  asking  for  help.    Send   questions	and/or	 comments   to
       zlib@gzip.org,  or  (for  the  Windows  DLL  version) to Gilles Vollant
       (info@winimage.com).
