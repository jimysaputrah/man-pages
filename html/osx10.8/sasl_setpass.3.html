NAME
       sasl_setpass - Check a plaintext password

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sasl/sasl.h>

       int sasl_setpass(sasl_conn_t *conn,
			const char *user,
			const char *pass, unsigned passlen,
			 const char *oldpass, unsigned oldpasslen,
			 unsigned flags)


DESCRIPTION
       sasl_setpass  will set passwords in the sasldb, and trigger the setpass
       callbacks for all available mechanisms.

       user is the username to set the password for.

       pass and passlen are the password to set and its length

       oldpass and oldpasslen are the old  password  &	its  length  (and  are
       optional)

       flags  Are  flags  including  SASL_SET_CREATE  and SASL_SET_DISABLE (to
       cause the creating of nonexistant accounts and  the  disableing	of  an
       account, respectively)


NOTES
       oldpass	and  oldpasslen  are  unused in the Cyrus SASL implementation,
       though are passed on to any mechanisms that may require them.


RETURN VALUE
       Returns SASL_OK on success. SASL error code on failure.
