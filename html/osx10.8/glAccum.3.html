NAME
       glAccum - operate on the accumulation buffer


C SPECIFICATION
       void glAccum( GLenum op,
		     GLfloat value )


PARAMETERS
       op     Specifies the accumulation buffer operation.  Symbolic constants
	      GL_ACCUM, GL_LOAD, GL_ADD, GL_MULT, and GL_RETURN are  accepted.

       value  Specifies a floating-point value used in the accumulation buffer
	      operation.  op determines how value is used.

DESCRIPTION
       The accumulation buffer is an extended-range color buffer.  Images  are
       not  rendered  into  it.  Rather, images rendered into one of the color
       buffers are added to the contents of the accumulation buffer after ren-
       dering.	Effects such as antialiasing (of points, lines, and polygons),
       motion blur, and depth of field can be created by  accumulating	images
       generated with different transformation matrices.

       Each pixel in the accumulation buffer consists of red, green, blue, and
       alpha values.  The number of bits per  component  in  the  accumulation
       buffer  depends	on  the implementation. You can examine this number by
       calling glGetIntegerv four  times,  with  arguments  GL_ACCUM_RED_BITS,
       GL_ACCUM_GREEN_BITS,   GL_ACCUM_BLUE_BITS,   and   GL_ACCUM_ALPHA_BITS.
       Regardless of the number of bits per component,	the  range  of	values
       stored  by  each  component is [-1, 1].	The accumulation buffer pixels
       are mapped one-to-one with frame buffer pixels.

       glAccum operates on the accumulation buffer.  The first	argument,  op,
       is  a  symbolic constant that selects an accumulation buffer operation.
       The second argument, value, is a floating-point value  to  be  used  in
       that  operation.   Five	operations  are  specified: GL_ACCUM, GL_LOAD,
       GL_ADD, GL_MULT, and GL_RETURN.

       All accumulation buffer operations are limited to the area of the  cur-
       rent  scissor  box and applied identically to the red, green, blue, and
       alpha components of each pixel.	If a glAccum operation	results  in  a
       value outside the range [-1, 1], the contents of an accumulation buffer
       pixel component are undefined.

       The operations are as follows:

       GL_ACCUM      Obtains R, G, B, and A values from the  buffer  currently
		     selected  for reading (see glReadBuffer).	Each component
		     value is divided by (2^n)-1, where n  is  the  number  of
		     bits  allocated  to each color component in the currently
		     selected buffer.  The result is a floating-point value in
		     the  range [0, 1], which is multiplied by value and added
		     to the corresponding pixel component in the  accumulation
		     buffer, thereby updating the accumulation buffer.

       GL_LOAD	     Similar to GL_ACCUM, except that the current value in the
		     accumulation buffer is not used in the calculation of the
		     new  value.   That is, the R, G, B, and A values from the
		     currently selected buffer are divided by (2^n)-1,	multi-
		     plied  by	value,	and  then  stored in the corresponding
		     accumulation buffer cell, overwriting the current	value.

       GL_ADD	     Adds  value  to  each  R, G, B, and A in the accumulation
		     buffer.

       GL_MULT	     Multiplies each R, G, B, and A in the accumulation buffer
		     by  value	and returns the scaled component to its corre-
		     sponding accumulation buffer location.

       GL_RETURN     Transfers accumulation buffer values to the color	buffer
		     or buffers currently selected for writing.  Each R, G, B,
		     and A component is multiplied by value,  then  multiplied
		     by  (2^n)-1, clamped to the range [0,(2^n)-1], and stored
		     in the corresponding display buffer cell.	The only frag-
		     ment  operations  that  are  applied to this transfer are
		     pixel   ownership,   scissor,   dithering,   and	 color
		     writemasks.

       To clear the accumulation buffer, call glClearAccum with R, G, B, and A
       values to set it to, then call glClear  with  the  accumulation	buffer
       enabled.

NOTES
       Only  pixels  within  the  current scissor box are updated by a glAccum
       operation.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if op is not an accepted value.

       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if there is no accumulation buffer.

       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if glAccum is	executed  between  the
       execution of glBegin and the corresponding execution of glEnd.
