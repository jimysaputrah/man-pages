DESCRIPTION
       Net::LDAP is a collection of modules that implements a LDAP services
       API for Perl programs. The module may be used to search directories or
       perform maintenance functions such as adding, deleting or modifying
       entries.

       This document assumes that the reader has some knowledge of the LDAP
       protocol.

CONSTRUCTOR
       new ( HOST, OPTIONS )
	   Creates a new Net::LDAP object and opens a connection to the named
	   host.

	   "HOST" may be a host name or an IP number. TCP port may be
	   specified after the host name followed by a colon (such as
	   localhost:10389). The default TCP port for LDAP is 389.

	   You can also specify a URI, such as 'ldaps://127.0.0.1:666' or
	   'ldapi://%2fvar%2flib%2fldap_sock'. Note that '%2f's in the LDAPI
	   socket path will be translated into '/'. This is to support LDAP
	   query options like base, search etc. although the query part of the
	   URI will be ignored in this context. If port was not specified in
	   the URI, the default is either 389 or 636 for 'LDAP' and 'LDAPS'
	   schemes respectively.

	   "HOST" may also be a reference to an array of hosts, host-port
	   pairs or URIs to try. Each will be tried in order until a
	   connection is made. Only when all have failed will the result of
	   "undef" be returned.

	   port =&gt N
	       Port to connect to on the remote server. May be overridden by
	       "HOST".

	   scheme =&gt 'ldap' | 'ldaps' | 'ldapi'
	       Connection scheme to use when not using an URI as "HOST".
	       (Default: ldap)

	   timeout =&gt N
	       Timeout passed to IO::Socket when connecting the remote server.
	       (Default: 120)

	   multihomed =&gt N
	       Will be passed to IO::Socket as the "MultiHomed" parameter when
	       connecting to the remote server

	   localaddr =&gt HOST
	       Will be passed to IO::Socket as the "LocalAddr" parameter,
	       which sets the client's IP address (as opposed to the server's
	       IP address.)

	   debug =&gt N
	       Set the debug level. See the debug method for details.

	   async =&gt 1
	       Perform all operations asynchronously.

	   onerror =&gt 'die' | 'warn' | undef | sub { ... }
	       In synchronous mode, change what happens when an error is
	       detected.

	       'die'
		   Net::LDAP will croak whenever an error is detected.

	       'warn'
		   Net::LDAP will warn whenever an error is detected.

	       undef
		   Net::LDAP will warn whenever an error is detected and "-w"
		   is in effect. The method that was called will return
		   "undef".

	       sub { ... }
		   The given sub will be called in a scalar context with a
		   single argument, the result message. The value returned
		   will be the return value for the method that was called.

	   version =&gt N
	       Set the protocol version being used (default is LDAPv3). This
	       is useful if you want to talk to an old server and therefore
	       have to use LDAPv2.

	   raw =&gt REGEX
	       Use REGEX to denote the names of attributes that are to be
	       considered binary in search results.

	       When running on Perl 5.8 and this option is given Net::LDAP
	       converts all values of attributes not matching this REGEX into
	       Perl UTF-8 strings so that the regular Perl operators (pattern
	       matching, ...) can operate as one expects even on strings with
	       international characters.

	       If this option is not given or the version of Perl Net::LDAP is
	       running on is too old strings are encoded the same as in
	       earlier versions of perl-ldap.

	       Example: raw =&gt qr/(?i:^jpegPhoto|;binary)/

	   inet6 =&gt N
	       Try to connect to the server using IPv6 if "HOST" resolves to
	       an IPv6 target address.	If it resolves to an IPv4 address, the
	       connection is tried using IPv4, the same way as if this option
	       was not given.

	       Please note that IPv6 support is considered experimental in
	       IO::Socket::SSL, which is used of SSL/TLS support, and there
	       are a few issues to take care of. See "IPv6" in IO::Socket::SSL
	       for details.

	   Example

	     $ldap = Net::LDAP-&gtnew( 'remote.host', async =&gt 1 );

	   LDAPS connections have some extra valid options, see the start_tls
	   method for details. Note the default value for 'sslversion' for
	   LDAPS is 'sslv2/3', and the default port for LDAPS is 636.

	   For LDAPI connections, HOST is actually the location of a UNIX
	   domain socket to connect to. The default location is
	   '/var/run/ldapi'.

METHODS
       Each of the following methods take as arguments some number of fixed
       parameters followed by options, these options are passed in a named
       fashion, for example

	 $mesg = $ldap-&gtbind( "cn=me,o=example", password =&gt "mypasswd");

       The return value from these methods is an object derived from the
       Net::LDAP::Message class. The methods of this class allow you to
       examine the status of the request.

       abandon ( ID, OPTIONS )
	   Abandon a previously issued request. "ID" may be a number or an
	   object which is a sub-class of Net::LDAP::Message, returned from a
	   previous method call.

	   control =&gt CONTROL
	   control =&gt [ CONTROL, ... ]
	       See "CONTROLS" below

	   callback =&gt CALLBACK
	       See "CALLBACKS" below

	   Example

	     $res = $ldap-&gtsearch( @search_args );

	     $mesg = $ldap-&gtabandon( $res ); # This could be written as $res-&gtabandon

       add ( DN, OPTIONS )
	   Add a new entry to the directory. "DN" can be either a
	   Net::LDAP::Entry object or a string.

	   attrs =&gt [ ATTR =&gt VALUE, ... ]
	       "VALUE" should be a string if only a single value is wanted, or
	       a reference to an array of strings if multiple values are
	       wanted.

	       This argument is not used if "DN" is a Net::LDAP::Entry object.

	   control =&gt CONTROL
	   control =&gt [ CONTROL, ... ]
	       See "CONTROLS" below

	   callback =&gt CALLBACK
	       See "CALLBACKS" below

	   Example

	     # $entry is an object of class Net::LDAP::Entry
	     $mesg = $ldap-&gtadd( $entry );

	     $mesg = $ldap-&gtadd( $dn,
				 attrs =&gt [
				   name  =&gt 'Graham Barr',
				   attr  =&gt 'value1',
				   attr  =&gt 'value2',
				   multi =&gt [qw(value1 value2)]
				 ]
			       );

       bind ( DN, OPTIONS )
	   Bind (log in) to the server. "DN" is the DN to bind with. An
	   anonymous bind may be done by calling bind without any arguments.

	   control =&gt CONTROL
	   control =&gt [ CONTROL, ... ]
	       See "CONTROLS" below

	   callback =&gt CALLBACK
	       See "CALLBACKS" below

	   noauth | anonymous =&gt 1
	       Bind without any password. The value passed with this option is
	       ignored.

	   password =&gt PASSWORD
	       Bind with the given password.

	   sasl =&gt SASLOBJ
	       Bind using a SASL mechanism. The argument given should be a
	       sub-class of Authen::SASL or an Authen::SASL client connection
	       by calling "client_new" on an Authen::SASL object.

	       If passed an Authen::SASL object then "client_new" will be
	       called to create a client connection object. The hostname
	       passed by "Net::LDAP" to "client_new" is the result of calling
	       "peerhost" on the socket. If this is not correct for your
	       environment, consider calling "client_new" and passing the
	       client connection object.

	   Example

	     $mesg = $ldap-&gtbind; # Anonymous bind

	     $mesg = $ldap-&gtbind( $dn, password =&gt $password );

	     # $sasl is an object of class Authen::SASL
	     $mesg = $ldap-&gtbind( $dn, sasl =&gt $sasl, version =&gt 3 );

       compare ( DN, OPTIONS )
	   Compare values in an attribute in the entry given by "DN" on the
	   server. "DN" may be a string or a Net::LDAP::Entry object.

	   attr =&gt ATTR
	       The name of the attribute to compare.

	   value =&gt VALUE
	       The value to compare with.

	   control =&gt CONTROL
	   control =&gt [ CONTROL, ... ]
	       See "CONTROLS" below.

	   callback =&gt CALLBACK
	       See "CALLBACKS" below.

	   Example

	     $mesg = $ldap-&gtcompare( $dn,
				     attr  =&gt 'cn',
				     value =&gt 'Graham Barr'
				   );

       delete ( DN, OPTIONS )
	   Delete the entry given by "DN" from the server. "DN" may be a
	   string or a Net::LDAP::Entry object.

	   control =&gt CONTROL
	   control =&gt [ CONTROL, ... ]
	       See "CONTROLS" below.

	   callback =&gt CALLBACK
	       See "CALLBACKS" below.

	   Example

	    $mesg = $ldap-&gtdelete( $dn );

       moddn ( DN, OPTIONS )
	   Rename the entry given by "DN" on the server. "DN" may be a string
	   or a Net::LDAP::Entry object.

	   newrdn =&gt RDN
	       This value should be a new RDN to assign to "DN".

	   deleteoldrdn =&gt 1
	       This option should be passed if the existing RDN is to be
	       deleted.

	   newsuperior =&gt NEWDN
	       If given this value should be the DN of the new superior for
	       "DN".

	   control =&gt CONTROL
	   control =&gt [ CONTROL, ... ]
	       See "CONTROLS" below.

	   callback =&gt CALLBACK
	       See "CALLBACKS" below.

	   Example

	    $mesg = $ldap-&gtmoddn( $dn, newrdn =&gt 'cn=Graham Barr' );

       modify ( DN, OPTIONS )
	   Modify the contents of the entry given by "DN" on the server. "DN"
	   may be a string or a Net::LDAP::Entry object.

	   add =&gt { ATTR =&gt VALUE, ... }
	       Add more attributes or values to the entry. "VALUE" should be a
	       string if only a single value is wanted in the attribute, or a
	       reference to an array of strings if multiple values are wanted.

		 $mesg = $ldap-&gtmodify( $dn,
		   add =&gt {
		     description =&gt 'List of members',	  # Add description attribute
		     member	 =&gt [
		       'cn=member1,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com',    # Add to attribute
		       'cn=member2,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com',
		     ]
		   }
		 );

	   delete =&gt [ ATTR, ... ]
	       Delete complete attributes from the entry.

		 $mesg = $ldap-&gtmodify( $dn,
		   delete =&gt ['member','description'] # Delete attributes
		 );

	   delete =&gt { ATTR =&gt VALUE, ... }
	       Delete individual values from an attribute. "VALUE" should be a
	       string if only a single value is being deleted from the
	       attribute, or a reference to an array of strings if multiple
	       values are being deleted.

	       If "VALUE" is a reference to an empty array or all existing
	       values of the attribute are being deleted, then the attribute
	       will be deleted from the entry.

		 $mesg = $ldap-&gtmodify( $dn,
		   delete =&gt {
		     description =&gt 'List of members',
		     member	 =&gt [
		       'cn=member1,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com',    # Remove members
		       'cn=member2,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com',
		     ],
		     seeAlso =&gt [],   # Remove attribute
		   }
		 );

	   replace =&gt { ATTR =&gt VALUE, ... }
	       Replace any existing values in each given attribute with
	       "VALUE". "VALUE" should be a string if only a single value is
	       wanted in the attribute, or a reference to an array of strings
	       if multiple values are wanted. A reference to an empty array
	       will remove the entire attribute. If the attribute does not
	       already exist in the entry, it will be created.

		 $mesg = $ldap-&gtmodify( $dn,
		   replace =&gt {
		     description =&gt 'New List of members', # Change the description
		     member	 =&gt [ # Replace whole list with these
		       'cn=member1,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com',
		       'cn=member2,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com',
		     ],
		     seeAlso =&gt [],   # Remove attribute
		   }
		 );

	   increment =&gt { ATTR =&gt VALUE, ... }
	       Atomically increment the existing value in each given attribute
	       by the provided "VALUE". The attributes need to have integer
	       syntax, or be otherwise "incrementable". Note this will only
	       work if the server advertizes support for
	       LDAP_FEATURE_MODIFY_INCREMENT. Use "supported_feature" in
	       Net::LDAP::RootDSE to check this.

		 $mesg = $ldap-&gtmodify( $dn,
		   increment =&gt {
		     uidNumber =&gt 1 # increment uidNumber by 1
		   }
		 );

	   changes =&gt [ OP =&gt [ ATTR =&gt VALUE ], ... ]
	       This is an alternative to add, delete, replace and increment
	       where the whole operation can be given in a single argument.
	       "OP" should be add, delete, replace or increment. "VALUE"
	       should be either a string or a reference to an array of
	       strings, as before.

	       Use this form if you want to control the order in which the
	       operations will be performed.

		 $mesg = $ldap-&gtmodify( $dn,
		   changes =&gt [
		     add =&gt [
		       description =&gt 'A description',
		       member	   =&gt $newMember,
		     ],
		     delete =&gt [
		       seeAlso =&gt [],
		     ],
		     add =&gt [
		       anotherAttribute =&gt $value,
		     ],
		   ]
		 );

	   control =&gt CONTROL
	   control =&gt [ CONTROL, ... ]
	       See "CONTROLS" below.

	   callback =&gt CALLBACK
	       See "CALLBACKS" below.

	   Example

	    $mesg = $ldap-&gtmodify( $dn, add =&gt { sn =&gt 'Barr' } );

	    $mesg = $ldap-&gtmodify( $dn, delete =&gt [qw(faxNumber)] );

	    $mesg = $ldap-&gtmodify( $dn, delete =&gt { 'telephoneNumber' =&gt '911' } );

	    $mesg = $ldap-&gtmodify( $dn, replace =&gt { 'mail' =&gt 'gbarr@pobox.com' } );

	    $mesg = $ldap-&gtmodify( $dn,
				   changes =&gt [
				       # add sn=Barr
				     add     =&gt [ sn =&gt 'Barr' ],
				       # delete all fax numbers
				     delete  =&gt [ faxNumber =&gt []],
				       # delete phone number 911
				     delete  =&gt [ telephoneNumber =&gt ['911']],
				       # change email address
				     replace =&gt [ mail =&gt 'gbarr@pobox.com']
				   ]
				 );

       search ( OPTIONS )
	   Search the directory using a given filter.  This can be used to
	   read attributes from a single entry, from entries immediately below
	   a particular entry, or a whole subtree of entries.

	   The result is an object of class Net::LDAP::Search.

	   base =&gt DN
	       The DN that is the base object entry relative to which the
	       search is to be performed.

	   scope =&gt 'base' | 'one' | 'sub'
	       By default the search is performed on the whole tree below the
	       specified base object. This maybe changed by specifying a
	       "scope" parameter with one of the following values:

	       base
		   Search only the base object.

	       one Search the entries immediately below the base object.

	       sub Search the whole tree below (and including) the base
		   object. This is the default.

	   deref =&gt 'never' | 'search' | 'find' | 'always'
	       By default aliases are dereferenced to locate the base object
	       for the search, but not when searching subordinates of the base
	       object. This may be changed by specifying a "deref" parameter
	       with one of the following values:

	       never
		   Do not dereference aliases in searching or in locating the
		   base object of the search.

	       search
		   Dereference aliases in subordinates of the base object in
		   searching, but not in locating the base object of the
		   search.

	       find
		   Dereference aliases in locating the base object of the
		   search, but not when searching subordinates of the base
		   object. This is the default.

	       always
		   Dereference aliases both in searching and in locating the
		   base object of the search.

	   sizelimit =&gt N
	       A sizelimit that restricts the maximum number of entries to be
	       returned as a result of the search. A value of 0, and the
	       default, means that no restriction is requested.  Servers may
	       enforce a maximum number of entries to return.

	   timelimit =&gt N
	       A timelimit that restricts the maximum time (in seconds)
	       allowed for a search. A value of 0 (the default), means that no
	       timelimit will be requested.

	   typesonly =&gt 1
	       Only attribute types (no values) should be returned. Normally
	       attribute types and values are returned.

	   filter =&gt FILTER
	       A filter that defines the conditions an entry in the directory
	       must meet in order for it to be returned by the search. This
	       may be a string or a Net::LDAP::Filter object. Values inside
	       filters may need to be escaped to avoid security problems; see
	       Net::LDAP::Filter for a definition of the filter format,
	       including the escaping rules.

	   attrs =&gt [ ATTR, ... ]
	       A list of attributes to be returned for each entry that matches
	       the search filter.

	       If not specified, then the server will return the attributes
	       that are specified as accessible by default given your bind
	       credentials.

	       Certain additional attributes such as "createTimestamp" and
	       other operational attributes may also be available for the
	       asking:

		 $mesg = $ldap-&gtsearch( ... ,
					attrs =&gt ['createTimestamp']
				      );

	       To retrieve the default attributes and additional ones, use
	       '*'.

		 $mesg = $ldap-&gtsearch( ... ,
					attrs =&gt ['*', 'createTimestamp']
				      );

	       To retrieve no attributes (the server only returns the DNs of
	       matching entries), use '1.1':

		 $mesg = $ldap-&gtsearch( ... ,
					attrs =&gt ['1.1']
				      );

	   control =&gt CONTROL
	   control =&gt [ CONTROL, ... ]
	       See "CONTROLS" below.

	   callback =&gt CALLBACK
	       See "CALLBACKS" below.

	   raw =&gt REGEX
	       Use REGEX to denote the names of attributes that are to be
	       considered binary in search results.

	       When running on Perl 5.8 and this option is given Net::LDAP
	       converts all values of attributes not matching this REGEX into
	       Perl UTF-8 strings so that the regular Perl operators (pattern
	       matching, ...) can operate as one expects even on strings with
	       international characters.

	       If this option is not given or the version of Perl Net::LDAP is
	       running on is too old strings are encodeed the same as in
	       earlier versions of perl-ldap.

	       The value provided here overwrites the value inherited from the
	       constructor.

	       Example: raw =&gt qr/(?i:^jpegPhoto|;binary)/

	   Example

	    $mesg = $ldap-&gtsearch(
				   base   =&gt $base_dn,
				   scope  =&gt 'sub',
				   filter =&gt '(|(objectclass=rfc822mailgroup)(sn=jones))'
				 );

	    Net::LDAP::LDIF-&gtnew( \*STDOUT,"w" )-&gtwrite( $mesg-&gtentries );

       start_tls ( OPTIONS )
	   Calling this method will convert the existing connection to using
	   Transport Layer Security (TLS), which provides an encrypted
	   connection. This is only possible if the connection uses LDAPv3,
	   and requires that the server advertizes support for
	   LDAP_EXTENSION_START_TLS. Use "supported_extension" in
	   Net::LDAP::RootDSE to check this.

	   verify =&gt 'none' | 'optional' | 'require'
	       How to verify the server's certificate:

	       none
		   The server may provide a certificate but it will not be
		   checked - this may mean you are be connected to the wrong
		   server

	       optional
		   Verify only when the server offers a certificate

	       require
		   The server must provide a certificate, and it must be
		   valid.

	       If you set verify to optional or require, you must also set
	       either cafile or capath. The most secure option is require.

	   sslversion =&gt 'sslv2' | 'sslv3' | 'sslv2/3' | 'tlsv1'
	       This defines the version of the SSL/TLS protocol to use.
	       Defaults to 'tlsv1'.

	   ciphers =&gt CIPHERS
	       Specify which subset of cipher suites are permissible for this
	       connection, using the standard OpenSSL string format. The
	       default value is 'ALL', which permits all ciphers, even those
	       that don't encrypt.

	   clientcert =&gt '/path/to/cert.pem'
	   clientkey =&gt '/path/to/key.pem'
	   keydecrypt =&gt sub { ... }
	       If you want to use the client to offer a certificate to the
	       server for SSL authentication (which is not the same as for the
	       LDAP Bind operation) then set clientcert to the user's
	       certificate file, and clientkey to the user's private key file.
	       These files must be in PEM format.

	       If the private key is encrypted (highly recommended) then
	       keydecrypt should be a subroutine that returns the decrypting
	       key. For example:

		$ldap = Net::LDAP-&gtnew( 'myhost.example.com', version =&gt 3 );
		$mesg = $ldap-&gtstart_tls(
					  verify =&gt 'require',
					  clientcert =&gt 'mycert.pem',
					  clientkey =&gt 'mykey.pem',
					  keydecrypt =&gt sub { 'secret'; },
					  capath =&gt '/usr/local/cacerts/'
					);

	   capath =&gt '/path/to/servercerts/'
	   cafile =&gt '/path/to/servercert.pem'
	       When verifying the server's certificate, either set capath to
	       the pathname of the directory containing CA certificates, or
	       set cafile to the filename containing the certificate of the CA
	       who signed the server's certificate. These certificates must
	       all be in PEM format.

	       The directory in 'capath' must contain certificates named using
	       the hash value of the certificates' subject names. To generate
	       these names, use OpenSSL like this in Unix:

		   ln -s cacert.pem `openssl x509 -hash -noout &lt cacert.pem`.0

	       (assuming that the certificate of the CA is in cacert.pem.)

	   checkcrl =&gt 1
	       If capath has been configured, then it will also be searched
	       for certificate revocation lists (CRLs) when verifying the
	       server's certificate.  The CRLs' names must follow the form
	       hash.rnum where hash is the hash over the issuer's DN and num
	       is a number starting with 0.

	       See "SSL_check_crl" in IO::Socket::SSL for further information.

       unbind ( )
	   The unbind method does not take any parameters and will unbind you
	   from the server. Some servers may allow you to re-bind or perform
	   other operations after unbinding. If you wish to switch to another
	   set of credentials while continuing to use the same connection, re-
	   binding with another DN and password, without unbind-ing, will
	   generally work.

	   Example

	    $mesg = $ldap-&gtunbind;

       The following methods are for convenience, and do not return
       "Net::LDAP::Message" objects.

       async ( VALUE )
	   If "VALUE" is given the async mode will be set. The previous value
	   will be returned. The value is true if LDAP operations are being
	   performed asynchronously.

       certificate ( )
	   Returns an X509_Certificate object containing the server's
	   certificate. See the IO::Socket::SSL documentation for information
	   about this class.

	   For example, to get the subject name (in a peculiar OpenSSL-
	   specific format, different from RFC 1779 and RFC 2253) from the
	   server's certificate, do this:

	       print "Subject DN: " . $ldaps-&gtcertificate-&gtsubject_name . "\n";

       cipher ( )
	   Returns the cipher mode being used by the connection, in the string
	   format used by OpenSSL.

       debug ( VALUE )
	   If "VALUE" is given the debug bit-value will be set. The previous
	   value will be returned. Debug output will be sent to "STDERR". The
	   bits of this value are:

	    1	Show outgoing packets (using asn_hexdump).
	    2	Show incoming packets (using asn_hexdump).
	    4	Show outgoing packets (using asn_dump).
	    8	Show incoming packets (using asn_dump).

	   The default value is 0.

       disconnect ( )
	   Disconnect from the server

       root_dse ( OPTIONS )
	   The root_dse method retrieves cached information from the server's
	   rootDSE.

	   attrs =&gt [ ATTR, ... ]
	       A reference to a list of attributes to be returned.  If not
	       specified, then the following attributes will be requested

		 subschemaSubentry
		 namingContexts
		 altServer
		 supportedExtension
		 supportedFeatures
		 supportedControl
		 supportedSASLMechanisms
		 supportedLDAPVersion

	   The result is an object of class Net::LDAP::RootDSE.

	   Example

	    my $root = $ldap-&gtroot_dse;
	    # get naming Context
	    $root-&gtget_value( 'namingContext', asref =&gt 1 );
	    # get supported LDAP versions
	    $root-&gtsupported_version;

	   As the root DSE may change in certain circumstances - for instance
	   when you change the connection using start_tls - you should always
	   use the root_dse method to return the most up-to-date copy of the
	   root DSE.

       schema ( OPTIONS )
	   Read schema information from the server.

	   The result is an object of class Net::LDAP::Schema.	Read this
	   documentation for further information about methods that can be
	   performed with this object.

	   dn =&gt DN
	       If a DN is supplied, it will become the base object entry from
	       which the search for schema information will be conducted.  If
	       no DN is supplied the base object entry will be determined from
	       the rootDSE entry.

	   Example

	    my $schema = $ldap-&gtschema;
	    # get objectClasses
	    @ocs = $schema-&gtall_objectclasses;
	    # Get the attributes
	    @atts = $schema-&gtall_attributes;

       socket ( )
	   Returns the underlying "IO::Socket" object being used.

       host ( )
	   Returns the host to which the connection was established.  For
	   LDAPI connections the socket path is returned.

       port ( )
	   Returns the the port connected to or "undef" in case of LDAPI
	   connections.

       uri ( )
	   Returns the URI connected to.

	   As the value returned is that element of the constructor's HOST
	   argument with which the connection was established this may or may
	   not be a legal URI.

       scheme ( )
	   Returns the scheme of the connection. One of ldap, ldaps or ldapi.

       sync ( MESG )
	   Wait for a given "MESG" request to be completed by the server. If
	   no "MESG" is given, then wait for all outstanding requests to be
	   completed.

	   Returns an error code defined in Net::LDAP::Constant.

       process ( MESG )
	   Process any messages that the server has sent, but do not block. If
	   "MESG" is specified then return as soon as "MESG" has been
	   processed.

	   Returns an error code defined in Net::LDAP::Constant.

       version ( )
	   Returns the version of the LDAP protocol that is being used.

CONTROLS
       Many of the methods described above accept a control option.  This
       allows the user to pass controls to the server as described in LDAPv3.

       A control is a reference to a HASH and should contain the three
       elements below. If any of the controls are blessed then the method
       "to_asn" will be called which should return a reference to a HASH
       containing the three elements described below.

       For most purposes Net::LDAP::Control objects are the easiest way to
       generate controls.

       type =&gt OID
	   This element must be present and is the name of the type of control
	   being requested.

       critical =&gt FLAG
	   critical is optional and should be a boolean value, if it is not
	   specified then it is assumed to be false.

       value =&gt VALUE
	   If the control being requested requires a value then this element
	   should hold the value for the server.

CALLBACKS
       Most of the above commands accept a callback option. This option should
       be a reference to a subroutine. This subroutine will be called for each
       packet received from the server as a response to the request sent.

       When the subroutine is called the first argument will be the
       Net::LDAP::Message object which was returned from the method.

       If the request is a search then multiple packets can be received from
       the server. Each entry is received as a separate packet. For each of
       these the subroutine will be called with a Net::LDAP::Entry object as
       the second argument.

       During a search the server may also send a list of references. When
       such a list is received then the subroutine will be called with a
       Net::LDAP::Reference object as the second argument.

LDAP ERROR CODES
       Net::LDAP also exports constants for the error codes that can be
       received from the server, see Net::LDAP::Constant.
