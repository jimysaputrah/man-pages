NAME
       img-window - Img, Tk Windows (window)

SYNOPSIS
       package require Tk

       package require img::window  ?1.3?

       image create photo ?name? ?options?

_________________________________________________________________

DESCRIPTION
       The  package img::window is a sub-package of Img. It can be loaded as a
       part of the complete Img support, via package require Img,  or  on  its
       own, via package require img::window.

       Like  all packages of Img it does not provide new commands, but extends
       the existing Tk command image.  More specifically  img::window  extends
       Tk's photo image type.

       The name of the new format handler is window.

       This  handler  does not provide additional configuration options.  This
       handler is special. Instead of reading or writing  image  data  from  a
       file  or  string  it allows the embedding of a Tk widget into the photo
       image. In other words, it takes a snapshot of the contents of a Tk win-
       dow.

       All of the above means that in a call like

       image create photo ?name? ?options?


       [1]    Image data in window format (option -data) is detected automati-
	      cally. Image data is considered to be in the  window  format  if
	      the  value  given  to option -data is the name of an existing Tk
	      window.

	      Note that the standard option -file is  not  supported  by  this
	      handler.

       [2]    The format name window is recognized by the option -format.
