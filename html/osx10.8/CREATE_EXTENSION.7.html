CREATE EXTENSION(7)	PostgreSQL 9.1.4 Documentation	   CREATE EXTENSION(7)



NAME
       CREATE_EXTENSION - install an extension

SYNOPSIS
       CREATE EXTENSION [ IF NOT EXISTS ] extension_name
	   [ WITH ] [ SCHEMA schema ]
		    [ VERSION version ]
		    [ FROM old_version ]

DESCRIPTION
       CREATE EXTENSION loads a new extension into the current database. There
       must not be an extension of the same name already loaded.

       Loading an extension essentially amounts to running the extension's
       script file. The script will typically create new SQL objects such as
       functions, data types, operators and index support methods.  CREATE
       EXTENSION additionally records the identities of all the created
       objects, so that they can be dropped again if DROP EXTENSION is issued.

       Loading an extension requires the same privileges that would be
       required to create its component objects. For most extensions this
       means superuser or database owner privileges are needed. The user who
       runs CREATE EXTENSION becomes the owner of the extension for purposes
       of later privilege checks, as well as the owner of any objects created
       by the extension's script.

PARAMETERS
       IF NOT EXISTS
	   Do not throw an error if an extension with the same name already
	   exists. A notice is issued in this case. Note that there is no
	   guarantee that the existing extension is anything like the one that
	   would have been created from the currently-available script file.

       extension_name
	   The name of the extension to be installed.  PostgreSQL will create
	   the extension using details from the file
	   SHAREDIR/extension/extension_name.control.

       schema
	   The name of the schema in which to install the extension's objects,
	   given that the extension allows its contents to be relocated. The
	   named schema must already exist. If not specified, and the
	   extension's control file does not specify a schema either, the
	   current default object creation schema is used.

       version
	   The version of the extension to install. This can be written as
	   either an identifier or a string literal. The default version is
	   whatever is specified in the extension's control file.

       old_version
	   FROM old_version must be specified when, and only when, you are
	   attempting to install an extension that replaces an "old style"
	   module that is just a collection of objects not packaged into an
	   extension. This option causes CREATE EXTENSION to run an
	   alternative installation script that absorbs the existing objects
	   into the extension, instead of creating new objects. Be careful
	   that SCHEMA specifies the schema containing these pre-existing
	   objects.

	   The value to use for old_version is determined by the extension's
	   author, and might vary if there is more than one version of the
	   old-style module that can be upgraded into an extension. For the
	   standard additional modules supplied with pre-9.1 PostgreSQL, use
	   unpackaged for old_version when updating a module to extension
	   style.

NOTES
       Before you can use CREATE EXTENSION to load an extension into a
       database, the extension's supporting files must be installed.
       Information about installing the extensions supplied with PostgreSQL
       can be found in Additional Supplied Modules.

       The extensions currently available for loading can be identified from
       the pg_available_extensions or pg_available_extension_versions system
       views.

       For information about writing new extensions, see Section 35.15,
       "Packaging Related Objects into an Extension", in the documentation.

EXAMPLES
       Install the hstore extension into the current database:

	   CREATE EXTENSION hstore;

       Update a pre-9.1 installation of hstore into extension style:

	   CREATE EXTENSION hstore SCHEMA public FROM unpackaged;

       Be careful to specify the schema in which you installed the existing
       hstore objects.

COMPATIBILITY
       CREATE EXTENSION is a PostgreSQL extension.
