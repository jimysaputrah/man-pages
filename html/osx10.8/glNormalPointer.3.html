NAME
       glNormalPointer - define an array of normals


C SPECIFICATION
       void glNormalPointer( GLenum type,
			     GLsizei stride,
			     const GLvoid *pointer )


PARAMETERS
       type	Specifies the data type of each coordinate in the array.  Sym-
		bolic  constants  GL_BYTE,  GL_SHORT,  GL_INT,	GL_FLOAT,  and
		GL_DOUBLE are accepted. The initial value is GL_FLOAT.

       stride	Specifies  the	byte  offset  between  consecutive normals. If
		stride is 0- the initial value-the normals are	understood  to
		be tightly packed in the array.  The initial value is 0.

       pointer	Specifies  a pointer to the first coordinate of the first nor-
		mal in the array.  The initial value is 0.

DESCRIPTION
       glNormalPointer specifies the location and data	of an array of normals
       to  use	when  rendering.   type  specifies the data type of the normal
       coordinates and stride gives the byte stride from  one  normal  to  the
       next, allowing vertices and attributes to be packed into a single array
       or stored in separate arrays.  (Single-array storage may be more  effi-
       cient on some implementations; see glInterleavedArrays.)  When a normal
       array is specified, type, stride, and pointer are saved as  client-side
       state.

       To  enable  and	disable the normal array, call glEnableClientState and
       glDisableClientState with the argument GL_NORMAL_ARRAY. If enabled, the
       normal	array	is   used   when   glDrawArrays,   glDrawElements,  or
       glArrayElement is called.

       Use glDrawArrays to construct a sequence of primitives (all of the same
       type)  from  prespecified  vertex  and  vertex  attribute  arrays.  Use
       glArrayElement to specify primitives by indexing  vertices  and	vertex
       attributes  and glDrawElements to construct a sequence of primitives by
       indexing vertices and vertex attributes.

NOTES
       glNormalPointer is available only if the GL version is 1.1 or  greater.

       The  normal  array  is  initially  disabled  and  isn't	accessed  when
       glArrayElement, glDrawElements, or glDrawArrays is called.

       Execution of glNormalPointer is not allowed  between  glBegin  and  the
       corresponding  glEnd,  but  an error may or may not be generated. If an
       error is not generated, the operation is undefined.

       glNormalPointer is typically implemented on the client side.

       Since the normal array parameters are client-side state, they  are  not
       saved	or    restored	 by   glPushAttrib   and   glPopAttrib.    Use
       glPushClientAttrib and glPopClientAttrib instead.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if type is not an accepted value.

       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if stride is negative.

       glIsEnabled with argument GL_NORMAL_ARRAY
       glGet with argument GL_NORMAL_ARRAY_TYPE
       glGet with argument GL_NORMAL_ARRAY_STRIDE
