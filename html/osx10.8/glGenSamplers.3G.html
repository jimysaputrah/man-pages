NAME
       glGenSamplers - generate sampler object names

C SPECIFICATION
       void glGenSamplers(GLsizei n, GLuint *samplers);

PARAMETERS
       n
	   Specifies the number of sampler object names to generate.

       samplers
	   Specifies an array in which the generated sampler object names are
	   stored.

DESCRIPTION
       glGenSamplers returns n sampler object names in samplers. There is no
       guarantee that the names form a contiguous set of integers; however, it
       is guaranteed that none of the returned names was in use immediately
       before the call to glGenSamplers.

       Sampler object names returned by a call to glGenSamplers are not
       returned by subsequent calls, unless they are first deleted with
       glDeleteSamplers().

       The names returned in samplers are marked as used, for the purposes of
       glGenSamplers only, but they acquire state and type only when they are
       first bound.

NOTES
       glGenSamplers is available only if the GL version is 3.3 or higher.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if n is negative.
