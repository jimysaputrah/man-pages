NAME
       DBIx::Class::ResultClass::HashRefInflator - Get raw hashrefs from a
       resultset

SYNOPSIS
	use DBIx::Class::ResultClass::HashRefInflator;

	my $rs = $schema->resultset('CD');
	$rs->result_class('DBIx::Class::ResultClass::HashRefInflator');
	while (my $hashref = $rs->next) {
	  ...
	}

	 OR as an attribute:

	my $rs = $schema->resultset('CD')->search({}, {
	  result_class => 'DBIx::Class::ResultClass::HashRefInflator',
	});
	while (my $hashref = $rs->next) {
	  ...
	}

DESCRIPTION
       DBIx::Class is faster than older ORMs like Class::DBI but it still
       isn't designed primarily for speed. Sometimes you need to quickly
       retrieve the data from a massive resultset, while skipping the creation
       of fancy row objects.  Specifying this class as a "result_class" for a
       resultset will change "$rs->next" to return a plain data hash-ref (or a
       list of such hash-refs if "$rs->all" is used).

       There are two ways of applying this class to a resultset:

       o   Specify "$rs->result_class" on a specific resultset to affect only
	   that resultset (and any chained off of it); or

       o   Specify "__PACKAGE__->result_class" on your source object to force
	   all uses of that result source to be inflated to hash-refs - this
	   approach is not recommended.

METHODS
   inflate_result
       Inflates the result and prefetched data into a hash-ref (invoked by
       DBIx::Class::ResultSet)

CAVEATS
       o   This will not work for relationships that have been prefetched.
	   Consider the following:

	    my $artist = $artitsts_rs->search({}, {prefetch => 'cds' })->first;

	    my $cds = $artist->cds;
	    $cds->result_class('DBIx::Class::ResultClass::HashRefInflator');
	    my $first = $cds->first;

	   $first will not be a hashref, it will be a normal CD row since
	   HashRefInflator only affects resultsets at inflation time, and
	   prefetch causes relations to be inflated when the master $artist
	   row is inflated.

       o   Column value inflation, e.g., using modules like
	   DBIx::Class::InflateColumn::DateTime, is not performed.  The
	   returned hash contains the raw database values.
