NAME
       ALTER_OPERATOR_CLASS - change the definition of an operator class

SYNOPSIS
       ALTER OPERATOR CLASS name USING index_method RENAME TO new_name
       ALTER OPERATOR CLASS name USING index_method OWNER TO new_owner
       ALTER OPERATOR CLASS name USING index_method SET SCHEMA new_schema

DESCRIPTION
       ALTER OPERATOR CLASS changes the definition of an operator class.

       You must own the operator class to use ALTER OPERATOR CLASS. To alter
       the owner, you must also be a direct or indirect member of the new
       owning role, and that role must have CREATE privilege on the operator
       class's schema. (These restrictions enforce that altering the owner
       doesn't do anything you couldn't do by dropping and recreating the
       operator class. However, a superuser can alter ownership of any
       operator class anyway.)

PARAMETERS
       name
	   The name (optionally schema-qualified) of an existing operator
	   class.

       index_method
	   The name of the index method this operator class is for.

       new_name
	   The new name of the operator class.

       new_owner
	   The new owner of the operator class.

       new_schema
	   The new schema for the operator class.

COMPATIBILITY
       There is no ALTER OPERATOR CLASS statement in the SQL standard.
