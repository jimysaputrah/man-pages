NAME
       Net::Netrc - OO interface to users netrc file

SYNOPSIS
	   use Net::Netrc;

	   $mach = Net::Netrc->lookup('some.machine');
	   $login = $mach->login;
	   ($login, $password, $account) = $mach->lpa;

DESCRIPTION
       "Net::Netrc" is a class implementing a simple interface to the .netrc
       file used as by the ftp program.

       "Net::Netrc" also implements security checks just like the ftp program,
       these checks are, first that the .netrc file must be owned by the user
       and second the ownership permissions should be such that only the owner
       has read and write access. If these conditions are not met then a
       warning is output and the .netrc file is not read.

THE .netrc FILE
       The .netrc file contains login and initialization information used by
       the auto-login process.	It resides in the user's home directory.  The
       following tokens are recognized; they may be separated by spaces, tabs,
       or new-lines:

       machine name
	   Identify a remote machine name. The auto-login process searches the
	   .netrc file for a machine token that matches the remote machine
	   specified.  Once a match is made, the subsequent .netrc tokens are
	   processed, stopping when the end of file is reached or an- other
	   machine or a default token is encountered.

       default
	   This is the same as machine name except that default matches any
	   name.  There can be only one default token, and it must be after
	   all machine tokens.	This is normally used as:

	       default login anonymous password user@site

	   thereby giving the user automatic anonymous login to machines not
	   specified in .netrc.

       login name
	   Identify a user on the remote machine.  If this token is present,
	   the auto-login process will initiate a login using the specified
	   name.

       password string
	   Supply a password.  If this token is present, the auto-login
	   process will supply the specified string if the remote server
	   requires a password as part of the login process.

       account string
	   Supply an additional account password.  If this token is present,
	   the auto-login process will supply the specified string if the
	   remote server requires an additional account password.

       macdef name
	   Define a macro. "Net::Netrc" only parses this field to be
	   compatible with ftp.

CONSTRUCTOR
       The constructor for a "Net::Netrc" object is not called new as it does
       not really create a new object. But instead is called "lookup" as this
       is essentially what it does.

       lookup ( MACHINE [, LOGIN ])
	   Lookup and return a reference to the entry for "MACHINE". If
	   "LOGIN" is given then the entry returned will have the given login.
	   If "LOGIN" is not given then the first entry in the .netrc file for
	   "MACHINE" will be returned.

	   If a matching entry cannot be found, and a default entry exists,
	   then a reference to the default entry is returned.

	   If there is no matching entry found and there is no default
	   defined, or no .netrc file is found, then "undef" is returned.

METHODS
       login ()
	   Return the login id for the netrc entry

       password ()
	   Return the password for the netrc entry

       account ()
	   Return the account information for the netrc entry

       lpa ()
	   Return a list of login, password and account information fir the
	   netrc entry
