NAME
       PAR::StrippedPARL::Base - Base class for the PARL data packages

SYNOPSIS
	 # Please use one of the siblings of this class instead.
	 use base 'PAR::StrippedPARL::Base';

DESCRIPTION
       This class is internal to PAR. Do not use it outside of PAR.

       This class is basically just a container for a static binary PAR loader
       which doesn't include the PAR code like the parl or parl.exe you are
       used to. If you're really curious, I'll tell you it is just a copy of
       the myldr/static (or myldr/static.exe) file.

       The data is appended during the "make" phase of the PAR build process.

       If the binary data isn't appended during the build process, the two
       class methods will return the empty list.

CLASS METHODS
   write_parl
       Takes a file name as argument. Writes the raw binary data in the
       package to the specified file and embeds the core modules to produce a
       complete PAR loader (parl).

       Returns true on success or the empty list on failure.

   get_raw
       Returns the binary data attached to the data package.

       Returns the empty list on failure.

   write_raw
       Takes a file name as argument and writes the binary data to the file.

       Returns true on success and the empty list on failure.

SUBCLASSING
       Subclasses need to implement the "_data_pos" class method which returns
       the value of "tell DATA" as it was after the class was loaded.
