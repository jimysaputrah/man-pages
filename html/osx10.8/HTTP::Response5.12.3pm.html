NAME
       HTTP::Response - HTTP style response message

SYNOPSIS
       Response objects are returned by the request() method of the
       "LWP::UserAgent":

	   # ...
	   $response = $ua-&gtrequest($request)
	   if ($response-&gtis_success) {
	       print $response-&gtdecoded_content;
	   }
	   else {
	       print STDERR $response-&gtstatus_line, "\n";
	   }

DESCRIPTION
       The "HTTP::Response" class encapsulates HTTP style responses.  A
       response consists of a response line, some headers, and a content body.
       Note that the LWP library uses HTTP style responses even for non-HTTP
       protocol schemes.  Instances of this class are usually created and
       returned by the request() method of an "LWP::UserAgent" object.

       "HTTP::Response" is a subclass of "HTTP::Message" and therefore
       inherits its methods.  The following additional methods are available:

       $r = HTTP::Response-&gtnew( $code )
       $r = HTTP::Response-&gtnew( $code, $msg )
       $r = HTTP::Response-&gtnew( $code, $msg, $header )
       $r = HTTP::Response-&gtnew( $code, $msg, $header, $content )
	   Constructs a new "HTTP::Response" object describing a response with
	   response code $code and optional message $msg.  The optional
	   $header argument should be a reference to an "HTTP::Headers" object
	   or a plain array reference of key/value pairs.  The optional
	   $content argument should be a string of bytes.  The meaning these
	   arguments are described below.

       $r = HTTP::Response-&gtparse( $str )
	   This constructs a new response object by parsing the given string.

       $r-&gtcode
       $r-&gtcode( $code )
	   This is used to get/set the code attribute.	The code is a 3 digit
	   number that encode the overall outcome of a HTTP response.  The
	   "HTTP::Status" module provide constants that provide mnemonic names
	   for the code attribute.

       $r-&gtmessage
       $r-&gtmessage( $message )
	   This is used to get/set the message attribute.  The message is a
	   short human readable single line string that explains the response
	   code.

       $r-&gtheader( $field )
       $r-&gtheader( $field =&gt $value )
	   This is used to get/set header values and it is inherited from
	   "HTTP::Headers" via "HTTP::Message".  See HTTP::Headers for details
	   and other similar methods that can be used to access the headers.

       $r-&gtcontent
       $r-&gtcontent( $bytes )
	   This is used to get/set the raw content and it is inherited from
	   the "HTTP::Message" base class.  See HTTP::Message for details and
	   other methods that can be used to access the content.

       $r-&gtdecoded_content( %options )
	   This will return the content after any "Content-Encoding" and
	   charsets have been decoded.	See HTTP::Message for details.

       $r-&gtrequest
       $r-&gtrequest( $request )
	   This is used to get/set the request attribute.  The request
	   attribute is a reference to the the request that caused this
	   response.  It does not have to be the same request passed to the
	   $ua-&gtrequest() method, because there might have been redirects and
	   authorization retries in between.

       $r-&gtprevious
       $r-&gtprevious( $response )
	   This is used to get/set the previous attribute.  The previous
	   attribute is used to link together chains of responses.  You get
	   chains of responses if the first response is redirect or
	   unauthorized.  The value is "undef" if this is the first response
	   in a chain.

	   Note that the method $r-&gtredirects is provided as a more convenient
	   way to access the response chain.

       $r-&gtstatus_line
	   Returns the string "&ltcode&gt &ltmessage&gt".  If the message attribute is
	   not set then the official name of &ltcode&gt (see HTTP::Status) is
	   substituted.

       $r-&gtbase
	   Returns the base URI for this response.  The return value will be a
	   reference to a URI object.

	   The base URI is obtained from one the following sources (in
	   priority order):

	   1.  Embedded in the document content, for instance &ltBASE
	       HREF="..."&gt in HTML documents.

	   2.  A "Content-Base:" or a "Content-Location:" header in the
	       response.

	       For backwards compatibility with older HTTP implementations we
	       will also look for the "Base:" header.

	   3.  The URI used to request this response. This might not be the
	       original URI that was passed to $ua-&gtrequest() method, because
	       we might have received some redirect responses first.

	   If none of these sources provide an absolute URI, undef is
	   returned.

	   When the LWP protocol modules produce the HTTP::Response object,
	   then any base URI embedded in the document (step 1) will already
	   have initialized the "Content-Base:" header. This means that this
	   method only performs the last 2 steps (the content is not always
	   available either).

       $r-&gtfilename
	   Returns a filename for this response.  Note that doing sanity
	   checks on the returned filename (eg. removing characters that
	   cannot be used on the target filesystem where the filename would be
	   used, and laundering it for security purposes) are the caller's
	   responsibility; the only related thing done by this method is that
	   it makes a simple attempt to return a plain filename with no
	   preceding path segments.

	   The filename is obtained from one the following sources (in
	   priority order):

	   1.  A "Content-Disposition:" header in the response.  Proper
	       decoding of RFC 2047 encoded filenames requires the
	       "MIME::QuotedPrint" (for "Q" encoding), "MIME::Base64" (for "B"
	       encoding), and "Encode" modules.

	   2.  A "Content-Location:" header in the response.

	   3.  The URI used to request this response. This might not be the
	       original URI that was passed to $ua-&gtrequest() method, because
	       we might have received some redirect responses first.

	   If a filename cannot be derived from any of these sources, undef is
	   returned.

       $r-&gtas_string
       $r-&gtas_string( $eol )
	   Returns a textual representation of the response.

       $r-&gtis_info
       $r-&gtis_success
       $r-&gtis_redirect
       $r-&gtis_error
	   These methods indicate if the response was informational,
	   successful, a redirection, or an error.  See HTTP::Status for the
	   meaning of these.

       $r-&gterror_as_HTML
	   Returns a string containing a complete HTML document indicating
	   what error occurred.  This method should only be called when
	   $r-&gtis_error is TRUE.

       $r-&gtredirects
	   Returns the list of redirect responses that lead up to this
	   response by following the $r-&gtprevious chain.  The list order is
	   oldest first.

	   In scalar context return the number of redirect responses leading
	   up to this one.

       $r-&gtcurrent_age
	   Calculates the "current age" of the response as specified by RFC
	   2616 section 13.2.3.  The age of a response is the time since it
	   was sent by the origin server.  The returned value is a number
	   representing the age in seconds.

       $r-&gtfreshness_lifetime( %opt )
	   Calculates the "freshness lifetime" of the response as specified by
	   RFC 2616 section 13.2.4.  The "freshness lifetime" is the length of
	   time between the generation of a response and its expiration time.
	   The returned value is the number of seconds until expiry.

	   If the response does not contain an "Expires" or a "Cache-Control"
	   header, then this function will apply some simple heuristic based
	   on the "Last-Modified" header to determine a suitable lifetime.
	   The following options might be passed to control the heuristics:

	   heuristic_expiry =&gt $bool
	       If passed as a FALSE value, don't apply heuristics and just
	       return "undef" when "Expires" or "Cache-Control" is lacking.

	   h_lastmod_fraction =&gt $num
	       This number represent the fraction of the difference since the
	       "Last-Modified" timestamp to make the expiry time.  The default
	       is 0.10, the suggested typical setting of 10% in RFC 2616.

	   h_min =&gt $sec
	       This is the lower limit of the heuristic expiry age to use.
	       The default is 60 (1 minute).

	   h_max =&gt $sec
	       This is the upper limit of the heuristic expiry age to use.
	       The default is 86400 (24 hours).

	   h_default =&gt $sec
	       This is the expiry age to use when nothing else applies.  The
	       default is 3600 (1 hour) or "h_min" if greater.

       $r-&gtis_fresh( %opt )
	   Returns TRUE if the response is fresh, based on the values of
	   freshness_lifetime() and current_age().  If the response is no
	   longer fresh, then it has to be re-fetched or re-validated by the
	   origin server.

	   Options might be passed to control expiry heuristics, see the
	   description of freshness_lifetime().

       $r-&gtfresh_until( %opt )
	   Returns the time (seconds since epoch) when this entity is no
	   longer fresh.

	   Options might be passed to control expiry heuristics, see the
	   description of freshness_lifetime().
