NAME
       TAP::Parser::Iterator::Process - Internal TAP::Parser Iterator

VERSION
       Version 3.17

SYNOPSIS
	 # see TAP::Parser::IteratorFactory for preferred usage

	 # to use directly:
	 use TAP::Parser::Iterator::Process;
	 my %args = (
	  command  => ['python', 'setup.py', 'test'],
	  merge    => 1,
	  setup    => sub { ... },
	  teardown => sub { ... },
	 );
	 my $it   = TAP::Parser::Iterator::Process->new(\%args);
	 my $line = $it->next;

DESCRIPTION
       This is a simple iterator wrapper for executing external processes,
       used by TAP::Parser.  Unless you're subclassing, you probably won't
       need to use this module directly.

METHODS
   Class Methods
       "new"

       Create an iterator.  Expects one argument containing a hashref of the
       form:

	  command  => \@command_to_execute
	  merge    => $attempt_merge_stderr_and_stdout?
	  setup    => $callback_to_setup_command
	  teardown => $callback_to_teardown_command

       Tries to uses IPC::Open3 & IO::Select to communicate with the spawned
       process if they are available.  Falls back onto "open()".

   Instance Methods
       "next"

       Iterate through the process output, of course.

       "next_raw"

       Iterate raw input without applying any fixes for quirky input syntax.

       "wait"

       Get the wait status for this iterator's process.

       "exit"

       Get the exit status for this iterator's process.

       "handle_unicode"

       Upgrade the input stream to handle UTF8.

       "get_select_handles"

       Return a list of filehandles that may be used upstream in a select()
       call to signal that this Iterator is ready. Iterators that are not
       handle based should return an empty list.
