NAME
       glDrawRangeElements - render primitives from array data

C SPECIFICATION
       void glDrawRangeElements(GLenum mode, GLuint start, GLuint end,
				GLsizei count, GLenum type,
				const GLvoid * indices);

PARAMETERS
       mode
	   Specifies what kind of primitives to render. Symbolic constants
	   GL_POINTS, GL_LINE_STRIP, GL_LINE_LOOP, GL_LINES,
	   GL_LINE_STRIP_ADJACENCY, GL_LINES_ADJACENCY, GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP,
	   GL_TRIANGLE_FAN, GL_TRIANGLES, GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP_ADJACENCY and
	   GL_TRIANGLES_ADJACENCY are accepted.

       start
	   Specifies the minimum array index contained in indices.

       end
	   Specifies the maximum array index contained in indices.

       count
	   Specifies the number of elements to be rendered.

       type
	   Specifies the type of the values in indices. Must be one of
	   GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT, or GL_UNSIGNED_INT.

       indices
	   Specifies a pointer to the location where the indices are stored.

DESCRIPTION
       glDrawRangeElements is a restricted form of glDrawElements().  mode,
       start, end, and count match the corresponding arguments to
       glDrawElements(), with the additional constraint that all values in the
       arrays count must lie between start and end, inclusive.

       Implementations denote recommended maximum amounts of vertex and index
       data, which may be queried by calling glGet() with argument
       GL_MAX_ELEMENTS_VERTICES and GL_MAX_ELEMENTS_INDICES. If end - start +
       1 is greater than the value of GL_MAX_ELEMENTS_VERTICES, or if count is
       greater than the value of GL_MAX_ELEMENTS_INDICES, then the call may
       operate at reduced performance. There is no requirement that all
       vertices in the range start end be referenced. However, the
       implementation may partially process unused vertices, reducing
       performance from what could be achieved with an optimal index set.

       When glDrawRangeElements is called, it uses count sequential elements
       from an enabled array, starting at start to construct a sequence of
       geometric primitives.  mode specifies what kind of primitives are
       constructed, and how the array elements construct these primitives. If
       more than one array is enabled, each is used.

       Vertex attributes that are modified by glDrawRangeElements have an
       unspecified value after glDrawRangeElements returns. Attributes that
       aren't modified maintain their previous values.

NOTES
       GL_LINE_STRIP_ADJACENCY, GL_LINES_ADJACENCY,
       GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP_ADJACENCY and GL_TRIANGLES_ADJACENCY are available
       only if the GL version is 3.2 or greater.

ERRORS
       It is an error for indices to lie outside the range start end, but
       implementations may not check for this situation. Such indices cause
       implementation-dependent behavior.


       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if mode is not an accepted value.


       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if count is negative.


       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if end < start.


       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if a geometry shader is active and
       mode is incompatible with the input primitive type of the geometry
       shader in the currently installed program object.


       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if a non-zero buffer object name is
       bound to an enabled array or the element array and the buffer object's
       data store is currently mapped.
