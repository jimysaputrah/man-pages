NAME
       MooseX::Types::DateTime - DateTime related constraints and coercions
       for Moose

SYNOPSIS
       Export Example:

	       use MooseX::Types::DateTime qw(TimeZone);

	   has time_zone => (
	       isa => TimeZone,
	       is => "rw",
	       coerce => 1,
	   );

	   Class->new( time_zone => "Africa/Timbuktu" );

       Namespaced Example:

	       use MooseX::Types::DateTime;

	   has time_zone => (
	       isa => 'DateTime::TimeZone',

	       coerce => 1,
	   );

	   Class->new( time_zone => "Africa/Timbuktu" );

DESCRIPTION
       This module packages several Moose::Util::TypeConstraints with
       coercions, designed to work with the DateTime suite of objects.

CONSTRAINTS
       DateTime
	   A class type for DateTime.

	   from "Num"
	       Uses "from_epoch" in DateTime. Floating values will be used for
	       subsecond percision, see DateTime for details.

	   from "HashRef"
	       Calls "new" in DateTime with the hash entries as arguments.

       Duration
	   A class type for DateTime::Duration

	   from "Num"
	       Uses "new" in DateTime::Duration and passes the number as the
	       "seconds" argument.

	       Note that due to leap seconds, DST changes etc this may not do
	       what you expect.  For instance passing in 86400 is not always
	       equivalent to one day, although there are that many seconds in
	       a day. See "How Date Math is Done" in DateTime for more
	       details.

	   from "HashRef"
	       Calls "new" in DateTime::Duration with the hash entries as
	       arguments.

       DateTime::Locale
	   A class type for DateTime::Locale::root with the name
	   DateTime::Locale.

	   from "Str"
	       The string is treated as a language tag (e.g. "en" or "he_IL")
	       and given to "load" in DateTime::Locale.

	   from Locale::Maktext
	       The "Locale::Maketext/language_tag" attribute will be used with
	       "load" in DateTime::Locale.

	   DateTime::TimeZone
	       A class type for DateTime::TimeZone.

	       from "Str"
		   Treated as a time zone name or offset. See "USAGE" in
		   DateTime::TimeZone for more details on the allowed values.

		   Delegates to "new" in DateTime::TimeZone with the string as
		   the "name" argument.
