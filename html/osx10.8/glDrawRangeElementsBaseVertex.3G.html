NAME
       glDrawRangeElementsBaseVertex - render primitives from array data with
       a per-element offset

C SPECIFICATION
       void glDrawRangeElementsBaseVertex(GLenum mode, GLuint start,
					  GLuint end, GLsizei count,
					  GLenum type, GLvoid *indices,
					  GLint basevertex);

PARAMETERS
       mode
	   Specifies what kind of primitives to render. Symbolic constants
	   GL_POINTS, GL_LINE_STRIP, GL_LINE_LOOP, GL_LINES,
	   GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP, GL_TRIANGLE_FAN, and GL_TRIANGLES are accepted.

       start
	   Specifies the minimum array index contained in indices.

       end
	   Specifies the maximum array index contained in indices.

       count
	   Specifies the number of elements to be rendered.

       type
	   Specifies the type of the values in indices. Must be one of
	   GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT, or GL_UNSIGNED_INT.

       indices
	   Specifies a pointer to the location where the indices are stored.

       basevertex
	   Specifies a constant that should be added to each element of
	   indices when chosing elements from the enabled vertex arrays.

DESCRIPTION
       glDrawRangeElementsBaseVertex is a restricted form of
       glDrawElementsBaseVertex().  mode, start, end, count and basevertex
       match the corresponding arguments to glDrawElementsBaseVertex(), with
       the additional constraint that all values in the array indices must lie
       between start and end, inclusive, prior to adding basevertex. Index
       values lying outside the range [start, end] are treated in the same way
       as glDrawElementsBaseVertex(). The ith element transferred by the
       corresponding draw call will be taken from element indices[i] +
       basevertex of each enabled array. If the resulting value is larger than
       the maximum value representable by type, it is as if the calculation
       were upconverted to 32-bit unsigned integers (with wrapping on overflow
       conditions). The operation is undefined if the sum would be negative.

NOTES
       glDrawRangeElementsBaseVertex is only supported if the GL version is
       3.2 or greater, or if
		   the ARB_draw_elements_base_vertex extension is supported.
	   .SH "ERRORS"


       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if mode is not an accepted value.


       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if count is negative.


       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if end &lt start.


       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if a geometry shader is active and
       mode is incompatible with the input primitive type of the geometry
       shader in the currently installed program object.


       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if a non-zero buffer object name is
       bound to an enabled array or the element array and the buffer object's
       data store is currently mapped.
