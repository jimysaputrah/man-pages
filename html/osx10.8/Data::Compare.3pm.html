NAME
       Data::Compare - compare perl data structures

SYNOPSIS
	   use Data::Compare;

	   my $h1 = { 'foo' =&gt [ 'bar', 'baz' ],  'FOO' =&gt [ 'one', 'two' ] };
	   my $h2 = { 'foo' =&gt [ 'bar', 'barf' ], 'FOO' =&gt [ 'one', 'two' ] };
	   my @a1 = ('one', 'two');
	   my @a2 = ('bar', 'baz');
	   my %v = ( 'FOO', \@a1, 'foo', \@a2 );

	   # simple procedural interface
	   print 'structures of $h1 and \%v are ',
	     Compare($h1, \%v) ? "" : "not ", "identical.\n";

	   print 'structures of $h1 and $h2 are ',
	     Compare($h1, $h2, { ignore_hash_keys =&gt [qw(foo)] }) ? '' : 'not ',
	     "close enough to identical.\n";

	   # OO usage
	   my $c = new Data::Compare($h1, \%v);
	   print 'structures of $h1 and \%v are ',
	     $c-&gtCmp ? "" : "not ", "identical.\n";
	   # or
	   my $c = new Data::Compare;
	   print 'structures of $h and \%v are ',
	     $c-&gtCmp($h1, \%v) ? "" : "not ", "identical.\n";

DESCRIPTION
       Compare two perl data structures recursively. Returns 0 if the
       structures differ, else returns 1.

       A few data types are treated as special cases:

       Scalar::Properties objects
	   This has been moved into a plugin, although functionality remains
	   the same as with the previous version.  Full documentation is in
	   Data::Compare::Plugins::Scalar::Properties.

       Compiled regular expressions, eg qr/foo/
	   These are stringified before comparison, so the following will
	   match:

	       $r = qr/abc/i;
	       $s = qr/abc/i;
	       Compare($r, $s);

	   and the following won't, despite them matching *exactly* the same
	   text:

	       $r = qr/abc/i;
	       $s = qr/[aA][bB][cC]/;
	       Compare($r, $s);

	   Sorry, that's the best we can do.

       CODE and GLOB references
	   These are assumed not to match unless the references are identical
	   - ie, both are references to the same thing.

       You may also customise how we compare structures by supplying options
       in a hashref as a third parameter to the "Compare()" function.  This is
       not yet available through the OO-ish interface.	These options will be
       in force for the *whole* of your comparison, so will apply to
       structures that are lurking deep down in your data as well as at the
       top level, so beware!

       ignore_hash_keys
	   an arrayref of strings. When comparing two hashes, any keys
	   mentioned in this list will be ignored.

CIRCULAR STRUCTURES
       Comparing a circular structure to itself returns true:

	   $x = \$y;
	   $y = \$x;
	   Compare([$x, $y], [$x, $y]);

       And on a sort-of-related note, if you try to compare insanely deeply
       nested structures, the module will spit a warning.  For this to affect
       you, you need to go around a hundred levels deep though, and if you do
       that you have bigger problems which I can't help you with ;-)

PLUGINS
       The module takes plug-ins so you can provide specialised routines for
       comparing your own objects and data-types.  For details see
       Data::Compare::Plugins.

       Plugins are *not* available when running in "taint" mode.  You may also
       make it not load plugins by providing an empty list as the argument to
       import() - ie, by doing this:

	   use Data::Compare ();

       A couple of functions are provided to examine what goodies have been
       made available through plugins:

       plugins
	   Returns a structure (a hash ref) describing all the comparisons
	   made available through plugins.  This function is *not* exported,
	   so should be called as Data::Compare::plugins().  It takes no
	   parameters.

       plugins_printable
	   Returns formatted text

EXPORTS
       For historical reasons, the Compare() function is exported.  If you
       don't want this, then pass an empty list to import() as explained under
       PLUGINS.  If you want no export but do want plugins, then pass the
       empty list, and then call the register_plugins class method:

	   use Data::Compare ();
	   Data::Compare-&gtregister_plugins;

       or you could call it as a function if that floats your boat.

BUGS
       Plugin support is not quite finished (see the TODO file for details)
       but is usable.  The missing bits are bells and whistles rather than
       core functionality.

       Plugins are unavailable if you can't change to the current directory.
       This might happen if you started your process as a priveleged user and
       then dropped priveleges.  This is due to how we check for Taintedness.
       If this affects you, please supply a portable patch.

       Please report any other bugs either by email to David Cantrell (see
       below for address) or using rt.cpan.org:
