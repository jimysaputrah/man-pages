NAME
       Date::Format - Date formating subroutines

SYNOPSIS
	       use Date::Format;

	       @lt = localtime(time);

	       print time2str($template, time);
	       print strftime($template, @lt);

	       print time2str($template, time, $zone);
	       print strftime($template, @lt, $zone);

	       print ctime(time);
	       print asctime(@lt);

	       print ctime(time, $zone);
	       print asctime(@lt, $zone);

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides routines to format dates into ASCII strings. They
       correspond to the C library routines "strftime" and "ctime".

       time2str(TEMPLATE, TIME [, ZONE])
	   "time2str" converts "TIME" into an ASCII string using the
	   conversion specification given in "TEMPLATE". "ZONE" if given
	   specifies the zone which the output is required to be in, "ZONE"
	   defaults to your current zone.

       strftime(TEMPLATE, TIME [, ZONE])
	   "strftime" is similar to "time2str" with the exception that the
	   time is passed as an array, such as the array returned by
	   "localtime".

       ctime(TIME [, ZONE])
	   "ctime" calls "time2str" with the given arguments using the
	   conversion specification "%a %b %e %T %Y\n"

       asctime(TIME [, ZONE])
	   "asctime" calls "time2str" with the given arguments using the
	   conversion specification "%a %b %e %T %Y\n"

MULTI-LANGUAGE SUPPORT
       Date::Format is capable of formating into several languages by creating
       a language specific object and calling methods, see Date::Language

	       my $lang = Date::Language->new('German');
	       $lang->time2str("%a %b %e %T %Y\n", time);

       I am open to suggestions on this.

CONVERSION SPECIFICATION
       Each conversion specification  is  replaced  by	appropriate characters
       as   described  in  the	following  list.   The appropriate  characters
       are  determined	by   the   LC_TIME category of the program's locale.

	       %%      PERCENT
	       %a      day of the week abbr
	       %A      day of the week
	       %b      month abbr
	       %B      month
	       %c      MM/DD/YY HH:MM:SS
	       %C      ctime format: Sat Nov 19 21:05:57 1994
	       %d      numeric day of the month, with leading zeros (eg 01..31)
	       %e      like %d, but a leading zero is replaced by a space (eg  1..32)
	       %D      MM/DD/YY
	       %G      GPS week number (weeks since January 6, 1980)
	       %h      month abbr
	       %H      hour, 24 hour clock, leading 0's)
	       %I      hour, 12 hour clock, leading 0's)
	       %j      day of the year
	       %k      hour
	       %l      hour, 12 hour clock
	       %L      month number, starting with 1
	       %m      month number, starting with 01
	       %M      minute, leading 0's
	       %n      NEWLINE
	       %o      ornate day of month -- "1st", "2nd", "25th", etc.
	       %p      AM or PM
	       %P      am or pm (Yes %p and %P are backwards :)
	       %q      Quarter number, starting with 1
	       %r      time format: 09:05:57 PM
	       %R      time format: 21:05
	       %s      seconds since the Epoch, UCT
	       %S      seconds, leading 0's
	       %t      TAB
	       %T      time format: 21:05:57
	       %U      week number, Sunday as first day of week
	       %w      day of the week, numerically, Sunday == 0
	       %W      week number, Monday as first day of week
	       %x      date format: 11/19/94
	       %X      time format: 21:05:57
	       %y      year (2 digits)
	       %Y      year (4 digits)
	       %Z      timezone in ascii. eg: PST
	       %z      timezone in format -/+0000

       %d, %e, %H, %I, %j, %k, %l, %m, %M, %q, %y and %Y can be output in
       Roman numerals by prefixing the letter with "O", e.g. %OY will output
       the year as roman numerals.

LIMITATION
       The functions in this module are limited to the time range that can be
       represented by the time_t data type, i.e. 1901-12-13 20:45:53 GMT to
       2038-01-19 03:14:07 GMT.
