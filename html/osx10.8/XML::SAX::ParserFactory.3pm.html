NAME
       XML::SAX::ParserFactory - Obtain a SAX parser

SYNOPSIS
	 use XML::SAX::ParserFactory;
	 use XML::SAX::XYZHandler;
	 my $handler = XML::SAX::XYZHandler->new();
	 my $p = XML::SAX::ParserFactory->parser(Handler => $handler);
	 $p->parse_uri("foo.xml");
	 # or $p->parse_string("<foo/>") or $p->parse_file($fh);

DESCRIPTION
       XML::SAX::ParserFactory is a factory class for providing an application
       with a Perl SAX2 XML parser. It is akin to DBI - a front end for other
       parser classes. Each new SAX2 parser installed will register itself
       with XML::SAX, and then it will become available to all applications
       that use XML::SAX::ParserFactory to obtain a SAX parser.

       Unlike DBI however, XML/SAX parsers almost all work alike (especially
       if they subclass XML::SAX::Base, as they should), so rather than
       specifying the parser you want in the call to "parser()", XML::SAX has
       several ways to automatically choose which parser to use:

       o   $XML::SAX::ParserPackage

	   If this package variable is set, then this package is "require()"d
	   and an instance of this package is returned by calling the "new()"
	   class method in that package. If it cannot be loaded or there is an
	   error, an exception will be thrown. The variable can also contain a
	   version number:

	     $XML::SAX::ParserPackage = "XML::SAX::Expat (0.72)";

	   And the number will be treated as a minimum version number.

       o   Required features

	   It is possible to require features from the parsers. For example,
	   you may wish for a parser that supports validation via a DTD. To do
	   that, use the following code:

	     use XML::SAX::ParserFactory;
	     my $factory = XML::SAX::ParserFactory->new();
	     $factory->require_feature('http://xml.org/sax/features/validation');
	     my $parser = $factory->parser(...);

	   Alternatively, specify the required features in the call to the
	   ParserFactory constructor:

	     my $factory = XML::SAX::ParserFactory->new(
		     RequiredFeatures => {
			  'http://xml.org/sax/features/validation' => 1,
			  }
		     );

	   If the features you have asked for are unavailable (for example the
	   user might not have a validating parser installed), then an
	   exception will be thrown.

	   The list of known parsers is searched in reverse order, so it will
	   always return the last installed parser that supports all of your
	   requested features (Note: this is subject to change if someone
	   comes up with a better way of making this work).

       o   SAX.ini

	   ParserFactory will search @INC for a file called SAX.ini, which is
	   in a simple format:

	     # a comment looks like this,
	     ; or like this, and are stripped anywhere in the file
	     key = value # SAX.in contains key/value pairs.

	   All whitespace is non-significant.

	   This file can contain either a line:

	     ParserPackage = MyParserModule (1.02)

	   Where MyParserModule is the module to load and use for the parser,
	   and the number in brackets is a minimum version to load.

	   Or you can list required features:

	     http://xml.org/sax/features/validation = 1

	   And each feature with a true value will be required.

       o   Fallback

	   If none of the above works, the last parser installed on the user's
	   system will be used. The XML::SAX package ships with a pure perl
	   XML parser, XML::SAX::PurePerl, so that there will always be a
	   fallback parser.
