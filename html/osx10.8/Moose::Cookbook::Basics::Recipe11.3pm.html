NAME
       Moose::Cookbook::Basics::Recipe11 - Extending a non-Moose base class

VERSION
       version 2.0205

SYNOPSIS
	 package My::DateTime;

	 use Moose;
	 use MooseX::NonMoose;
	 extends qw( DateTime );

	 has 'mayan_date' => (
	     is        => 'ro',
	     isa       => 'DateTime::Calendar::Mayan',
	     init_arg  => undef,
	     lazy      => 1,
	     builder   => '_build_mayan_date',
	     clearer   => '_clear_mayan_date',
	     predicate => 'has_mayan_date',
	 );

	 after 'set' => sub {
	     $_[0]->_clear_mayan_date;
	 };

	 sub _build_mayan_date {
	     DateTime::Calendar::Mayan->from_object( object => $_[0] );
	 }

DESCRIPTION
       This recipe demonstrates how to use Moose to subclass a parent which is
       not Moose based. This recipe only works if the parent class uses a
       blessed hash reference for object instances. If your parent is doing
       something funkier, you should check out MooseX::NonMoose::InsideOut and
       MooseX::InsideOut.

       The meat of this recipe is contained in MooseX::NonMoose, which does
       all the grunt work for you.
