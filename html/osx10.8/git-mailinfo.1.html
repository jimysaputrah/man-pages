NAME
       git-mailinfo - Extracts patch and authorship from a single e-mail
       message

SYNOPSIS
       git mailinfo [-k|-b] [-u | --encoding=&ltencoding&gt | -n] [--scissors] &ltmsg&gt &ltpatch&gt


DESCRIPTION
       Reads a single e-mail message from the standard input, and writes the
       commit log message in &ltmsg&gt file, and the patches in &ltpatch&gt file. The
       author name, e-mail and e-mail subject are written out to the standard
       output to be used by git am to create a commit. It is usually not
       necessary to use this command directly. See git-am(1) instead.

OPTIONS
       -k
	   Usually the program removes email cruft from the Subject: header
	   line to extract the title line for the commit log message. This
	   option prevents this munging, and is most useful when used to read
	   back git format-patch -k output.

	   Specifically, the following are removed until none of them remain:

	   o   Leading and trailing whitespace.

	   o   Leading Re:, re:, and :.

	   o   Leading bracketed strings (between [ and ], usually [PATCH]).

	   Finally, runs of whitespace are normalized to a single ASCII space
	   character.

       -b
	   When -k is not in effect, all leading strings bracketed with [ and
	   ] pairs are stripped. This option limits the stripping to only the
	   pairs whose bracketed string contains the word "PATCH".

       -u
	   The commit log message, author name and author email are taken from
	   the e-mail, and after minimally decoding MIME transfer encoding,
	   re-coded in the charset specified by i18n.commitencoding
	   (defaulting to UTF-8) by transliterating them. This used to be
	   optional but now it is the default.

	   Note that the patch is always used as-is without charset
	   conversion, even with this flag.

       --encoding=&ltencoding&gt
	   Similar to -u. But when re-coding, the charset specified here is
	   used instead of the one specified by i18n.commitencoding or UTF-8.

       -n
	   Disable all charset re-coding of the metadata.

       --scissors
	   Remove everything in body before a scissors line. A line that
	   mainly consists of scissors (either "&gt8" or "8&lt") and perforation
	   (dash "-") marks is called a scissors line, and is used to request
	   the reader to cut the message at that line. If such a line appears
	   in the body of the message before the patch, everything before it
	   (including the scissors line itself) is ignored when this option is
	   used.

	   This is useful if you want to begin your message in a discussion
	   thread with comments and suggestions on the message you are
	   responding to, and to conclude it with a patch submission,
	   separating the discussion and the beginning of the proposed commit
	   log message with a scissors line.

	   This can enabled by default with the configuration option
	   mailinfo.scissors.

       --no-scissors
	   Ignore scissors lines. Useful for overriding mailinfo.scissors
	   settings.

       &ltmsg&gt
	   The commit log message extracted from e-mail, usually except the
	   title line which comes from e-mail Subject.

       &ltpatch&gt
	   The patch extracted from e-mail.
