NAME
       Encode::Detect::Detector - Detects the encoding of data

SYNOPSIS
	 use Encode::Detect::Detector;
	 my $charset = detect($octets);

	 my $d = new Encode::Detect::Detector;
	 $d->handle($octets);
	 $d->handle($more_octets);
	 $d->end;
	 my $charset = $d->getresult;

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides an interface to Mozilla's universal charset
       detector, which detects the charset used to encode data.

METHODS
   $charset = Encode::Detect::Detector->detect($octets)
       Detect the charset used to encode the data in $octets and return the
       charset's name.	Returns undef if the charset cannot be determined with
       sufficient confidence.

   $d = Encode::Detect::Detector->new()
       Creates a new "Encode::Detect::Detector" object and returns it.

   $d->handle($octets)
       Provides an additional chunk of data to be examined by the detector.
       May be called multiple times.

       Returns zero on success, nonzero if a memory allocation failed.

   $d->eof
       Informs the detector that there is no more data to be examined.	In
       many cases, this is necessary in order for the detector to make a
       decision on the charset.

   $d->reset
       Resets the detector to its initial state.

   $d->getresult
       Returns the name of the detected charset or "undef" if no charset has
       (yet) been decided upon.  May be called at any time.
