String::RewritePrefix(User Contributed Perl DocumentatString::RewritePrefix(3)



NAME
       String::RewritePrefix - rewrite strings based on a set of known
       prefixes

VERSION
       version 0.006

SYNOPSIS
	 use String::RewritePrefix;
	 my @to_load = String::RewritePrefix-&gtrewrite(
	   { '' =&gt 'MyApp::', '+' =&gt '' },
	   qw(Plugin Mixin Addon +Corporate::Thinger),
	 );

	 # now you have:
	 qw(MyApp::Plugin MyApp::Mixin MyApp::Addon Corporate::Thinger)

       You can also import a rewrite routine:

	 use String::RewritePrefix rewrite =&gt {
	   -as =&gt 'rewrite_dt_prefix',
	   prefixes =&gt { '' =&gt 'MyApp::', '+' =&gt '' },
	 };

	 my @to_load = rewrite_dt_prefix( qw(Plugin Mixin Addon +Corporate::Thinger));

	 # now you have:
	 qw(MyApp::Plugin MyApp::Mixin MyApp::Addon Corporate::Thinger)

METHODS
   rewrite
	 String::RewritePrefix-&gtrewrite(\%prefix, @strings);

       This rewrites all the given strings using the rules in %prefix.	Its
       keys are known prefixes for which its values will be substituted.  This
       is performed in longest-first order, and only one prefix will be
       rewritten.

       If the prefix value is a coderef, it will be executed with the
       remaining string as its only argument.  The return value will be used
       as the prefix.
