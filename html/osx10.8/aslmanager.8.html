NAME
     aslmanager -- Apple System Log data store file manager

SYNOPSIS
     aslmanager [-s store_dir] [-a [archive_dir]] [-ttl days] [-size max_size]

DESCRIPTION
     aslmanager manages files in the ASL data store written by the syslogd
     server.

     aslmanager is started automatically at various times.  It runs shortly
     after the syslogd server starts, upon receipt of the first message after
     midnight (local time), and any time a file in the ASL data store direc-
     tory (/var/log/asl) reaches a maximum size limit as specified to the
     syslogd server.

     Command-line options may be specified in the aslmanager launch plist
     file.  However, aslmanager reads the /etc/asl.conf file which may also
     contain parameter settings.  Settings in the asl.conf file will override
     those given on the command line.

     aslmanager scans through the files in the ASL data store directory
     /var/log/asl, or some other directory specified following the -s flag, or
     by the setting of the store_path parameter in asl.conf.  Data files that
     are older than the default 7 day time-to-live are either archived or
     removed.  Files that contain messages with explicit expire times are
     removed or archived monthly after all thier contents expire.  The default
     7 day time-to-live value may be overridden by supplying a value following
     the -ttl flag, or by the setting of the store_ttl parameter in asl.conf.
     A value of zero allows files to remain in the store with no time limit.

     A maximum size for the entire data store may be provided as a value fol-
     lowing the -size flag, or by the setting of the max_store_size parameter
     in asl.conf.  This will cause aslmanager to archive (if enabled) and
     remove files until the total size of the data store is max_size bytes or
     less.  The default value is 150000000 bytes.  A value of zero means the
     size is unlimited.  An unlimited size specification should be used with
     great caution, since a runaway process could quickly fill all available
     disk space.  Files are removed in order starting from oldest to newest.
     Files with the same date are removed in standard lexigraphic sort order
     by file name.

     Files are either removed entirely or copied to an archive directory.  If
     the -a flag is specified with no argument, files are copied to the
     /var/log/asl.archive directory.  An alternate directory path may be spec-
     ified following the -a flag.  The archive parameter setting in asl.conf
     enables or disables archiving.  The archive parameter requires a value of
     "1" to enable archiving, or a value of "0" to disable it.	An option ar-
     chive directory path may follow the "0" or "1".
