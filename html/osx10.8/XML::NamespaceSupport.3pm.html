NAME
       XML::NamespaceSupport - a simple generic namespace support class

SYNOPSIS
	 use XML::NamespaceSupport;
	 my $nsup = XML::NamespaceSupport->new;

	 # add a new empty context
	 $nsup->push_context;
	 # declare a few prefixes
	 $nsup->declare_prefix($prefix1, $uri1);
	 $nsup->declare_prefix($prefix2, $uri2);
	 # the same shorter
	 $nsup->declare_prefixes($prefix1 => $uri1, $prefix2 => $uri2);

	 # get a single prefix for a URI (randomly)
	 $prefix = $nsup->get_prefix($uri);
	 # get all prefixes for a URI (probably better)
	 @prefixes = $nsup->get_prefixes($uri);
	 # get all prefixes in scope
	 @prefixes = $nsup->get_prefixes();
	 # get all prefixes that were declared for the current scope
	 @prefixes = $nsup->get_declared_prefixes;
	 # get a URI for a given prefix
	 $uri = $nsup->get_uri($prefix);

	 # get info on a qname (java-ish way, it's a bit weird)
	 ($ns_uri, $local_name, $qname) = $nsup->process_name($qname, $is_attr);
	 # the same, more perlish
	 ($ns_uri, $prefix, $local_name) = $nsup->process_element_name($qname);
	 ($ns_uri, $prefix, $local_name) = $nsup->process_attribute_name($qname);

	 # remove the current context
	 $nsup->pop_context;

	 # reset the object for reuse in another document
	 $nsup->reset;

	 # a simple helper to process Clarkian Notation
	 my ($ns, $lname) = $nsup->parse_jclark_notation('{http://foo}bar');
	 # or (given that it doesn't care about the object
	 my ($ns, $lname) = XML::NamespaceSupport->parse_jclark_notation('{http://foo}bar');

DESCRIPTION
       This module offers a simple to process namespaced XML names (unames)
       from within any application that may need them. It also helps maintain
       a prefix to namespace URI map, and provides a number of basic checks.

       The model for this module is SAX2's NamespaceSupport class, readable at
       http://www.megginson.com/SAX/Java/javadoc/org/xml/sax/helpers/NamespaceSupport.html.
       It adds a few perlisations where we thought it appropriate.

METHODS
       o   XML::NamespaceSupport->new(\%options)

	   A simple constructor.

	   The options are "xmlns", "fatal_errors", and "auto_prefix"

	   If "xmlns" is turned on (it is off by default) the mapping from the
	   xmlns prefix to the URI defined for it in DOM level 2 is added to
	   the list of predefined mappings (which normally only contains the
	   xml prefix mapping).

	   If "fatal_errors" is turned off (it is on by default) a number of
	   validity errors will simply be flagged as failures, instead of
	   die()ing.

	   If "auto_prefix" is turned on (it is off by default) when one
	   provides a prefix of "undef" to "declare_prefix" it will generate a
	   random prefix mapped to that namespace. Otherwise an undef prefix
	   will trigger a warning (you should probably know what you're doing
	   if you turn this option on).

	   If "xmlns_11" us turned off, it becomes illegal to undeclare
	   namespace prefixes. It is on by default. This behaviour is
	   compliant with Namespaces in XML 1.1, turning it off reverts you to
	   version 1.0.

       o   $nsup->push_context

	   Adds a new empty context to the stack. You can then populate it
	   with new prefixes defined at this level.

       o   $nsup->pop_context

	   Removes the topmost context in the stack and reverts to the
	   previous one. It will die() if you try to pop more than you have
	   pushed.

       o   $nsup->declare_prefix($prefix, $uri)

	   Declares a mapping of $prefix to $uri, at the current level.

	   Note that with "auto_prefix" turned on, if you declare a prefix
	   mapping in which $prefix is undef(), you will get an automatic
	   prefix selected for you. If it is off you will get a warning.

	   This is useful when you deal with code that hasn't kept prefixes
	   around and need to reserialize the nodes. It also means that if you
	   want to set the default namespace (ie with an empty prefix) you
	   must use the empty string instead of undef. This behaviour is
	   consistent with the SAX 2.0 specification.

       o   $nsup->declare_prefixes(%prefixes2uris)

	   Declares a mapping of several prefixes to URIs, at the current
	   level.

       o   $nsup->get_prefix($uri)

	   Returns a prefix given an URI. Note that as several prefixes may be
	   mapped to the same URI, it returns an arbitrary one. It'll return
	   undef on failure.

       o   $nsup->get_prefixes($uri)

	   Returns an array of prefixes given an URI. It'll return all the
	   prefixes if the uri is undef.

       o   $nsup->get_declared_prefixes

	   Returns an array of all the prefixes that have been declared within
	   this context, ie those that were declared on the last element, not
	   those that were declared above and are simply in scope.

       o   $nsup->get_uri($prefix)

	   Returns a URI for a given prefix. Returns undef on failure.

       o   $nsup->process_name($qname, $is_attr)

	   Given a qualified name and a boolean indicating whether this is an
	   attribute or another type of name (those are differently affected
	   by default namespaces), it returns a namespace URI, local name,
	   qualified name tuple. I know that that is a rather abnormal list to
	   return, but it is so for compatibility with the Java spec. See
	   below for more Perlish alternatives.

	   If the prefix is not declared, or if the name is not valid, it'll
	   either die or return undef depending on the current setting of
	   "fatal_errors".

       o   $nsup->undeclare_prefix($prefix);

	   Removes a namespace prefix from the current context. This function
	   may be used in SAX's end_prefix_mapping when there is fear that a
	   namespace declaration might be available outside their scope (which
	   shouldn't normally happen, but you never know ;). This may be
	   needed in order to properly support Namespace 1.1.

       o   $nsup->process_element_name($qname)

	   Given a qualified name, it returns a namespace URI, prefix, and
	   local name tuple. This method applies to element names.

	   If the prefix is not declared, or if the name is not valid, it'll
	   either die or return undef depending on the current setting of
	   "fatal_errors".

       o   $nsup->process_attribute_name($qname)

	   Given a qualified name, it returns a namespace URI, prefix, and
	   local name tuple. This method applies to attribute names.

	   If the prefix is not declared, or if the name is not valid, it'll
	   either die or return undef depending on the current setting of
	   "fatal_errors".

       o   $nsup->reset

	   Resets the object so that it can be reused on another document.

       All methods of the interface have an alias that is the name used in the
       original Java specification. You can use either name interchangeably.
       Here is the mapping:

	 Java name		   Perl name
	 ---------------------------------------------------
	 pushContext		   push_context
	 popContext		   pop_context
	 declarePrefix		   declare_prefix
	 declarePrefixes	   declare_prefixes
	 getPrefix		   get_prefix
	 getPrefixes		   get_prefixes
	 getDeclaredPrefixes	   get_declared_prefixes
	 getURI 		   get_uri
	 processName		   process_name
	 processElementName	   process_element_name
	 processAttributeName	   process_attribute_name
	 parseJClarkNotation	   parse_jclark_notation
	 undeclarePrefix	   undeclare_prefix

VARIABLES
       Two global variables are made available to you. They used to be
       constants but simple scalars are easier to use in a number of contexts.
       They are not exported but can easily be accessed from any package, or
       copied into it.

       o   $NS_XMLNS

	   The namespace for xmlns prefixes, http://www.w3.org/2000/xmlns/.

       o   $NS_XML

	   The namespace for xml prefixes,
	   http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace.

TODO
	- add more tests
	- optimise here and there
