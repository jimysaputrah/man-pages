NAME
       Module::Build::Compat - Compatibility with ExtUtils::MakeMaker

SYNOPSIS
	 # In a Build.PL :
	 use Module::Build;
	 my $build = Module::Build-&gtnew
	   ( module_name =&gt 'Foo::Bar',
	     license	 =&gt 'perl',
	     create_makefile_pl =&gt 'traditional' );
	 ...

DESCRIPTION
       Because "ExtUtils::MakeMaker" has been the standard way to distribute
       modules for a long time, many tools (CPAN.pm, or your system
       administrator) may expect to find a working Makefile.PL in every
       distribution they download from CPAN.  If you want to throw them a
       bone, you can use "Module::Build::Compat" to automatically generate a
       Makefile.PL for you, in one of several different styles.

       "Module::Build::Compat" also provides some code that helps out the
       Makefile.PL at runtime.

METHODS
       create_makefile_pl($style, $build)
	   Creates a Makefile.PL in the current directory in one of several
	   styles, based on the supplied "Module::Build" object $build.  This
	   is typically controlled by passing the desired style as the
	   "create_makefile_pl" parameter to "Module::Build"'s "new()" method;
	   the Makefile.PL will then be automatically created during the
	   "distdir" action.

	   The currently supported styles are:

	   traditional
	       A Makefile.PL will be created in the "traditional" style, i.e.
	       it will use "ExtUtils::MakeMaker" and won't rely on
	       "Module::Build" at all.	In order to create the Makefile.PL,
	       we'll include the "requires" and "build_requires" dependencies
	       as the "PREREQ_PM" parameter.

	       You don't want to use this style if during the "perl Build.PL"
	       stage you ask the user questions, or do some auto-sensing about
	       the user's environment, or if you subclass "Module::Build" to
	       do some customization, because the vanilla Makefile.PL won't do
	       any of that.

	   small
	       A small Makefile.PL will be created that passes all
	       functionality through to the Build.PL script in the same
	       directory.  The user must already have "Module::Build"
	       installed in order to use this, or else they'll get a module-
	       not-found error.

	   passthrough (DEPRECATED)
	       This is just like the "small" option above, but if
	       "Module::Build" is not already installed on the user's system,
	       the script will offer to use "CPAN.pm" to download it and
	       install it before continuing with the build.

	       This option has been deprecated and may be removed in a future
	       version of Module::Build.  Modern CPAN.pm and CPANPLUS will
	       recognize the "configure_requires" metadata property and
	       install Module::Build before running Build.PL if Module::Build
	       is listed and Module::Build now adds itself to
	       configure_requires by default.

	       Perl 5.10.1 includes "configure_requires" support.  In the
	       future, when "configure_requires" support is deemed
	       sufficiently widespread, the "passthrough" style will be
	       removed.

       run_build_pl(args =&gt \@ARGV)
	   This method runs the Build.PL script, passing it any arguments the
	   user may have supplied to the "perl Makefile.PL" command.  Because
	   "ExtUtils::MakeMaker" and "Module::Build" accept different
	   arguments, this method also performs some translation between the
	   two.

	   "run_build_pl()" accepts the following named parameters:

	   args
	       The "args" parameter specifies the parameters that would
	       usually appear on the command line of the "perl Makefile.PL"
	       command - typically you'll just pass a reference to @ARGV.

	   script
	       This is the filename of the script to run - it defaults to
	       "Build.PL".

       write_makefile()
	   This method writes a 'dummy' Makefile that will pass all commands
	   through to the corresponding "Module::Build" actions.

	   "write_makefile()" accepts the following named parameters:

	   makefile
	       The name of the file to write - defaults to the string
	       "Makefile".

SCENARIOS
       So, some common scenarios are:

       1.  Just include a Build.PL script (without a Makefile.PL script), and
	   give installation directions in a README or INSTALL document
	   explaining how to install the module.  In particular, explain that
	   the user must install "Module::Build" before installing your
	   module.

	   Note that if you do this, you may make things easier for yourself,
	   but harder for people with older versions of CPAN or CPANPLUS on
	   their system, because those tools generally only understand the
	   Makefile.PL/"ExtUtils::MakeMaker" way of doing things.

       2.  Include a Build.PL script and a "traditional" Makefile.PL, created
	   either manually or with "create_makefile_pl()".  Users won't ever
	   have to install "Module::Build" if they use the Makefile.PL, but
	   they won't get to take advantage of "Module::Build"'s extra
	   features either.

	   For good measure, of course, test both the Makefile.PL and the
	   Build.PL before shipping.

       3.  Include a Build.PL script and a "pass-through" Makefile.PL built
	   using "Module::Build::Compat".  This will mean that people can
	   continue to use the "old" installation commands, and they may never
	   notice that it's actually doing something else behind the scenes.
	   It will also mean that your installation process is compatible with
	   older versions of tools like CPAN and CPANPLUS.
