NAME
       slapo-syncprov - Sync Provider overlay to slapd

SYNOPSIS
       /etc/openldap/slapd.conf

DESCRIPTION
       The  Sync Provider overlay implements the provider-side support for the
       LDAP Content Synchronization (RFC4533) as well as syncrepl  replication
       support.   The  overlay	can  be  used  with any backend that maintains
       entryCSN and entryUUID attributes for its entries. It  also  creates  a
       contextCSN attribute in the root entry of the database.

       The  contextCSN	is updated for every write operation performed against
       the database. To reduce database contention,  the  contextCSN  is  only
       updated in memory. The value is written to the database on server shut-
       down and read into memory on startup, and maintained in	memory	there-
       after.  Checkpoints  may be configured to write the contextCSN into the
       underlying database to minimize recovery time after  an	unclean  shut-
       down.

       On  databases that support inequality indexing, it is helpful to set an
       eq index on the entryCSN attribute when using this overlay.

CONFIGURATION
       These slapd.conf options apply to  the  Sync  Provider  overlay.   They
       should appear after the overlay directive.

       syncprov-checkpoint &ltops&gt &ltminutes&gt
	      After  a	write operation has succeeded, write the contextCSN to
	      the underlying database if &ltops&gt write operations or  more  than
	      &ltminutes&gt  time  have  passed  since the last checkpoint. Check-
	      pointing is disabled by default.

       syncprov-sessionlog &ltops&gt
	      Configures an in-memory session log  for	recording  information
	      about  write  operations made on the database.  The &ltops&gt speci-
	      fies the number of operations that are recorded in the log.  All
	      write  operations  (except  Adds) are recorded in the log.  When
	      using the session log, it is helpful to set an eq index  on  the
	      entryUUID attribute in the underlying database.

       syncprov-nopresent TRUE | FALSE
	      Specify  that the Present phase of refreshing should be skipped.
	      This value should only be set TRUE for a	syncprov  instance  on
	      top  of  a  log  database  (such as one managed by the accesslog
	      overlay).  The default is FALSE.

       syncprov-reloadhint TRUE | FALSE
	      Specify that the overlay should honor the reloadHint flag in the
	      Sync  Control.  In OpenLDAP releases 2.3.11 and earlier the syn-
	      crepl consumer did not properly set this flag,  so  the  overlay
	      must ignore it. This option should be set TRUE when working with
	      newer releases that properly support this flag. It must  be  set
	      TRUE  when  using the accesslog overlay for delta-based syncrepl
	      replication support.  The default is FALSE.
