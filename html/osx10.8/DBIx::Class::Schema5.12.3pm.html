NAME
       DBIx::Class::Schema - composable schemas

SYNOPSIS
	 package Library::Schema;
	 use base qw/DBIx::Class::Schema/;

	 # load all Result classes in Library/Schema/Result/
	 __PACKAGE__-&gtload_namespaces();

	 package Library::Schema::Result::CD;
	 use base qw/DBIx::Class::Core/;

	 __PACKAGE__-&gtload_components(qw/InflateColumn::DateTime/); # for example
	 __PACKAGE__-&gttable('cd');

	 # Elsewhere in your code:
	 my $schema1 = Library::Schema-&gtconnect(
	   $dsn,
	   $user,
	   $password,
	   { AutoCommit =&gt 1 },
	 );

	 my $schema2 = Library::Schema-&gtconnect($coderef_returning_dbh);

	 # fetch objects using Library::Schema::Result::DVD
	 my $resultset = $schema1-&gtresultset('DVD')-&gtsearch( ... );
	 my @dvd_objects = $schema2-&gtresultset('DVD')-&gtsearch( ... );

DESCRIPTION
       Creates database classes based on a schema. This is the recommended way
       to use DBIx::Class and allows you to use more than one concurrent
       connection with your classes.

       NB: If you're used to Class::DBI it's worth reading the "SYNOPSIS"
       carefully, as DBIx::Class does things a little differently. Note in
       particular which module inherits off which.

SETUP METHODS
   load_namespaces
       Arguments: %options?

	 __PACKAGE__-&gtload_namespaces();

	 __PACKAGE__-&gtload_namespaces(
	    result_namespace =&gt 'Res',
	    resultset_namespace =&gt 'RSet',
	    default_resultset_class =&gt '+MyDB::Othernamespace::RSet',
	 );

       With no arguments, this method uses Module::Find to load all of the
       Result and ResultSet classes under the namespace of the schema from
       which it is called.  For example, "My::Schema" will by default find and
       load Result classes named "My::Schema::Result::*" and ResultSet classes
       named "My::Schema::ResultSet::*".

       ResultSet classes are associated with Result class of the same name.
       For example, "My::Schema::Result::CD" will get the ResultSet class
       "My::Schema::ResultSet::CD" if it is present.

       Both Result and ResultSet namespaces are configurable via the
       "result_namespace" and "resultset_namespace" options.

       Another option, "default_resultset_class" specifies a custom default
       ResultSet class for Result classes with no corresponding ResultSet.

       All of the namespace and classname options are by default relative to
       the schema classname.  To specify a fully-qualified name, prefix it
       with a literal "+".  For example, "+Other::NameSpace::Result".

       Warnings

       You will be warned if ResultSet classes are discovered for which there
       are no matching Result classes like this:

	 load_namespaces found ResultSet class $classname with no corresponding Result class

       If a Result class is found to already have a ResultSet class set using
       "resultset_class" to some other class, you will be warned like this:

	 We found ResultSet class '$rs_class' for '$result', but it seems
	 that you had already set '$result' to use '$rs_set' instead

       Examples

	 # load My::Schema::Result::CD, My::Schema::Result::Artist,
	 #    My::Schema::ResultSet::CD, etc...
	 My::Schema-&gtload_namespaces;

	 # Override everything to use ugly names.
	 # In this example, if there is a My::Schema::Res::Foo, but no matching
	 #   My::Schema::RSets::Foo, then Foo will have its
	 #   resultset_class set to My::Schema::RSetBase
	 My::Schema-&gtload_namespaces(
	   result_namespace =&gt 'Res',
	   resultset_namespace =&gt 'RSets',
	   default_resultset_class =&gt 'RSetBase',
	 );

	 # Put things in other namespaces
	 My::Schema-&gtload_namespaces(
	   result_namespace =&gt '+Some::Place::Results',
	   resultset_namespace =&gt '+Another::Place::RSets',
	 );

       To search multiple namespaces for either Result or ResultSet classes,
       use an arrayref of namespaces for that option.  In the case that the
       same result (or resultset) class exists in multiple namespaces, later
       entries in the list of namespaces will override earlier ones.

	 My::Schema-&gtload_namespaces(
	   # My::Schema::Results_C::Foo takes precedence over My::Schema::Results_B::Foo :
	   result_namespace =&gt [ 'Results_A', 'Results_B', 'Results_C' ],
	   resultset_namespace =&gt [ '+Some::Place::RSets', 'RSets' ],
	 );

   load_classes
       Arguments: @classes?, { $namespace =&gt [ @classes ] }+

       "load_classes" is an alternative method to "load_namespaces", both of
       which serve similar purposes, each with different advantages and
       disadvantages.  In the general case you should use "load_namespaces",
       unless you need to be able to specify that only specific classes are
       loaded at runtime.

       With no arguments, this method uses Module::Find to find all classes
       under the schema's namespace. Otherwise, this method loads the classes
       you specify (using use), and registers them (using "register_class").

       It is possible to comment out classes with a leading "#", but note that
       perl will think it's a mistake (trying to use a comment in a qw list),
       so you'll need to add "no warnings 'qw';" before your load_classes
       call.

       If any classes found do not appear to be Result class files, you will
       get the following warning:

	  Failed to load $comp_class. Can't find source_name method. Is
	  $comp_class really a full DBIC result class? Fix it, move it elsewhere,
	  or make your load_classes call more specific.

       Example:

	 My::Schema-&gtload_classes(); # loads My::Schema::CD, My::Schema::Artist,
				     # etc. (anything under the My::Schema namespace)

	 # loads My::Schema::CD, My::Schema::Artist, Other::Namespace::Producer but
	 # not Other::Namespace::LinerNotes nor My::Schema::Track
	 My::Schema-&gtload_classes(qw/ CD Artist #Track /, {
	   Other::Namespace =&gt [qw/ Producer #LinerNotes /],
	 });

   storage_type
       Arguments: $storage_type|{$storage_type, \%args}
       Return value: $storage_type|{$storage_type, \%args}
       Default value: DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI

       Set the storage class that will be instantiated when "connect" is
       called.	If the classname starts with "::", the prefix
       "DBIx::Class::Storage" is assumed by "connect".

       You want to use this to set subclasses of DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI in
       cases where the appropriate subclass is not autodetected.

       If your storage type requires instantiation arguments, those are
       defined as a second argument in the form of a hashref and the entire
       value needs to be wrapped into an arrayref or a hashref.  We support
       both types of refs here in order to play nice with your Config::[class]
       or your choice. See DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::Replicated for an
       example of this.

   exception_action
       Arguments: $code_reference
       Return value: $code_reference
       Default value: None

       When "throw_exception" is invoked and "exception_action" is set to a
       code reference, this reference will be called instead of "throw" in
       DBIx::Class::Exception, with the exception message passed as the only
       argument.

       Your custom throw code must rethrow the exception, as "throw_exception"
       is an integral part of DBIC's internal execution control flow.

       Example:

	  package My::Schema;
	  use base qw/DBIx::Class::Schema/;
	  use My::ExceptionClass;
	  __PACKAGE__-&gtexception_action(sub { My::ExceptionClass-&gtthrow(@_) });
	  __PACKAGE__-&gtload_classes;

	  # or:
	  my $schema_obj = My::Schema-&gtconnect( .... );
	  $schema_obj-&gtexception_action(sub { My::ExceptionClass-&gtthrow(@_) });

   stacktrace
       Arguments: boolean

       Whether "throw_exception" should include stack trace information.
       Defaults to false normally, but defaults to true if $ENV{DBIC_TRACE} is
       true.

   sqlt_deploy_hook
       Arguments: $sqlt_schema

       An optional sub which you can declare in your own Schema class that
       will get passed the SQL::Translator::Schema object when you deploy the
       schema via "create_ddl_dir" or "deploy".

       For an example of what you can do with this, see "Adding Indexes And
       Functions To Your SQL" in DBIx::Class::Manual::Cookbook.

       Note that sqlt_deploy_hook is called by "deployment_statements", which
       in turn is called before "deploy". Therefore the hook can be used only
       to manipulate the SQL::Translator::Schema object before it is turned
       into SQL fed to the database. If you want to execute post-deploy
       statements which can not be generated by SQL::Translator, the currently
       suggested method is to overload "deploy" and use dbh_do.

METHODS
   connect
       Arguments: @connectinfo
       Return Value: $new_schema

       Creates and returns a new Schema object. The connection info set on it
       is used to create a new instance of the storage backend and set it on
       the Schema object.

       See "connect_info" in DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI for DBI-specific syntax
       on the @connectinfo argument, or DBIx::Class::Storage in general.

       Note that "connect_info" expects an arrayref of arguments, but
       "connect" does not. "connect" wraps its arguments in an arrayref before
       passing them to "connect_info".

       Overloading

       "connect" is a convenience method. It is equivalent to calling
       $schema-&gtclone-&gtconnection(@connectinfo). To write your own overloaded
       version, overload "connection" instead.

   resultset
       Arguments: $source_name
       Return Value: $resultset

	 my $rs = $schema-&gtresultset('DVD');

       Returns the DBIx::Class::ResultSet object for the registered source
       name.

   sources
       Return Value: @source_names

	 my @source_names = $schema-&gtsources;

       Lists names of all the sources registered on this Schema object.

   source
       Arguments: $source_name
       Return Value: $result_source

	 my $source = $schema-&gtsource('Book');

       Returns the DBIx::Class::ResultSource object for the registered source
       name.

   class
       Arguments: $source_name
       Return Value: $classname

	 my $class = $schema-&gtclass('CD');

       Retrieves the Result class name for the given source name.

   txn_do
       Arguments: $coderef, @coderef_args?
       Return Value: The return value of $coderef

       Executes $coderef with (optional) arguments @coderef_args atomically,
       returning its result (if any). Equivalent to calling
       $schema-&gtstorage-&gttxn_do.  See "txn_do" in DBIx::Class::Storage for
       more information.

       This interface is preferred over using the individual methods
       "txn_begin", "txn_commit", and "txn_rollback" below.

       WARNING: If you are connected with "AutoCommit =&gt 0" the transaction is
       considered nested, and you will still need to call "txn_commit" to
       write your changes when appropriate. You will also want to connect with
       "auto_savepoint =&gt 1" to get partial rollback to work, if the storage
       driver for your database supports it.

       Connecting with "AutoCommit =&gt 1" is recommended.

   txn_scope_guard
       Runs "txn_scope_guard" on the schema's storage. See "txn_scope_guard"
       in DBIx::Class::Storage.

   txn_begin
       Begins a transaction (does nothing if AutoCommit is off). Equivalent to
       calling $schema-&gtstorage-&gttxn_begin. See "txn_begin" in
       DBIx::Class::Storage for more information.

   txn_commit
       Commits the current transaction. Equivalent to calling
       $schema-&gtstorage-&gttxn_commit. See "txn_commit" in DBIx::Class::Storage
       for more information.

   txn_rollback
       Rolls back the current transaction. Equivalent to calling
       $schema-&gtstorage-&gttxn_rollback. See "txn_rollback" in
       DBIx::Class::Storage for more information.

   storage
	 my $storage = $schema-&gtstorage;

       Returns the DBIx::Class::Storage object for this Schema. Grab this if
       you want to turn on SQL statement debugging at runtime, or set the
       quote character. For the default storage, the documentation can be
       found in DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI.

   populate
       Arguments: $source_name, \@data;
       Return value: \@$objects | nothing

       Pass this method a resultsource name, and an arrayref of arrayrefs. The
       arrayrefs should contain a list of column names, followed by one or
       many sets of matching data for the given columns.

       In void context, "insert_bulk" in DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI is used to
       insert the data, as this is a fast method. However, insert_bulk
       currently assumes that your datasets all contain the same type of
       values, using scalar references in a column in one row, and not in
       another will probably not work.

       Otherwise, each set of data is inserted into the database using
       "create" in DBIx::Class::ResultSet, and a arrayref of the resulting row
       objects is returned.

       e.g.

	 $schema-&gtpopulate('Artist', [
	   [ qw/artistid name/ ],
	   [ 1, 'Popular Band' ],
	   [ 2, 'Indie Band' ],
	   ...
	 ]);

       Since wantarray context is basically the same as looping over
       $rs-&gtcreate(...)  you won't see any performance benefits and in this
       case the method is more for convenience. Void context sends the column
       information directly to storage using &ltDBI&gts bulk insert method. So the
       performance will be much better for storages that support this method.

       Because of this difference in the way void context inserts rows into
       your database you need to note how this will effect any loaded
       components that override or augment insert.  For example if you are
       using a component such as DBIx::Class::UUIDColumns to populate your
       primary keys you MUST use wantarray context if you want the PKs
       automatically created.

   connection
       Arguments: @args
       Return Value: $new_schema

       Similar to "connect" except sets the storage object and connection data
       in-place on the Schema class. You should probably be calling "connect"
       to get a proper Schema object instead.

       Overloading

       Overload "connection" to change the behaviour of "connect".

   compose_namespace
       Arguments: $target_namespace, $additional_base_class?
       Retur Value: $new_schema

       For each DBIx::Class::ResultSource in the schema, this method creates a
       class in the target namespace (e.g. $target_namespace::CD,
       $target_namespace::Artist) that inherits from the corresponding classes
       attached to the current schema.

       It also attaches a corresponding DBIx::Class::ResultSource object to
       the new $schema object. If $additional_base_class is given, the new
       composed classes will inherit from first the corresponding class from
       the current schema then the base class.

       For example, for a schema with My::Schema::CD and My::Schema::Artist
       classes,

	 $schema-&gtcompose_namespace('My::DB', 'Base::Class');
	 print join (', ', @My::DB::CD::ISA) . "\n";
	 print join (', ', @My::DB::Artist::ISA) ."\n";

       will produce the output

	 My::Schema::CD, Base::Class
	 My::Schema::Artist, Base::Class

   svp_begin
       Creates a new savepoint (does nothing outside a transaction).
       Equivalent to calling $schema-&gtstorage-&gtsvp_begin.  See "svp_begin" in
       DBIx::Class::Storage for more information.

   svp_release
       Releases a savepoint (does nothing outside a transaction).  Equivalent
       to calling $schema-&gtstorage-&gtsvp_release.  See "svp_release" in
       DBIx::Class::Storage for more information.

   svp_rollback
       Rollback to a savepoint (does nothing outside a transaction).
       Equivalent to calling $schema-&gtstorage-&gtsvp_rollback.  See
       "svp_rollback" in DBIx::Class::Storage for more information.

   clone
       Arguments: %attrs?
       Return Value: $new_schema

       Clones the schema and its associated result_source objects and returns
       the copy. The resulting copy will have the same attributes as the
       source schema, except for those attributes explicitly overriden by the
       provided %attrs.

   throw_exception
       Arguments: $message

       Throws an exception. Obeys the exemption rules of DBIx::Class::Carp to
       report errors from outer-user's perspective. See "exception_action" for
       details on overriding this method's behavior.  If "stacktrace" is
       turned on, "throw_exception"'s default behavior will provide a detailed
       stack trace.

   deploy
       Arguments: \%sqlt_args, $dir

       Attempts to deploy the schema to the current storage using
       SQL::Translator.

       See "METHODS" in SQL::Translator for a list of values for
       "\%sqlt_args".  The most common value for this would be "{
       add_drop_table =&gt 1 }" to have the SQL produced include a "DROP TABLE"
       statement for each table created. For quoting purposes supply
       "quote_table_names" and "quote_field_names".

       Additionally, the DBIx::Class parser accepts a "sources" parameter as a
       hash ref or an array ref, containing a list of source to deploy. If
       present, then only the sources listed will get deployed. Furthermore,
       you can use the "add_fk_index" parser parameter to prevent the parser
       from creating an index for each FK.

   deployment_statements
       Arguments: See "deployment_statements" in DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI
       Return value: $listofstatements

       A convenient shortcut to "$self-&gtstorage-&gtdeployment_statements($self,
       @args)".  Returns the SQL statements used by "deploy" and "deploy" in
       DBIx::Class::Schema::Storage.

   create_ddl_dir
       Arguments: See "create_ddl_dir" in DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI

       A convenient shortcut to "$self-&gtstorage-&gtcreate_ddl_dir($self,
       @args)".

       Creates an SQL file based on the Schema, for each of the specified
       database types, in the given directory.

   ddl_filename
       Arguments: $database-type, $version, $directory, $preversion
       Return value: $normalised_filename

	 my $filename = $table-&gtddl_filename($type, $version, $dir, $preversion)

       This method is called by "create_ddl_dir" to compose a file name out of
       the supplied directory, database type and version number. The default
       file name format is: "$dir$schema-$version-$type.sql".

       You may override this method in your schema if you wish to use a
       different format.

	WARNING

	Prior to DBIx::Class version 0.08100 this method had a different signature:

	   my $filename = $table-&gtddl_filename($type, $dir, $version, $preversion)

	In recent versions variables $dir and $version were reversed in order to
	bring the signature in line with other Schema/Storage methods. If you
	really need to maintain backward compatibility, you can do the following
	in any overriding methods:

	   ($dir, $version) = ($version, $dir) if ($DBIx::Class::VERSION &lt 0.08100);

   thaw
       Provided as the recommended way of thawing schema objects. You can call
       "Storable::thaw" directly if you wish, but the thawed objects will not
       have a reference to any schema, so are rather useless.

   freeze
       This doesn't actually do anything more than call "nfreeze" in Storable,
       it is just provided here for symmetry.

   dclone
       Arguments: $object
       Return Value: dcloned $object

       Recommended way of dcloning DBIx::Class::Row and DBIx::Class::ResultSet
       objects so their references to the schema object (which itself is not
       cloned) are properly maintained.

   schema_version
       Returns the current schema class' $VERSION in a normalised way.

   register_class
       Arguments: $moniker, $component_class

       This method is called by "load_namespaces" and "load_classes" to
       install the found classes into your Schema. You should be using those
       instead of this one.

       You will only need this method if you have your Result classes in files
       which are not named after the packages (or all in the same file). You
       may also need it to register classes at runtime.

       Registers a class which isa DBIx::Class::ResultSourceProxy. Equivalent
       to calling:

	 $schema-&gtregister_source($moniker, $component_class-&gtresult_source_instance);

   register_source
       Arguments: $moniker, $result_source

       This method is called by "register_class".

       Registers the DBIx::Class::ResultSource in the schema with the given
       moniker.

   unregister_source
       Arguments: $moniker

       Removes the DBIx::Class::ResultSource from the schema for the given
       moniker.

   register_extra_source
       Arguments: $moniker, $result_source

       As "register_source" but should be used if the result class already has
       a source and you want to register an extra one.

   compose_connection (DEPRECATED)
       Arguments: $target_namespace, @db_info
       Return Value: $new_schema

       DEPRECATED. You probably wanted compose_namespace.

       Actually, you probably just wanted to call connect.
