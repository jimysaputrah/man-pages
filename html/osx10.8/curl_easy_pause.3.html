NAME
       curl_easy_pause - pause and unpause a connection

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curl/curl.h>

       CURLcode curl_easy_pause(CURL *handle, int bitmask );


DESCRIPTION
       Using  this  function,  you can explicitly mark a running connection to
       get paused, and you  can  unpause  a  connection  that  was  previously
       paused.

       A  connection  can  be  paused by using this function or by letting the
       read or the  write  callbacks  return  the  proper  magic  return  code
       (CURL_READFUNC_PAUSE  and  CURL_WRITEFUNC_PAUSE). A write callback that
       returns pause signals to the library that it couldn't take care of  any
       data at all, and that data will then be delivered again to the callback
       when the writing is later unpaused.

       NOTE: while it may feel tempting, take care and notice that you	cannot
       call this function from another thread.

       When  this  function  is  called to unpause reading, the chance is high
       that you will get your  write  callback	called	before	this  function
       returns.

       The  handle  argument is of course identifying the handle that operates
       on the connection you want to pause or unpause.

       The bitmask argument is a set of bits that sets the new	state  of  the
       connection. The following bits can be used:

       CURLPAUSE_RECV
	      Pause  receiving	data.  There  will be no data received on this
	      connection until this function is called again without this  bit
	      set.  Thus,  the write callback (CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION) won't be
	      called.

       CURLPAUSE_SEND
	      Pause sending data. There will be no data sent on  this  connec-
	      tion  until  this function is called again without this bit set.
	      Thus, the read callback (CURLOPT_READFUNCTION) won't be  called.

       CURLPAUSE_ALL
	      Convenience define that pauses both directions.

       CURLPAUSE_CONT
	      Convenience define that unpauses both directions

RETURN VALUE
       CURLE_OK  (zero) means that the option was set properly, and a non-zero
       return code means something wrong occurred after the new state was set.
       See the libcurl-errors(3) man page for the full list with descriptions.

AVAILABILITY
       This function was added in libcurl 7.18.0. Before this  version,  there
       was no explicit support for pausing transfers.

MEMORY USE
       When  pausing  a  read  by returning the magic return code from a write
       callback, the read data is already in  libcurl's  internal  buffers  so
       it'll have to keep it in an allocated buffer until the reading is again
       unpaused using this function.

       If the downloaded data is compressed and is asked to  get  uncompressed
       automatically  on  download,  libcurl  will  continue to uncompress the
       entire downloaded chunk and it will cache the data  uncompressed.  This
       has  the side- effect that if you download something that is compressed
       a lot, it can result in a very large data amount needing  to  be  allo-
       cated to save the data during the pause. This said, you should probably
       consider not using paused reading if you allow  libcurl	to  uncompress
       data automatically.
