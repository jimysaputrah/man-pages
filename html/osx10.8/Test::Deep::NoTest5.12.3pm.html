NAME
       Test::Deep::NoTest - Use Test::Deep outside of the testing framework

SYNOPSIS
	 use Test::Deep::NoTest;

	 if eq_deeply($a, $b) {
	   print "they were deeply equal\n";
	 };

DESCRIPTION
       This exports all the same things as Test::Deep but it does not load
       Test::Builder so it can be used in ordinary non-test situations.
