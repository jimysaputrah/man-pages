NAME
       Mac::Carbon - Access to Mac OS Carbon API

SYNOPSIS
	       use Mac::Carbon;
	       use Mac::Carbon qw(:files :morefiles);

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides documentation of the Mac::Carbon modules, and acts
       as a frontend to them.

       Mac::Carbon is a collection of perl modules for accessing the Carbon
       API under Mac OS X.  It is a port of the Toolbox modules written by
       Matthias Neeracher for MacPerl.

       This module will load in all the Carbon modules, and export all of the
       functions, constants, and other variables.  An export tag is set up for
       each module, so they may be selected individually.

       This module exists primarily because in Mac OS X, all the Carbon
       functions are imported into a C program with a single header, Carbon.h,
       so Mac OS X users may prefer to load in the entire Carbon API with a
       single module.

       For detailed information on the Carbon API (highly recommended, as a
       familiarity with Carbon is assumed in the POD), see apple.com.

	       http://developer.apple.com/techpubs/macosx/Carbon/

       The documentation is also located on your system, if you have the
       Developer Tools installed, at /Developer/Documentation/Carbon/.

       Also of significant use are the related header files on your system.
       Use the `locate` command to find them.  They contain current
       documentation and notes for the API.

       The modules were written for Mac OS originally, and are in part being
       ported to Carbon.  You may also be interested in the original
       documentation.

TOOLBOX MAPPINGS
       Swiped from Mac/Toolbox.pod in the MacPerl distribution.

       The Macintosh Operating System provides a rich API with thousands of
       toolbox calls. The MacPerl toolbox modules aim to make as much as
       possible of this functionality available to MacPerl programmers. The
       mapping of the toolbox interfaces into MacPerl is intended to be

       1.  Convenient to use for Perl programmers.

       2.  As close as possible to the C interfaces.

       This translates into a mapping strategy which is discussed in the
       following sections.

   Function mappings
       MacPerl toolbox calls take their input arguments in the same order as
       the corresponding toolbox functions. Output arguments are never passed
       by reference, but returned from the calls. If there are several output
       arguments, a list is returned. If an error occurs, the function returns
       "undef" or "()" and the error code is available in the $^E variable.

	       $port = GetPort();
	       SetPort($port);
	       $desc = AECreateDesc("TEXT", "Hello, World") or die $^E;

   Data structure mappings
       Complex data structures are mapped into blessed references. Data fields
       are available through member functions which return the value of a
       field if called without an argument and change the value if called with
       an argument.

	       $rect = Rect->new(10, 20, 110, 220);
	       $rect->top;
	       $rect->right(250);

MAC OS X DIFFERENCES
       The modules follow the same API under Mac OS X as Mac OS, except that
       the non-Carbon API is not supported (for example, "NewHandle" is
       supported, but "NewHandleSys" is not).  Calling a function not
       supported by Carbon will generate an exception.

       In each module's documentation, functions that work only under Mac OS
       (non-Carbon) are marked with Mac OS only.  Those that work only under
       Mac OS X (Carbon) are marked with Mac OS X only.  A complete list is at
       the end of this document.

       The MacPerl package is automatically bootstrapped in MacPerl; it is
       included here, though the app-specific functions (Reply, Quit) are not
       supported, and the MacPerl package must be loaded explicitly (e.g.,
       "use MacPerl;").  Also, Ask/Answer/Pick are provided via AppleScript,
       talking to the SystemUIServer process.

       The Mac-specific error codes are put in $^E as in MacPerl, but $^E does
       not automatically convert the numeric error into a string in string
       context.  See brian d foy's Mac::Errors module on the CPAN for this:

	       use Mac::Errors '$MacError';
	       my $info1 = FSpGetCatInfo($file1) or die $^E + 0;    # error number
	       my $info2 = FSpGetCatInfo($file2) or die $MacError;  # error string

       Mac::Errors is not included with or required by Mac::Carbon, but it is
       highly recommended.

       $! is set at the same time $^E is set.  This is different behavior from
       MacPerl, but similar to other platforms.  On MacPerl, $^E is signed,
       and on Unix it is unsigned, so to get the numeric value from $^E, just
       add 0, as above.  Could be worse.

       Files are passed back and forth using Unix/POSIX filespecs (if you care
       about the gory details, a portion of the GUSI API has been
       reimplemented here, and it handles the conversions).  Similarly, times
       are converted back and forth from the Mac OS epoch to the Unix epoch.

       The support functions are in Carbon.h.  See that file for descriptions
       of the issues, including bugs and possibilities for bugs, involved.

64-BIT PERL
       Significant portions of the Carbon API are unavailable to 64-bit
       programs on Mac OS X.  Perhaps a subset of the API could be made
       available to a 64-bit perl (for more information see Apple's "64-Bit
       Guide for Carbon Developers"), and might in the future, but it's
       simpler at this point to just run perl in 32-bit mode.

       There's a few ways to do this.  Most obviously, you could simply build
       a 32-bit perl.  I always build my own perl, and I just compile it for
       32 bits.

       There's also two methods mentioned in "man perl" under Mac OS X 10.6:
       you can set an environment variable, or set a system preference.  For
       the environment use:

	       VERSIONER_PERL_PREFER_32_BIT=yes

       And for the system preference, execute this line in your terminal:

	       defaults write com.apple.versioner.perl Prefer-32-Bit -bool yes

INTEL ISSUES
       There are very few issues on Intel.  They mostly center around the fact
       that a Mac four-char-code is often treated as a string in Perl-space,
       but in C-space is an integer.  The conversion process results in
       various errors.

       Four-char-code types include typeType, typeEnumerated, typeProperty,
       typeKeyword, and typeApplSignature.

       There are a few Don't Do Thats to keep in mind.

       o   Don't change the type of an existing AEDesc; coerce it to a new
	   desc instead, with AECoerceDesc().  This is generally good advice
	   anyway.

       o   Don't pass four-char-codes as arguments to AEBuild*; there's no
	   easy way for the called function to know what type the argument is
	   going to be passed as, and to fix the data before it is passed.
	   Four-char-codes can be literals in AEBuild formats; this is a
	   better method to use, when possible.  For example:

		   AEBuild(q{'----':type(@)}, typeProperty);  # don't
		   AEBuild(q{'----':type(prop)});	      # do

       o   Similarly, when using AEStream, don't pass a four-char-code to
	   WriteData(), if you can avoid it.  Use one of the methods that
	   allow type specification (such as WriteDesc and WriteKeyDesc).

       o   Don't try to parse binary data when you don't have to; use the API.
	   For example, one of the example files for Mac::Speech parsed the
	   creator ID out of the binary data structure instead of calling the
	   API, and got the string reversed.

   Functions supported only in Mac OS X
       The functions below are supported only in Mac OS X, and not in Mac OS,
       either because they are newer APIs, or make no sense on Mac OS.

       Mac::Processes
	   GetProcessForPID
	   GetProcessPID
	   LSFindApplicationForInfo
       Mac::Resources
	   FSCreateResourceFile
	   FSOpenResourceFile

KNOWN BUGS
       See <http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/Bugs.html?Dist=Mac-Carbon> for more
       information.

       o   Need more tests for:

	   Mac::Memory
	       Should be more comprehensive for very little-used functions;
	       main functionality is tested OK.

	   Mac::Sound
	       Same.

	   Mac::Resources
	       Tested really only in other test suites, like Mac::Sound.
	       Should be more comprehensive.

	   Mac::Components
	       Same.

	   Mac::Files
	       Very good, but could do more exhausative FindFolder() tests.

	   Mac::Processes
	       Tests not very good, but tested pretty extensively by Mac::Glue
	       and friends.

	   Mac::MoreFiles
	       Same.

	   Mac::OSA
	       Same.

	   Mac::InternetConfig
	       No real testing done.

       o   In a few places, we need to know a text encoding, and assume it
	   (such as in LSFindApplicationForInfo(), where Latin-1 is assumed).
	   This is likely incorrect.

       o   FSSpecs are limited to 31 characters.  Ugh.	Provide access to
	   newer FSRef-based APIs.

       o   Not specific to the Carbon versions: the Mac:: modules define
	   classes such as "Handle" which probably should be something else,
	   like "Mac::Handle" or "Mac::Carbon::Handle" or
	   "Mac::Memory::Handle" (other examples include "AEDesc", "Point",
	   "Rect").  No one has really complained before except on principle,
	   but still ...

       o   Can we support XCMDs etc. via XL?  Do we want to?
