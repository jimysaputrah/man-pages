NAME
       CPANPLUS::Configure

SYNOPSIS
	   $conf   = CPANPLUS::Configure->new( );

	   $bool   = $conf->can_save;
	   $bool   = $conf->save( $where );

	   @opts   = $conf->options( $type );

	   $make       = $conf->get_program('make');
	   $verbose    = $conf->set_conf( verbose => 1 );

DESCRIPTION
       This module deals with all the configuration issues for CPANPLUS.
       Users can use objects created by this module to alter the behaviour of
       CPANPLUS.

       Please refer to the "CPANPLUS::Backend" documentation on how to obtain
       a "CPANPLUS::Configure" object.

METHODS
   $Configure = CPANPLUS::Configure->new( load_configs => BOOL )
       This method returns a new object. Normal users will never need to
       invoke the "new" method, but instead retrieve the desired object via a
       method call on a "CPANPLUS::Backend" object.

       load_configs
	   Controls whether or not additional user configurations are to be
	   loaded or not. Defaults to "true".

   $bool = $Configure->init( [rescan => BOOL])
       Initialize the configure with other config files than just the default
       'CPANPLUS::Config'.

       Called from "new()" to load user/system configurations

       If the "rescan" option is provided, your disk will be examined again to
       see if there are new config files that could be read. Defaults to
       "false".

       Returns true on success, false on failure.

   can_save( [$config_location] )
       Check if we can save the configuration to the specified file.  If no
       file is provided, defaults to your personal config.

       Returns true if the file can be saved, false otherwise.

   $file = $conf->save( [$package_name] )
       Saves the configuration to the package name you provided.  If this
       package is not "CPANPLUS::Config::System", it will be saved in your
       ".cpanplus" directory, otherwise it will be attempted to be saved in
       the system wide directory.

       If no argument is provided, it will default to your personal config.

       Returns the full path to the file if the config was saved, false
       otherwise.

   options( type => TYPE )
       Returns a list of all valid config options given a specific type (like
       for example "conf" of "program") or false if the type does not exist

ACCESSORS
       Accessors that start with a "_" are marked private -- regular users
       should never need to use these.

       See the "CPANPLUS::Config" documentation for what items can be set and
       retrieved.

   get_SOMETHING( ITEM, [ITEM, ITEM, ... ] );
       The "get_*" style accessors merely retrieves one or more desired config
       options.

   set_SOMETHING( ITEM => VAL, [ITEM => VAL, ITEM => VAL, ... ] );
       The "set_*" style accessors set the current value for one or more
       config options and will return true upon success, false on failure.

   add_SOMETHING( ITEM => VAL, [ITEM => VAL, ITEM => VAL, ... ] );
       The "add_*" style accessor adds a new key to a config key.

       Currently, the following accessors exist:

       set|get_conf
	   Simple configuration directives like verbosity and favourite shell.

       set|get_program
	   Location of helper programs.

       _set|_get_build
	   Locations of where to put what files for CPANPLUS.

       _set|_get_source
	   Locations and names of source files locally.

       _set|_get_mirror
	   Locations and names of source files remotely.

       _set|_get_fetch
	   Special settings pertaining to the fetching of files.
