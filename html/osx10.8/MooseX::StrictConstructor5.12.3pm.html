NAME
       MooseX::StrictConstructor - Make your object constructors blow up on
       unknown attributes

VERSION
       version 0.16

SYNOPSIS
	   package My::Class;

	   use Moose;
	   use MooseX::StrictConstructor;

	   has 'size' =&gt ...;

	   # then later ...

	   # this blows up because color is not a known attribute
	   My::Class-&gtnew( size =&gt 5, color =&gt 'blue' );

DESCRIPTION
       Simply loading this module makes your constructors "strict". If your
       constructor is called with an attribute init argument that your class
       does not declare, then it calls "Moose-"throw_error()&gt. This is a great
       way to catch small typos.

   Subverting Strictness
       You may find yourself wanting to have your constructor accept a
       parameter which does not correspond to an attribute.

       In that case, you'll probably also be writing a "BUILD()" or
       "BUILDARGS()" method to deal with that parameter. In a "BUILDARGS()"
       method, you can simply make sure that this parameter is not included in
       the hash reference you return. Otherwise, in a "BUILD()" method, you
       can delete it from the hash reference of parameters.

	 sub BUILD {
	     my $self	= shift;
	     my $params = shift;

	     if ( delete $params-&gt{do_something} ) {
		 ...
	     }
	 }
