NAME
       Net::DNS::Header - DNS packet header class

SYNOPSIS
       "use Net::DNS::Header;"

DESCRIPTION
       A "Net::DNS::Header" object represents the header portion of a DNS
       packet.

METHODS
   new
	   $header = Net::DNS::Header->new;

       "new" creates a header object appropriate for making a DNS query.

   parse
	   ($header, $offset) = Net::DNS::Header->parse(\$data);

       Parses the header record at the start of a DNS packet.  The argument is
       a reference to the packet data.

       Returns a Net::DNS::Header object and the offset of the next location
       in the packet.

       Parsing is aborted if the header object cannot be created (e.g.,
       corrupt or insufficient data).

   print
	   $header->print;

       Prints the header record on the standard output.

   string
	   print $header->string;

       Returns a string representation of the header object.

   id
	   print "query id = ", $header->id, "\n";
	   $header->id(1234);

       Gets or sets the query identification number.

   qr
	   print "query response flag = ", $header->qr, "\n";
	   $header->qr(0);

       Gets or sets the query response flag.

   opcode
	   print "query opcode = ", $header->opcode, "\n";
	   $header->opcode("UPDATE");

       Gets or sets the query opcode (the purpose of the query).

   aa
	   print "answer is ", $header->aa ? "" : "non-", "authoritative\n";
	   $header->aa(0);

       Gets or sets the authoritative answer flag.

   tc
	   print "packet is ", $header->tc ? "" : "not ", "truncated\n";
	   $header->tc(0);

       Gets or sets the truncated packet flag.

   rd
	   print "recursion was ", $header->rd ? "" : "not ", "desired\n";
	   $header->rd(0);

       Gets or sets the recursion desired flag.

   cd
	   print "checking was ", $header->cd ? "not" : "", "desired\n";
	   $header->cd(0);

       Gets or sets the checking disabled flag.

   ra
	   print "recursion is ", $header->ra ? "" : "not ", "available\n";
	   $header->ra(0);

       Gets or sets the recursion available flag.

   ad
	   print "The result has ", $header->ad ? "" : "not", "been verified\n"

       Relevant in DNSSEC context.

       (The AD bit is only set on answers where signatures have been
       cryptographically verified or the server is authoritative for the data
       and is allowed to set the bit by policy.)

   rcode
	   print "query response code = ", $header->rcode, "\n";
	   $header->rcode("SERVFAIL");

       Gets or sets the query response code (the status of the query).

   qdcount, zocount
	   print "# of question records: ", $header->qdcount, "\n";
	   $header->qdcount(2);

       Gets or sets the number of records in the question section of the
       packet.	In dynamic update packets, this field is known as "zocount"
       and refers to the number of RRs in the zone section.

   ancount, prcount
	   print "# of answer records: ", $header->ancount, "\n";
	   $header->ancount(5);

       Gets or sets the number of records in the answer section of the packet.
       In dynamic update packets, this field is known as "prcount" and refers
       to the number of RRs in the prerequisite section.

   nscount, upcount
	   print "# of authority records: ", $header->nscount, "\n";
	   $header->nscount(2);

       Gets or sets the number of records in the authority section of the
       packet.	In dynamic update packets, this field is known as "upcount"
       and refers to the number of RRs in the update section.

   arcount, adcount
	   print "# of additional records: ", $header->arcount, "\n";
	   $header->arcount(3);

       Gets or sets the number of records in the additional section of the
       packet.	In dynamic update packets, this field is known as "adcount".

   data
	   $hdata = $header->data;

       Returns the header data in binary format, appropriate for use in a DNS
       query packet.
