DROP FOREIGN TABLE(7)	PostgreSQL 9.1.4 Documentation	 DROP FOREIGN TABLE(7)



NAME
       DROP_FOREIGN_TABLE - remove a foreign table

SYNOPSIS
       DROP FOREIGN TABLE [ IF EXISTS ] name [, ...] [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ]

DESCRIPTION
       DROP FOREIGN TABLE removes a foreign table. Only the owner of a foreign
       table can remove it.

PARAMETERS
       IF EXISTS
	   Do not throw an error if the foreign table does not exist. A notice
	   is issued in this case.

       name
	   The name (optionally schema-qualified) of the foreign table to
	   drop.

       CASCADE
	   Automatically drop objects that depend on the foreign table (such
	   as views).

       RESTRICT
	   Refuse to drop the foreign table if any objects depend on it. This
	   is the default.

EXAMPLES
       To destroy two foreign tables, films and distributors:

	   DROP FOREIGN TABLE films, distributors;

COMPATIBILITY
       This command conforms to the ISO/IEC 9075-9 (SQL/MED), except that the
       standard only allows one foreign table to be dropped per command, and
       apart from the IF EXISTS option, which is a PostgreSQL extension.

SEE ALSO
       ALTER FOREIGN TABLE (ALTER_FOREIGN_TABLE(7)), CREATE FOREIGN TABLE
       (CREATE_FOREIGN_TABLE(7))
