NAME
       Apache::TestConfig -- Test Configuration setup module

SYNOPSIS
	 use Apache::TestConfig;

	 my $cfg = Apache::TestConfig-&gtnew(%args)
	 my $fh = $cfg-&gtgenfile($file);
	 $cfg-&gtwritefile($file, $content);
	 $cfg-&gtgendir($dir);
	 ...

DESCRIPTION
       "Apache::TestConfig" is used in creating the "Apache::Test"
       configuration files.

FUNCTIONS
       genwarning()
	     my $warn = $cfg-&gtgenwarning($filename)

	   genwarning() returns a warning string as a comment, saying that the
	   file was autogenerated and that it's not a good idea to modify this
	   file. After the warning a perl trace of calls to this this function
	   is appended. This trace is useful for finding what code has created
	   the file.

	     my $warn = $cfg-&gtgenwarning($filename, $from_filename)

	   If $from_filename is specified it'll be used in the warning to tell
	   which file it was generated from.

	   genwarning() automatically recognizes the comment type based on the
	   file extension. If the extension is not recognized, the default "#"
	   style is used.

	   Currently it support "&lt!-- --&gt", "/* ... */" and "#" styles.

       genfile()
	     my $fh = $cfg-&gtgenfile($file);

	   genfile() creates a new file $file for writing and returns a file
	   handle.

	   If parent directories of $file don't exist they will be
	   automagically created.

	   The file $file and any created parent directories (if found empty)
	   will be automatically removed on cleanup.

	   A comment with a warning and calls trace is added to the top of
	   this file. See genwarning() for more info about this comment.

	     my $fh = $cfg-&gtgenfile($file, $from_file);

	   If $from_filename is specified it'll be used in the warning to tell
	   which file it was generated from.

	     my $fh = $cfg-&gtgenfile($file, $from_file, $nowarning);

	   If $nowarning is true, the warning won't be added. If using this
	   optional argument and there is no $from_file you must pass undef as
	   in:

	     my $fh = $cfg-&gtgenfile($file, undef, $nowarning);

       writefile()
	     $cfg-&gtwritefile($file, $content, [$nowarning]);

	   writefile() creates a new file $file with the content of $content.

	   A comment with a warning and calls trace is added to the top of
	   this file unless $nowarnings is passed and set to a true value. See
	   genwarning() for more info about this comment.

	   If parent directories of $file don't exist they will be
	   automagically created.

	   The file $file and any created parent directories (if found empty)
	   will be automatically removed on cleanup.

       write_perlscript()
	     $cfg-&gtwrite_perlscript($filename, @lines);

	   Similar to writefile() but creates an executable Perl script with
	   correctly set shebang line.

       gendir()
	     $cfg-&gtgendir($dir);

	   gendir() creates a new directory $dir.

	   If parent directories of $dir don't exist they will be
	   automagically created.

	   The directory $dir and any created parent directories will be
	   automatically removed on cleanup if found empty.

Environment Variables
       The following environment variables affect the configuration and the
       run-time of the "Apache::Test" framework:

   APACHE_TEST_COLOR
       To aid visual control over the configuration process and the run-time
       phase, "Apache::Test" uses coloured fonts when the environment variable
       "APACHE_TEST_COLOR" is set to a true value.

   APACHE_TEST_LIVE_DEV
       When using "Apache::Test" during the project development phase, it's
       often convenient to have the project/lib (live) directory appearing
       first in @INC so any changes to the Perl modules, residing in it,
       immediately affect the server, without a need to rerun "make" to update
       blib/lib. When the environment variable "APACHE_TEST_LIVE_DEV" is set
       to a true value during the configuration phase ("t/TEST -config",
       "Apache::Test" will automatically unshift the project/lib directory
       into @INC, via the autogenerated t/conf/modperl_inc.pl file.

Special Placeholders
       When generating configuration files from the *.in templates, special
       placeholder variables get substituted. To embed a placeholder use the
       "@foo@" syntax. For example in extra.conf.in you can write:

	 Include @ServerRoot@/conf/myconfig.conf

       When extra.conf is generated, "@ServerRoot@" will get replaced with the
       location of the server root.

       Placeholders are case-insensitive.

       Available placeholders:

   Configuration Options
       All configuration variables that can be passed to "t/TEST", such as
       "MaxClients", "DocumentRoot", "ServerRoot", etc. To see the complete
       list run:

	 % t/TEST --help

       and you will find them in the "configuration options" sections.

   NextAvailablePort
       Every time this placeholder is encountered it'll be replaced with the
       next available port. This is very useful if you need to allocate a
       special port, but not hardcode it. Later when running:

	 % t/TEST -port=select

       it's possible to run several concurrent test suites on the same
       machine, w/o having port collisions.
