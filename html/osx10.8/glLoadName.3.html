NAME
       glLoadName - load a name onto the name stack


C SPECIFICATION
       void glLoadName( GLuint name )


PARAMETERS
       name  Specifies	a  name  that  will  replace the top value on the name
	     stack.

DESCRIPTION
       The name stack is used during selection mode to allow sets of rendering
       commands  to  be uniquely identified.  It consists of an ordered set of
       unsigned integers.  glLoadName causes name to replace the value on  the
       top of the name stack, which is initially empty.

       The  name stack is always empty while the render mode is not GL_SELECT.
       Calls to glLoadName while the render mode is not GL_SELECT are ignored.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_OPERATION  is  generated  if	glLoadName is called while the
       name stack is empty.

       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if glLoadName is executed between the
       execution of glBegin and the corresponding execution of glEnd.

ASSOCIATED GETS
       glGet with argument GL_NAME_STACK_DEPTH
       glGet with argument GL_MAX_NAME_STACK_DEPTH
