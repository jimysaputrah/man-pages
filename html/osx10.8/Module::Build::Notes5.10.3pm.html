NAME
       $notes_name - Configuration for $module_name

SYNOPSIS
	 use $notes_name;
	 \$value = $notes_name-&gtconfig('foo');
	 \$value = $notes_name-&gtfeature('bar');

	 \@names = $notes_name-&gtconfig_names;
	 \@names = $notes_name-&gtfeature_names;

	 $notes_name-&gtset_config(foo =&gt \$new_value);
	 $notes_name-&gtset_feature(bar =&gt \$new_value);
	 $notes_name-&gtwrite;  # Save changes

DESCRIPTION
       This module holds the configuration data for the $module_name module.
       It also provides a programmatic interface for getting or setting that
       configuration data.  Note that in order to actually make changes,
       you'll have to have write access to the $notes_name module, and you
       should attempt to understand the repercussions of your actions.

METHODS
       config(\$name)
	   Given a string argument, returns the value of the configuration
	   item by that name, or "undef" if no such item exists.

       feature(\$name)
	   Given a string argument, returns the value of the feature by that
	   name, or "undef" if no such feature exists.

       set_config(\$name, \$value)
	   Sets the configuration item with the given name to the given value.
	   The value may be any Perl scalar that will serialize correctly
	   using "Data::Dumper".  This includes references, objects (usually),
	   and complex data structures.  It probably does not include
	   transient things like filehandles or sockets.

       set_feature(\$name, \$value)
	   Sets the feature with the given name to the given boolean value.
	   The value will be converted to 0 or 1 automatically.

       config_names()
	   Returns a list of all the names of config items currently defined
	   in $notes_name, or in scalar context the number of items.

       feature_names()
	   Returns a list of all the names of features currently defined in
	   $notes_name, or in scalar context the number of features.

       auto_feature_names()
	   Returns a list of all the names of features whose availability is
	   dynamically determined, or in scalar context the number of such
	   features.  Does not include such features that have later been set
	   to a fixed value.

       write()
	   Commits any changes from "set_config()" and "set_feature()" to
	   disk.  Requires write access to the $notes_name module.
