NAME
       Tcl_StaticPackage  - make a statically linked package available via the
       'load' command

SYNOPSIS
       #include <tcl.h>

       Tcl_StaticPackage(interp, pkgName, initProc, safeInitProc)

ARGUMENTS
       Tcl_Interp *interp (in)			       If not NULL, points  to
						       an   interpreter   into
						       which the  package  has
						       already	 been	loaded
						       (i.e., the  caller  has
						       already	 invoked   the
						       appropriate initializa-
						       tion  procedure).  NULL
						       means the  package  has
						       not  yet  been incorpo-
						       rated into  any	inter-
						       preter.

       const char *pkgName (in) 		       Name  of  the  package;
						       should be properly cap-
						       italized  (first letter
						       upper-case, all	others
						       lower-case).

       Tcl_PackageInitProc *initProc (in)	       Procedure  to invoke to
						       incorporate this  pack-
						       age   into   a  trusted
						       interpreter.

       Tcl_PackageInitProc *safeInitProc (in)	       Procedure  to  call  to
						       incorporate  this pack-
						       age into a safe	inter-
						       preter  (one  that will
						       execute	     untrusted
						       scripts).    NULL means
						       the package  cannot  be
						       used   in  safe	inter-
						       preters.

DESCRIPTION
       This procedure may be invoked to  announce  that  a  package  has  been
       linked  statically  with a Tcl application and, optionally, that it has
       already been loaded into an interpreter.   Once	Tcl_StaticPackage  has
       been  invoked  for  a package, it may be loaded into interpreters using
       the load command.  Tcl_StaticPackage is normally invoked  only  by  the
       Tcl_AppInit  procedure  for  the application, not by packages for them-
       selves (Tcl_StaticPackage should only be invoked for statically	loaded
       packages,  and  code  in  the  package  itself  should not need to know
       whether the package is dynamically or statically loaded).

       When the load command is used later to load the package into an	inter-
       preter,	one of initProc and safeInitProc will be invoked, depending on
       whether the target interpreter is safe or not.  initProc and  safeInit-
       Proc must both match the following prototype:
	      typedef int Tcl_PackageInitProc(Tcl_Interp *interp);
       The  interp argument identifies the interpreter in which the package is
       to be loaded.  The  initialization  procedure  must  return  TCL_OK  or
       TCL_ERROR  to indicate whether or not it completed successfully; in the
       event of an error it should set the interpreter's result to point to an
       error  message.	 The result or error from the initialization procedure
       will be returned as the result of the load command that caused the ini-
       tialization procedure to be invoked.
