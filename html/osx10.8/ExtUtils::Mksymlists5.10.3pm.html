NAME
       ExtUtils::Mksymlists - write linker options files for dynamic extension

SYNOPSIS
	   use ExtUtils::Mksymlists;
	   Mksymlists({ NAME	 =&gt $name ,
			DL_VARS  =&gt [ $var1, $var2, $var3 ],
			DL_FUNCS =&gt { $pkg1 =&gt [ $func1, $func2 ],
				      $pkg2 =&gt [ $func3 ] });

DESCRIPTION
       "ExtUtils::Mksymlists" produces files used by the linker under some OSs
       during the creation of shared libraries for dynamic extensions.	It is
       normally called from a MakeMaker-generated Makefile when the extension
       is built.  The linker option file is generated by calling the function
       "Mksymlists", which is exported by default from "ExtUtils::Mksymlists".
       It takes one argument, a list of key-value pairs, in which the
       following keys are recognized:

       DLBASE
	   This item specifies the name by which the linker knows the
	   extension, which may be different from the name of the extension
	   itself (for instance, some linkers add an '_' to the name of the
	   extension).	If it is not specified, it is derived from the NAME
	   attribute.  It is presently used only by OS2 and Win32.

       DL_FUNCS
	   This is identical to the DL_FUNCS attribute available via
	   MakeMaker, from which it is usually taken.  Its value is a
	   reference to an associative array, in which each key is the name of
	   a package, and each value is an a reference to an array of function
	   names which should be exported by the extension.  For instance, one
	   might say "DL_FUNCS =&gt { Homer::Iliad =&gt [ qw(trojans greeks) ],
	   Homer::Odyssey =&gt [ qw(travellers family suitors) ] }".  The
	   function names should be identical to those in the XSUB code;
	   "Mksymlists" will alter the names written to the linker option file
	   to match the changes made by xsubpp.  In addition, if none of the
	   functions in a list begin with the string boot_, "Mksymlists" will
	   add a bootstrap function for that package, just as xsubpp does.
	   (If a boot_&ltpkg&gt function is present in the list, it is passed
	   through unchanged.)	If DL_FUNCS is not specified, it defaults to
	   the bootstrap function for the extension specified in NAME.

       DL_VARS
	   This is identical to the DL_VARS attribute available via MakeMaker,
	   and, like DL_FUNCS, it is usually specified via MakeMaker.  Its
	   value is a reference to an array of variable names which should be
	   exported by the extension.

       FILE
	   This key can be used to specify the name of the linker option file
	   (minus the OS-specific extension), if for some reason you do not
	   want to use the default value, which is the last word of the NAME
	   attribute (e.g. for "Tk::Canvas", FILE defaults to "Canvas").

       FUNCLIST
	   This provides an alternate means to specify function names to be
	   exported from the extension.  Its value is a reference to an array
	   of function names to be exported by the extension.  These names are
	   passed through unaltered to the linker options file.  Specifying a
	   value for the FUNCLIST attribute suppresses automatic generation of
	   the bootstrap function for the package. To still create the
	   bootstrap name you have to specify the package name in the DL_FUNCS
	   hash:

	       Mksymlists({ NAME     =&gt $name ,
			    FUNCLIST =&gt [ $func1, $func2 ],
			    DL_FUNCS =&gt { $pkg =&gt [] } });

       IMPORTS
	   This attribute is used to specify names to be imported into the
	   extension. It is currently only used by OS/2 and Win32.

       NAME
	   This gives the name of the extension (e.g. "Tk::Canvas") for which
	   the linker option file will be produced.

       When calling "Mksymlists", one should always specify the NAME
       attribute.  In most cases, this is all that's necessary.  In the case
       of unusual extensions, however, the other attributes can be used to
       provide additional information to the linker.
