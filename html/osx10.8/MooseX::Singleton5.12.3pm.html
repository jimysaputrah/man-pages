NAME
       MooseX::Singleton - turn your Moose class into a singleton

VERSION
       version 0.27

SYNOPSIS
	   package MyApp;
	   use MooseX::Singleton;

	   has env =&gt (
	       is      =&gt 'rw',
	       isa     =&gt 'HashRef[Str]',
	       default =&gt sub { \%ENV },
	   );

	   package main;

	   delete MyApp-&gtenv-&gt{PATH};
	   my $instance = MyApp-&gtinstance;
	   my $same = MyApp-&gtinstance;

DESCRIPTION
       A singleton is a class that has only one instance in an application.
       "MooseX::Singleton" lets you easily upgrade (or downgrade, as it were)
       your Moose class to a singleton.

       All you should need to do to transform your class is to change "use
       Moose" to "use MooseX::Singleton". This module uses metaclass roles to
       do its magic, so it should cooperate with most other "MooseX" modules.

METHODS
       A singleton class will have the following additional methods:

   Singleton-&gtinstance
       This returns the singleton instance for the given package. This method
       does not accept any arguments. If the instance does not yet exist, it
       is created with its defaults values. This means that if your singleton
       requires arguments, calling "instance" will die if the object has not
       already been initialized.

   Singleton-&gtinitialize(%args)
       This method can be called only once per class. It explicitly
       initializes the singleton object with the given arguments.

   Singleton-&gt_clear_instance
       This clears the existing singleton instance for the class. Obviously,
       this is meant for use only inside the class itself.

   Singleton-&gtnew
       This method currently works like a hybrid of "initialize" and
       "instance". However, calling "new" directly will probably be deprecated
       in a future release. Instead, call "initialize" or "instance" as
       appropriate.
