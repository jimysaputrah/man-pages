NAME
       IO::Pager - Select a pager, optionally pipe it output if destination is
       a TTY

SYNOPSIS
	 #Select a pager, sets $ENV{PAGER}
	 use IO::Pager;

	 #Optionally pipe output
	 {
	   #local $STDOUT =	IO::Pager::open *STDOUT;
	   local  $STDOUT = new IO::Pager	*STDOUT;
	   print &lt&lt"  HEREDOC" ;
	   ...
	   A bunch of text later
	   HEREDOC
	 }

DESCRIPTION
       IO::Pager is lightweight and can be used to locate an available pager
       and set $ENV{PAGER} (see "NOTES") or as a factory for creating objects
       defined elsewhere such as IO::Pager::Buffered and
       IO::Pager::Unbuffered.

       IO::Pager subclasses are designed to programmatically decide whether or
       not to pipe a filehandle's output to a program specified in
       $ENV{PAGER}.  Subclasses are only required to support filehandle output
       methods and close, namely

       CLOSE
	   Supports close() of the filehandle.

       PRINT
	   Supports print() to the filehandle.

       PRINTF
	   Supports printf() to the filehandle.

       WRITE
	   Supports syswrite() to the filehandle.

       For anything else, YMMV.

   new( [FILEHANDLE], [EXPR] )
       Instantiate a new IO::Pager to paginate FILEHANDLE if necessary.
       Assign the return value to a scoped variable.

       See the appropriate subclass for implementation specific details.

       FILEHANDLE
	   Defaults to currently select()-ed FILEHANDLE.

       EXPR
	   An expression which evaluates to the subclass of object to create.

	   Defaults to IO::Pager::Unbuffered.

   open( [FILEHANDLE], [EXPR] )
       An alias for new.

   close( FILEHANDLE )
       Explicitly close the filehandle, this stops any redirection of output
       on FILEHANDLE that may have been warranted. Normally you'd just wait
       for the object to pass out of scope.

       This does not default to the current filehandle.

       See the appropriate subclass for implementation specific details.

ENVIRONMENT
       PAGER
	   The location of the default pager.

       PATH
	   If PAGER does not specify an absolute path for the binary PATH may
	   be used.

	   See "NOTES" for more information.

FILES
       IO::Pager may fall back to these binaries in order if $ENV{PAGER} is
       not executable.

       /usr/local/bin/less
       /usr/bin/less
       /usr/bin/more

       See "NOTES" for more information.

NOTES
       The algorythm for determining which pager is to use as follows:

       1. Defer to $ENV{PAGER}
	   Use the value of $ENV{PAGER} if it exists unless File::Which is
	   available and the pager in $ENV{PAGER} is determined to be
	   unavailable.

       2. Usual suspects
	   Try the standard, hardcoded paths in "FILES".

       3. File::Which
	   If File::Which is available check for "less" and more.

       4. more
	   Set $ENV{PAGER} to "more"

       Steps 1, 3 and 4 rely upon $ENV{PATH}.
