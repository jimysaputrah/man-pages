NAME
       DateTime::TimeZone::Local::Unix - Determine the local system's time
       zone on Unix

VERSION
       version 1.41

SYNOPSIS
	 my $tz = DateTime::TimeZone->new( name => 'local' );

	 my $tz = DateTime::TimeZone::Local->TimeZone();

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides methods for determining the local time zone on a
       Unix platform.

HOW THE TIME ZONE IS DETERMINED
       This class tries the following methods of determining the local time
       zone:

       o   $ENV{TZ}

	   It checks $ENV{TZ} for a valid time zone name.

       o   /etc/localtime

	   If this file is a symlink to an Olson database time zone file
	   (usually in /usr/share/zoneinfo) then it uses the target file's
	   path name to determine the time zone name. For example, if the path
	   is /usr/share/zoneinfo/America/Chicago, the time zone is
	   "America/Chicago".

	   Some systems just copy the relevant file to /etc/localtime instead
	   of making a symlink.  In this case, we look in /usr/share/zoneinfo
	   for a file that has the same size and content as /etc/localtime to
	   determine the local time zone.

       o   /etc/timezone

	   If this file exists, it is read and its contents are used as a time
	   zone name.

       o   /etc/TIMEZONE

	   If this file exists, it is opened and we look for a line starting
	   like "TZ = ...". If this is found, it should indicate a time zone
	   name.

       o   /etc/sysconfig/clock

	   If this file exists, it is opened and we look for a line starting
	   like "TIMEZONE = ..." or "ZONE = ...". If this is found, it should
	   indicate a time zone name.

       o   /etc/default/init

	   If this file exists, it is opened and we look for a line starting
	   like "TZ=...". If this is found, it should indicate a time zone
	   name.
