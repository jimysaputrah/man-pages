NAME
       gluBuild3DMipmaps - builds a three-dimensional mipmap


C SPECIFICATION
       GLint gluBuild3DMipmaps( GLenum target,
				GLint internalFormat,
				GLsizei width,
				GLsizei height,
				GLsizei depth,
				GLenum format,
				GLenum type,
				const void *data )


PARAMETERS
       target	       Specifies the target texture.  Must be GL_TEXTURE_3D.

       internalFormat  Requests  the  internal	storage  format of the texture
		       image.  The most current version of the SGI implementa-
		       tion  of  GLU  does  not  check this value for validity
		       before passing it on to the underlying OpenGL implemen-
		       tation.	 A  value  that  is not accepted by the OpenGL
		       implementation will lead to an OpenGL error.  The bene-
		       fit of not checking this value at the GLU level is that
		       OpenGL extensions can add new internal texture  formats
		       without requiring a revision of the GLU implementation.
		       Older implementations of GLU check this value and raise
		       a  GLU  error  if it is not 1, 2, 3, or 4 or one of the
		       following  symbolic  constants:	GL_ALPHA,   GL_ALPHA4,
		       GL_ALPHA8,    GL_ALPHA12,   GL_ALPHA16,	 GL_LUMINANCE,
		       GL_LUMINANCE4,	   GL_LUMINANCE8,      GL_LUMINANCE12,
		       GL_LUMINANCE16,			   GL_LUMINANCE_ALPHA,
		       GL_LUMINANCE4_ALPHA4,		 GL_LUMINANCE6_ALPHA2,
		       GL_LUMINANCE8_ALPHA8,		GL_LUMINANCE12_ALPHA4,
		       GL_LUMINANCE12_ALPHA12,	       GL_LUMINANCE16_ALPHA16,
		       GL_INTENSITY,	   GL_INTENSITY4,	GL_INTENSITY8,
		       GL_INTENSITY12,	GL_INTENSITY16,  GL_RGB,  GL_R3_G3_B2,
		       GL_RGB4,    GL_RGB5,   GL_RGB8,	 GL_RGB10,   GL_RGB12,
		       GL_RGB16,  GL_RGBA,  GL_RGBA2,  GL_RGBA4,   GL_RGB5_A1,
		       GL_RGBA8, GL_RGB10_A2, GL_RGBA12, or GL_RGBA16.

       width, height, depth
		       Specifies in pixels the width, height and depth respec-
		       tively, in pixels of the texture image.

       format	       Specifies the format of the pixel data.	Must be one of
		       GL_COLOR_INDEX,	GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT,  GL_RED, GL_GREEN,
		       GL_BLUE, GL_ALPHA, GL_RGB,  GL_RGBA,  GL_BGR,  GL_BGRA,
		       GL_LUMINANCE, or GL_LUMINANCE_ALPHA.

       type	       Specifies  the  data  type  for	data.  Must be one of:
		       GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE,	  GL_BYTE,	    GL_BITMAP,
		       GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT,  GL_SHORT,  GL_UNSIGNED_INT, GL_INT,
		       GL_FLOAT,		       GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE_3_3_2,
		       GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE_2_3_3_REV,    GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT_5_6_5,
		       GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT_5_6_5_REV, GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT_4_4_4_4,
		       GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT_4_4_4_4_REV,
		       GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT_5_5_5_1,
		       GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT_1_5_5_5_REV, GL_UNSIGNED_INT_8_8_8_8,
		       GL_UNSIGNED_INT_8_8_8_8_REV,
		       GL_UNSIGNED_INT_10_10_10_2,			    or
		       GL_UNSIGNED_INT_2_10_10_10_REV.

       data	       Specifies a pointer to the image data in memory.

DESCRIPTION
       gluBuild3DMipmaps builds a series of prefiltered three-dimensional tex-
       ture  maps  of decreasing resolutions called a mipmap. This is used for
       the antialiasing of texture-mapped primitives.

       A return value of zero indicates success, otherwise a GLU error code is
       returned (see gluErrorString).

       Initially,  the	width,	height and depth of data are checked to see if
       they are a power of 2. If not, a copy of data (not data), is scaled  up
       or  down  to  the  nearest  power  of  2. (If width, height or depth is
       exactly between powers of 2, then the copy of data will scale upwards.)
       This  copy  will be used for subsequent mipmapping operations described
       below.  For example, if width is 57, height is 23 and depth is 24  then
       a  copy	of data will scale up to 64 in width, down to 16 in height and
       up to 32 in depth, before mipmapping takes place.

       Then, proxy textures (see glTexImage3D) are used to  determine  if  the
       implementation  can fit the requested texture. If not, all three dimen-
       sions are continually halved until it fits.

       Next, a series of mipmap levels is built by decimating a copy  of  data
       in half along all three dimensions until size 1x1x1 is reached. At each
       level, each texel in the halved mipmap level is an average of the  cor-
       responding  eight texels in the larger mipmap level. (If exactly one of
       the dimensions is 1, four texels are averaged.  If exactly two  of  the
       dimensions are 1, two texels are averaged.)

       glTexImage3D is called to load each of these mipmap levels.  Level 0 is
       a  copy	of  data.   The  highest  level  is  {log   sub   2}   (   max
       ("width","height","depth")).  For example, if width is 64, height is 16
       and depth is 32, and the implementation can store  a  texture  of  this
       size, the following mipmap levels are built: 64x16x32, 32x8x16, 16x4x8,
       8x2x4, 4x1x2, 2x1x1 and 1x1x1. These correspond to levels 0 through  6,
       respectively.

       See the glTexImage1D reference page for a description of the acceptable
       values for format parameter. See the glDrawPixels reference page for  a
       description of the acceptable values for type parameter.

NOTES
       Note  that  there  is no direct way of querying the maximum level. This
       can be derived indirectly via glGetTexLevelParameter. First, query  for
       the  width,  height  and  depth	actually used at level 0.  (The width,
       height and depth may not be equal to width, height  and	depth  respec-
       tively since proxy textures might have scaled them to fit the implemen-
       tation.)  Then the maximum level can be derived from the formula log2 (
       max (width,height,depth)).

       greater.
