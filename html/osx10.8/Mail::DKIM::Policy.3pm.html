NAME
       Mail::DKIM::Policy - abstract base class for originator "signing"
       policies

SYNOPSIS
	 # get all policies that apply to a verified message
	 foreach my $policy ($dkim->policies)
	 {

	     # the name of this policy
	     my $name = $policy->name;

	     # the location in DNS where this policy was found
	     my $location = $policy->location;

	     # apply this policy to the message being verified
	     my $result = $policy->apply($dkim);

	 }

DESCRIPTION
       Between the various versions of the DomainKeys/DKIM standards, several
       different forms of sender "signing" policies have been defined.	In
       order for the Mail::DKIM library to support these different policies,
       it uses several different subclasses. All subclasses support this
       general interface, so that a program using Mail::DKIM can support any
       and all policies found for a message.

METHODS
       These methods are supported by all classes implementing the
       Mail::DKIM::Policy interface.

   apply()
       Apply the policy to the results of a DKIM verifier.

	 my $result = $policy->apply($dkim_verifier);

       The caller must provide an instance of Mail::DKIM::Verifier, one which
       has already been fed the message being verified.

       Possible results are:

       accept
	   The message is approved by the sender signing policy.

       reject
	   The message is rejected by the sender signing policy.

       neutral
	   The message is neither approved nor rejected by the sender signing
	   policy. It can be considered suspicious.

   as_string()
       The policy as a string.

       Note that the string returned by this method will not necessarily have
       the tags ordered the same as the text record found in DNS.

   is_implied_default_policy()
       Is this policy implied?

	 my $is_implied = $policy->is_implied_default_policy;

       If you fetch the policy for a particular domain, but that domain does
       not have a policy published, then the "default policy" is in effect.
       Use this method to detect when that happens.

   location()
       Where the policy was fetched from.

       This is generally a domain name, the domain name where the policy was
       published.

       If nothing is published for the domain, and the default policy was
       returned instead, the location will be "undef".

   name()
       Identify what type of policy this is.

       This currently returns strings like "sender", "author", and "ADSP".  It
       is subject to change in the next version of Mail::DKIM.
