COMMIT PREPARED(7)	PostgreSQL 9.1.4 Documentation	    COMMIT PREPARED(7)



NAME
       COMMIT_PREPARED - commit a transaction that was earlier prepared for
       two-phase commit

SYNOPSIS
       COMMIT PREPARED transaction_id

DESCRIPTION
       COMMIT PREPARED commits a transaction that is in prepared state.

PARAMETERS
       transaction_id
	   The transaction identifier of the transaction that is to be
	   committed.

NOTES
       To commit a prepared transaction, you must be either the same user that
       executed the transaction originally, or a superuser. But you do not
       have to be in the same session that executed the transaction.

       This command cannot be executed inside a transaction block. The
       prepared transaction is committed immediately.

       All currently available prepared transactions are listed in the
       pg_prepared_xacts system view.

EXAMPLES
       Commit the transaction identified by the transaction identifier foobar:

	   COMMIT PREPARED 'foobar';

SEE ALSO
       PREPARE TRANSACTION (PREPARE_TRANSACTION(7)), ROLLBACK PREPARED
       (ROLLBACK_PREPARED(7))
