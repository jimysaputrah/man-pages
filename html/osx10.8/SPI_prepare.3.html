NAME
       SPI_prepare - prepare a plan for a command, without executing it yet

SYNOPSIS
       SPIPlanPtr SPI_prepare(const char * command, int nargs, Oid * argtypes)

DESCRIPTION
       SPI_prepare creates and returns an execution plan for the specified
       command, but doesn't execute the command. This function should only be
       called from a connected procedure.

       When the same or a similar command is to be executed repeatedly, it
       might be advantageous to perform the planning only once.  SPI_prepare
       converts a command string into an execution plan that can be executed
       repeatedly using SPI_execute_plan.

       A prepared command can be generalized by writing parameters ($1, $2,
       etc.) in place of what would be constants in a normal command. The
       actual values of the parameters are then specified when
       SPI_execute_plan is called. This allows the prepared command to be used
       over a wider range of situations than would be possible without
       parameters.

       The plan returned by SPI_prepare can be used only in the current
       invocation of the procedure, since SPI_finish frees memory allocated
       for a plan. But a plan can be saved for longer using the function
       SPI_saveplan.

ARGUMENTS
       const char * command
	   command string

       int nargs
	   number of input parameters ($1, $2, etc.)

       Oid * argtypes
	   pointer to an array containing the OIDs of the data types of the
	   parameters

RETURN VALUE
       SPI_prepare returns a non-null pointer to an execution plan. On error,
       NULL will be returned, and SPI_result will be set to one of the same
       error codes used by SPI_execute, except that it is set to
       SPI_ERROR_ARGUMENT if command is NULL, or if nargs is less than 0, or
       if nargs is greater than 0 and argtypes is NULL.

NOTES
       SPIPlanPtr is declared as a pointer to an opaque struct type in spi.h.
       It is unwise to try to access its contents directly, as that makes your
       code much more likely to break in future revisions of PostgreSQL.

       There is a disadvantage to using parameters: since the planner does not
       know the values that will be supplied for the parameters, it might make
       worse planning choices than it would make for a normal command with all
       constants visible.
