NAME
       Module::Build::Platform::VMS - Builder class for VMS platforms

DESCRIPTION
       This module inherits from "Module::Build::Base" and alters a few minor
       details of its functionality.  Please see Module::Build for the general
       docs.

   Overridden Methods
       _set_defaults
	   Change $self-&gt{build_script} to 'Build.com' so @Build works.

       cull_args
	   '@Build foo' on VMS will not preserve the case of 'foo'.  Rather
	   than forcing people to write '@Build "foo"' we'll dispatch case-
	   insensitively.

       manpage_separator
	   Use '__' instead of '::'.

       prefixify
	   Prefixify taking into account VMS' filepath syntax.

       _quote_args
	   Command-line arguments (but not the command itself) must be quoted
	   to ensure case preservation.

       have_forkpipe
	   There is no native fork(), so some constructs depending on it are
	   not available.

       _backticks
	   Override to ensure that we quote the arguments but not the command.

       find_command
	   Local an executable program

       _maybe_command (override)
	   Follows VMS naming conventions for executable files.  If the name
	   passed in doesn't exactly match an executable file, appends .Exe
	   (or equivalent) to check for executable image, and .Com to check
	   for DCL procedure.  If this fails, checks directories in DCL$PATH
	   and finally Sys$System: for an executable file having the name
	   specified, with or without the .Exe-equivalent suffix.

       do_system
	   Override to ensure that we quote the arguments but not the command.

       oneliner
	   Override to ensure that we do not quote the command.

       _infer_xs_spec
	   Inherit the standard version but tweak the library file name to be
	   something Dynaloader can find.

       rscan_dir
	   Inherit the standard version but remove dots at end of name.  If
	   the extended character set is in effect, do not remove dots from
	   filenames with Unix path delimiters.

       dist_dir
	   Inherit the standard version but replace embedded dots with
	   underscores because a dot is the directory delimiter on VMS.

       man3page_name
	   Inherit the standard version but chop the extra manpage delimiter
	   off the front if there is one.  The VMS version of
	   splitdir('[.foo]') returns '', 'foo'.

       expand_test_dir
	   Inherit the standard version but relativize the paths as the native
	   glob() doesn't do that for us.

       _detildefy
	   The home-grown glob() does not currently handle tildes, so provide
	   limited support here.  Expect only UNIX format file specifications
	   for now.

       find_perl_interpreter
	   On VMS, $^X returns the fully qualified absolute path including
	   version number.  It's logically impossible to improve on it for
	   getting the perl we're currently running, and attempting to
	   manipulate it is usually lossy.

       localize_file_path
	   Convert the file path to the local syntax

       localize_dir_path
	   Convert the directory path to the local syntax

       ACTION_clean
	   The home-grown glob() expands a bit too aggressively when given a
	   bare name, so default in a zero-length extension.
