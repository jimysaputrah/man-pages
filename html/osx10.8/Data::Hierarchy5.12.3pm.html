NAME
       Data::Hierarchy - Handle data in a hierarchical structure

SYNOPSIS
	   my $tree = Data::Hierarchy->new();
	   $tree->store ('/', {access => 'all'});
	   $tree->store ('/private', {access => 'auth',
				      '.note' => 'this is private});

	   $info = $tree->get ('/private/somewhere/deep');

	   # return actual data points in list context
	   ($info, @fromwhere) = $tree->get ('/private/somewhere/deep');

	   my @items = $tree->find ('/', {access => qr/.*/});

	   # override all children
	   $tree->store ('/', {'.note' => undef}, {override_sticky_descendents => 1});

DESCRIPTION
       Data::Hierarchy provides a simple interface for manipulating
       inheritable data attached to a hierarchical environment (like a
       filesystem).

       One use of Data::Hierarchy is to allow an application to annotate paths
       in a real filesystem in a single compact data structure. However, the
       hierarchy does not actually need to correspond to an actual filesystem.

       Paths in a hierarchy are referred to in a Unix-like syntax; "/" is the
       root "directory". (You can specify a different separator character than
       the slash when you construct a Data::Hierarchy object.)	With the
       exception of the root path, paths should never contain trailing
       slashes. You can associate properties, which are arbitrary name/value
       pairs, with any path.  (Properties cannot contain the undefined value.)
       By default, properties are inherited by child paths: thus, if you store
       some data at "/some/path":

	   $tree->store('/some/path', {color => 'red'});

       you can fetch it again at a "/some/path/below/that":

	   print $tree->get('/some/path/below/that')->{'color'};
	   # prints red

       On the other hand, properties whose names begin with dots are
       uninherited, or "sticky":

	   $tree->store('/some/path', {'.color' => 'blue'});
	   print $tree->get('/some/path')->{'.color'};		  # prints blue
	   print $tree->get('/some/path/below/that')->{'.color'}; # undefined

       Note that you do not need to (and in fact, cannot) explicitly add
       "files" or "directories" to the hierarchy; you simply add and delete
       properties to paths.

CONSTRUCTOR
       Creates a new hierarchy object.	Takes the following options:

       sep The string used as a separator between path levels. Defaults to
	   '/'.

METHODS
   Instance Methods
       "store $path, $properties, {%options}"
	   Given a path and a hash reference of properties, stores the
	   properties at the path.

	   Unless the "override_descendents" option is given with a false
	   value, it eliminates any non-sticky property in a descendent of
	   $path with the same name.

	   If the "override_sticky_descendents" option is given with a true
	   value, it eliminates any sticky property in a descendent of $path
	   with the same name.	override it.

	   A value of undef removes that value; note, though, that if an
	   ancestor of $path defines that property, the ancestor's value will
	   be inherited there; that is, with:

	       $t->store('/a',	 {k => 'top'});
	       $t->store('/a/b', {k => 'bottom'});
	       $t->store('/a/b', {k => undef});
	       print $t->get('/a/b')->{'k'};

	   it will print 'top'.

       "get $path, [$dont_clone]"
	   Given a path, looks up all of the properteies (sticky and not) and
	   returns them in a hash reference.  The values are clones, unless
	   you pass a true value for $dont_clone.

	   If called in list context, returns that hash reference followed by
	   all of the ancestral paths of $path which contain non-sticky
	   properties (possibly including itself).

       "find $path, $property_regexps"
	   Given a path and a hash reference of name/regular expression pairs,
	   returns a list of all paths which are descendents of $path
	   (including itself) and define at that path itself (not inherited)
	   all of the properties in the hash with values matching the given
	   regular expressions.  (You may want to use "qr/.*/" to merely see
	   if it has any value defined there.)	Properties can be sticky or
	   not.

       "merge $other_hierarchy, $path"
	   Given a second Data::Hierarchy object and a path, copies all the
	   properties from the other object at $path or below into the
	   corresponding paths in the object this method is invoked on.  All
	   properties from the object this is invoked on at $path or below are
	   erased first.

       "to_relative $base_path"
	   Given a path which every element of the hierarchy must be contained
	   in, returns a special Data::Hierarchy::Relative object which
	   represents the hierarchy relative that path. The only thing you can
	   do with a Data::Hierarchy::Relative object is call
	   "to_absolute($new_base_path)" on it, which returns a new
	   Data::Hierarchy object at that base path. For example, if
	   everything in the hierarchy is rooted at "/home/super_project" and
	   it needs to be moved to "/home/awesome_project", you can do

	       $hierarchy = $hierarchy->to_relative('/home/super_project')->to_absolute('/home/awesome_project');

	   (Data::Hierarchy::Relative objects may be a more convenient
	   serialization format than Data::Hierarchy objects, if they are
	   tracking the state of some relocatable resource.)
