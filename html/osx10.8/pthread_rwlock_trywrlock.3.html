PTHREAD_RWLOCK_WRLOCK(3) BSD Library Functions Manual PTHREAD_RWLOCK_WRLOCK(3)

NAME
     pthread_rwlock_trywrlock, pthread_rwlock_wrlock -- acquire a read/write
     lock for writing

SYNOPSIS
     #include &ltpthread.h&gt

     int
     pthread_rwlock_trywrlock(pthread_rwlock_t *rwlock);

     int
     pthread_rwlock_wrlock(pthread_rwlock_t *rwlock);

DESCRIPTION
     The pthread_rwlock_wrlock() function blocks until a write lock can be
     acquired against rwlock.  The pthread_rwlock_trywrlock() function per-
     forms the same action, but does not block if the lock cannot be immedi-
     ately obtained.

     The results are undefined if the calling thread already holds the lock at
     the time the call is made.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
     To prevent writer starvation, writers are favored over readers.

RETURN VALUES
     If successful, the pthread_rwlock_wrlock() and pthread_rwlock_trywrlock()
     functions will return zero.  Otherwise, an error number will be returned
     to indicate the error.

SEE ALSO
     pthread_rwlock_trywrlock(3), pthread_rwlock_unlock(3),
     pthread_rwlock_wrlock(3)

STANDARDS
     The pthread_rwlock_wrlock() and pthread_rwlock_trywrlock() functions are
     expected to conform to Version 2 of the Single UNIX Specification
     (``SUSv2'').

ERRORS
     The pthread_rwlock_trywrlock() function will fail if:

     [EBUSY]		The calling thread is not able to acquire the lock
			without blocking.

     The pthread_rwlock_wrlock() and pthread_rwlock_trywrlock() functions may
     fail if:

     [EDEADLK]		The calling thread already owns the read/write lock
			(for reading or writing).

     [EINVAL]		The value specified by rwlock is invalid.

     [ENOMEM]		Insufficient memory exists to initialize the lock
			(applies to statically initialized locks only).

HISTORY
     The pthread_rwlock_wrlock() function first appeared in FreeBSD 3.0.
