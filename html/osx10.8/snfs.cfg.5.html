NAME
       snfs.cfg - Xsan Volume Configuration File

SYNOPSIS
       This  page  describes  the  old	Volume configuration file format, used
       prior to Xsan 4.0.

       A volume name is associated to its configuration  file  by  the	file's
       prefix.	 For example, if the volume were named projecta, then its con-
       figuration file would be /Library/Preferences/Xsan/projecta.cfg.  There
       may  be	multiple  volumes  simultaneously mounted, with an FSM program
       running for each active volume.	Configuration files must reside on the
       same system as the FSM processes that use them.

DEPRECATED
       This  format  has  been	deprecated  in favor of the cfgx format on all
       platforms except Windows - see snfs.cfgx(5) for details on the new for-
       mat.


SYNTAX
       Each configuration file has several section headers and section bodies.
       A section header is enclosed by square brackets as follows:

	       [ Keyword Name ]

       A section body is the non-bracketed lines of configuration between sec-
       tion headers.

       Every  configuration  file  begins with a Global section body; a Global
       section header is implied.  In addition to the implicitly named	Global
       section,  other	section-header	keyword  values are DiskType, Disk and
       StripeGroup.  Section-header keywords are case insensitive.

       Section names consist of case-sensitive letters,  numbers,  underscores
       (_), and dashes (-).

       Each line of a section body has the following syntax:

	       Keyword Value

       Section-body keyword names are section dependent as described below.

       Section-body values can be a number, name or any combination of charac-
       ters enclosed by double quotes (").  A number can be in octal,  decimal
       or  hexadecimal.  Octal numbers are represented by prefixing the number
       with 0, and hexadecimal numbers are represented by prefixing the number
       with 0x.

       A  suffix  of  m  or  M	indicates  a  mega multiplier, which is 2^20 =
       1,048,576.  For example the value 3M results in	an  integer  value  of
       3,145,728.

       Following is the list of case-insensitive multiplier suffixes:

	  Suffix    Name    Multiplier
	  ------    ----    ----------
	    K	    kilo    1,024
	    M	    mega    1,048,576
	    G	    giga    1,073,741,824
	    T	    tera    1,099,511,627,776

       In some cases of specifying disk space, a suffix changes the meaning of
       the parameter.  A number alone implies blocks while  a  number  with  a
       suffix  implies bytes.  Following are the keywords configured in blocks
       by default, or bytes when a multiplier suffix is used:

	  Keyword
	  -------
	  InodeExpandMin
	  InodeExpandInc
	  InodeExpandMax
	  InodeStripeWidth
	  PerfectFitSize
	  StripeAlignSize
	  StripeBreadth

       Comments start anywhere a pound sign (#) occurs, and  continue  to  the
       end of that line.  The following are valid comment strings:

	      # This is a comment line
	      #     Text after and including a # sign on any line is ignored.
	      # 	      vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
	      FsBlockSize 4k  # The file system block size is 4096 bytes.


SECTIONS SUMMARY
       The  configuration  file  has  four section types that are delimited by
       square-bracketed section-header lines as described  above.   The  first
       section	type  is  the  Global  section, which does not have a section-
       header line.  It occurs only once, at the start of the file,  and  ends
       with  the  first  bracketed  section-header  line.   The Global section
       defines configuration attributes that affect table sizes,  file	system
       caches and performance factors for the volume.

       The  remaining sections are DiskTypes, Disk and StripeGroup.  These may
       occur any number of times and in any order.

       Each DiskTypes section defines an instance of a valid disk type.   This
       is  simply a category of disk device and the disk device's size in sec-
       tors.

       The Disk section describes individual disk devices that are  configured
       in the volume. The name of the disk device must be placed in the volume
       header label using cvlabel(1).  This is how  the  disk  devices	become
       associated with an Xsan disk name.

       The  StripeGroup  section  describes a group of Disk entities that com-
       prise a storage pool.  One or more storage pools  describe  the	entire
       volume.	 A storage pool is the smallest entity that can be manipulated
       by administration  commands,  such  as  cvadmin(1).  Even  though  disk
       devices	may  be  brought  up or down, this has the effect of upping or
       downing the entire storage pool.  The StripeGroup can be either read or
       write  disabled.   The storage pool is still up, but one or more of the
       related group's disks are disabled. When a storage pool is  write  dis-
       abled, no further allocations are permitted on the group.

       NOTE:  Several  releases ago, there was a section called MediaType that
       defined Affinity names before they were used in a StripeGroup  section.
       Affinities   no	 longer   need	to  be	defined  separately  from  the
       StripeGroup, and if upgrading from a volume  that  used	the  MediaType
       section, it must be removed or it will cause parser errors.


DEFAULT GLOBAL VALUES
       The  following defaults, minimums, and maximums are allowed for modifi-
       able global variables.  NOTE: the Default Value is in effect  when  the
       global  variable is absent from the configuration file.	Graphical user
       interfaces and command-line tools such as sncfgedit may create configu-
       ration files containing globals variables with initial values that dif-
       fer from the Default Value below.

DEPRECATED GLOBAL OPTIONS
       The following global options have been deprecated


     o AllocSessionReservation <Yes|No>

       The  AllocSessionReservation  parameter has been replaced by the Alloc-
       SessionReservationSize parameter.  The old parameter is	supported  but
       will be eliminated in a future release.


     o BufferPoolSize <value>

       The  BufferPoolSize option was used to change the number of async write
       queue worker threads that were created to process  asynchronous	buffer
       cache writes.  This value is now always set to 4.

     o DirCacheSize <value>

       The DirCacheSize option was used to set the size of the client's direc-
       tory cache.  This option has been superseded by the buffercache.


     o DirFDCacheSize <value>

       The DirFDCacheSize option was used to set  the  size  of  the  client's
       directory file descriptor cache. This option has been superseded by the
       buffercache.


     o ForceStripeAlignment <Yes|No>

       The ForceStripeAlignment option was used to force the strict  alignment
       of the start of the volume to a stripe width boundary, and affected the
       way the file system was laid out at cvmkfs(1) time.   All  new  volumes
       are  now  created  with ForceStripeAlignment on, but older volumes that
       had ForceStripeAlignment off at create time will continue  to  function
       properly.

       NOTE:  If  cvmkfs(1)  is  run  on  a volume configuration file that has
       ForceStripeAlignment set, a  warning  will  be  displayed  because  the
       option has no effect.


     o IoHangLimitSecs <value>

       This  variable  defined the threshold for how long an I/O is determined
       to be 'hung' by the FSM program.  When the  FSM	program  detected  I/O
       hang  it  will  stop  execution in order to initiate failover to backup
       system.	This is now superseded by OpHangLimitSecs.


     o JournalICBufNum <value>

       The JournalICBufNum  option  defined  the  number  of  in-core  journal
       buffers to create.  This is now always set to 2.


     o JournalICBufSize <value>

       The  JournalICBufSize  option  defined  the size of the in-core Journal
       Buffer.	This is now always set to 32k


     o MaxMBPerClientReserve <value>

       The  MaxMBPerClientReserve  option   has   been	 superseded   by   the
       ReservedSpace option.

       The  MaxMBPerClientReserve  variable  defined  the  maximum  number  of
       megabytes the meta-data server should grant an Xsan client for  delayed
       allocation.  The default was 100.

       This  value  multiplied by MaxConnections - 1 was reserved by the meta-
       data server in each stripe group that can contain data.	This was  done
       so  that  clients  could  delay allocation and always be able to obtain
       space for data, even across meta-data server restarts.  This  delay  of
       allocation was only done on clients for buffer cache writes.

       A  value  of  0	turned	off delayed allocations, significantly reduced
       buffer cache performance on clients, and allowed nearly all of the disk
       space to be used.


     o MBufs <Yes|No>

       The  MBufs  option was used to set the number of message buffers in the
       FSM message queues.  This is now always set to 32.


     o MBufSize <value>

       The MBufSize option was used to set  the  maximum  size	of  a  message
       buffer.	This is now always set to 4k.


     o OpHangLimitSecs <value>

       This  variable  defines	the  threshold	(in seconds) for processing an
       individual operation by the FSM server daemon.  When the  threshold  is
       exceeded  the  FSM  server  daemon is aborted to initiate failover to a
       standby server.	Note, this is  typically  triggered  by  a  faulty  or
       underperforming	metadata  device causing FSM server operations to hang
       or execute very slow.  The default value is 180 seconds.  This variable
       can  be	adjusted  to  a higher value to avoid unnecessary failovers or
       reduced to a lower value to initiate a faster failover.	It can be  set
       to zero to completely disable monitoring.


     o ReadDirForcedVersion <Value>
       The  ReadDirForcedVersion enabled a modified directory search algorithm
       for older file systems.	This is no longer needed and is always off.

     o StaticInodes <Yes|No>

       The StaticInodes option was used to set the number  of  inodes  in  the
       volume at cvmkfs(1) time.  Inodes are always dynamically created now.


DISKTYPE SECTION
       Following is the format for a DiskType section:

	  [DiskType <name>]

	  Sectors <sectors_per_disk>

	  SectorSize <sector_size>


DISK SECTION
       The Disk section syntax is as follows:

	  [Disk <name>]

	  Status <UP | DOWN>

	  Type <disktype_name>


STRIPEGROUP SECTION
       The StripeGroup section format is as follows:

	  [StripeGroup <name>]

	  Status <UP | DOWN>

	  Exclusive <Yes | No>

	  Metadata <Yes | No>

	  Journal <Yes | No>

	  Affinity <eight_character_string>
	   [ Zero or more affinity entries are allowed ]

	  Read <Enabled | Disabled>

	  Write <Enabled | Disabled>

	  StripeBreadth <number_of_blocks_per_disk>

	  MultiPathMethod <Rotate|Static|Sticky|Balance|Cycle>

	  Node <disk_name> <stripe_group_unit_number>
	   [ One Node per disk in storage pool ]


     o Status
       If Up, the storage pool is available, if Down it is not.

     o StripeBreadth
       Describes  the  number of volume blocks or bytes that are appended to a
       file before switching to the next disk in the group.  When the value is
       specified without a multiplier suffix, it is a number of volume blocks.
       When specified with a multiplier, it is bytes.

     o Metadata
       If Yes, this storage pool contains metadata.  If No, it does not.

     o Journal
       If Yes, this storage pool contains the journal.	If No,	it  does  not.
       Only one storage pool may contain a journal per file system.

     o Exclusive
       When  the  Exclusive  variable is set to YES on a storage pool that has
       Metadata or Journal set to YES, no userdata may reside on that  storage
       pool.

       When  the  Exclusive variable is set to YES on a storage pool that does
       not have either Metadata or Journal set toe YES, and does have Affinity
       values  declared,  only the Affinities declared in its StripeGroup sec-
       tion are allowed to reside on this storage pool. This may be preferable
       for  high-bandwidth  applications.   Because  Exclusive	is used in two
       ways, a storage pool cannot have both exclusive	Affinity  declarations
       and metadata.

       The Exclusive helps to optimize disk striping strategies.  For example,
       in a broadcast video application, an  NTSC  field  is  blocked  out  at
       352,256	bytes per field. The optimal and required stripe breadth for a
       525 line (NTSC broadcast) storage pool is two fields (a frame), or  43,
       16k  volume  blocks.   However, a 625 line (PAL broadcast) storage pool
       uses 417,792 bytes per field, and the optimal stripe breadth is 51, 16k
       volume blocks per disk. In order for allocation to work in a mixed mode
       environment, it is necessary to have one storage pool set  up  for  525
       (NTSC)  and  another  set up for 625 (PAL).  See the configuration file
       example below to see two storage pools, each configured	optimally  for
       NTSC and PAL modes.

     o Affinity
       In conjunction with the Exclusive variable, the Affinity variable helps
       the FSM determine what type of allocation may occur on a storage  pool.
       When  Exclusive is YES, only files with matching Affinity values can be
       allocated.  When Exclusive is NO, it is possible that other file  types
       would  be  allocated  on  the storage pool. This could have fragmenting
       effects over time and eventually cause high-bandwidth performance prob-
       lems.   It  is  recommended that storage pools are developed to be spe-
       cialized for each file type used.

       The Affinity value can be any string of 8 characters or less.

     o Rtios
       The Rtios variable defines the maximum number of  disk  I/O  operations
       per  second  (IOs/s) available to real-time applications for the stripe
       group using the Quality of Service (QoS) API.  If both Rtios  and  Rtmb
       are  set  to  0 (the default value), QoS is disabled. If both Rtios and
       Rtmb are defined, the smaller value (after Rtmb is converted  to  IOs/s
       internally)  is used. This value should be obtained by real measurement
       using IO benchmark tool.

     o RtiosReserve
       The RtiosReserve variable defines the minimum number of disk I/O opera-
       tions  per  second reserved for non-realtime applications when realtime
       operations have been enabled using the QoS API. This prevents non-real-
       time  clients  from IO starvation. If both RtiosReserve and RtmbReserve
       are set to 0 (the default value),  the  actual  bandwidth  reserved  is
       1MB/s (converting to IO/s), at least 1 IO/s is reserved. If both param-
       eters are defined, the smaller value (RtmbReserve is converted to IOs/s
       internally)  is	used.  This  value should not be greater than Rtios or
       Rtmb (after being converted to IOs/s).

     o Rtmb
       The Rtmb variable defines the maximum number of MBs per	second	avail-
       able to real-time applications for the stripe group  using the QoS API.
       Internally the bandwidth is converted to IOs/s based on the size  of  a
       well-formed  I/Os,  i.e.  the size of a stripe width. If both Rtios and
       Rtmb are set to 0 (the default value), QoS is  disabled.  If  both  are
       defined,  the  smaller  value (RtmbReserve is converted to IOs/s inter-
       nally) is used. This value should be obtained through real  measurement
       using I/O benchmark tools. Note: since the system uses IOs/s internally
       to throttle I/Os, it is recommended to specify Rtmb only  if  all  I/Os
       are well formed. Otherwise, the conversion between MB/s and IOs/s using
       well-formed IOs could lead to unexpected results.

     o RtmbReserve
       The RtmbReserve variable defines the minimum number of MBs  per	second
       reserved  for  non-realtime  applications when realtime operations have
       been enabled using the QoS API. This prevents non-realtime clients from
       IO starvation. Internally this parameter is converted to IOs/s based on
       the size of a well-formed IO. If both RtiosReserve and RtmbReserve  are
       set  to	0  (the default value), the actual bandwidth reserved is 1MB/s
       (converting to IOs/s), at least 1 IO/s is reserved. If both  parameters
       are  defined,  the  smaller  value  (RtmbReserve  is converted to IOs/s
       internally) is used.  This value should not be greater than  the  value
       of Rtmb.

     o RtTokenTimeout
       The  RtTokenTimeout  variable defines the number of seconds for the FSM
       server to wait for clients to respond to a QoS  token  callback	before
       timeout.  If  this  parameter is not set or it is set to 0, the default
       value is 1.5 (seconds). This value may need to be  changed  for	a  SAN
       that has a mixture of client machine types (Linux, Windows, IRIX, etc.)
       that all have different TCP/IP characteristics. Also, large numbers  of
       clients (greater than 32) may also require increasing the value of this
       parameter.


EXAMPLE CONFIGURATION FILE
       The following is an example of a fairly complex Xsan volume  that  sup-
       ports  multiple broadcast video/audio file formats, seven storage pools
       and eighteen disk drives.This volume is set up to support both 525  and
       625 real-time broadcast formats.
