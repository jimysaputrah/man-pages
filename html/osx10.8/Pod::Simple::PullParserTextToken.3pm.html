NAME
       Pod::Simple::PullParserTextToken -- text-tokens from
       Pod::Simple::PullParser

SYNOPSIS
       (See Pod::Simple::PullParser)

DESCRIPTION
       When you do $parser->get_token on a Pod::Simple::PullParser, you might
       get an object of this class.

       This is a subclass of Pod::Simple::PullParserToken and inherits all its
       methods, and adds these methods:

       $token->text
	   This returns the text that this token holds.  For example, parsing
	   C<foo> will return a C start-token, a text-token, and a C end-
	   token.  And if you want to get the "foo" out of the text-token,
	   call "$token->text"

       $token->text(somestring)
	   This changes the string that this token holds.  You probably won't
	   need to do this.

       $token->text_r()
	   This returns a scalar reference to the string that this token
	   holds.  This can be useful if you don't want to memory-copy the
	   potentially large text value (well, as large as a paragraph or a
	   verbatim block) as calling $token->text would do.

	   Or, if you want to alter the value, you can even do things like
	   this:

	     for ( ${  $token->text_r  } ) {  # Aliases it with $_ !!

	       s/ The / the /g; # just for example

	       if( 'A' eq chr(65) ) {  # (if in an ASCII world)
		 tr/\xA0/ /;
		 tr/\xAD//d;
	       }

	       ...or however you want to alter the value...
	     }

       You're unlikely to ever need to construct an object of this class for
       yourself, but if you want to, call
       "Pod::Simple::PullParserTextToken->new( text )"
