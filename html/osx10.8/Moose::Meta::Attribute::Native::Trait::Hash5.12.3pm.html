NAME
       Moose::Meta::Attribute::Native::Trait::Hash - Helper trait for HashRef
       attributes

VERSION
       version 2.0205

SYNOPSIS
	 package Stuff;
	 use Moose;

	 has 'options' =&gt (
	     traits    =&gt ['Hash'],
	     is        =&gt 'ro',
	     isa       =&gt 'HashRef[Str]',
	     default   =&gt sub { {} },
	     handles   =&gt {
		 set_option	=&gt 'set',
		 get_option	=&gt 'get',
		 has_no_options =&gt 'is_empty',
		 num_options	=&gt 'count',
		 delete_option	=&gt 'delete',
		 option_pairs	=&gt 'kv',
	     },
	 );

DESCRIPTION
       This trait provides native delegation methods for hash references.

PROVIDED METHODS
       get($key, $key2, $key3...)
	   Returns values from the hash.

	   In list context it returns a list of values in the hash for the
	   given keys. In scalar context it returns the value for the last key
	   specified.

	   This method requires at least one argument.

       set($key =&gt $value, $key2 =&gt $value2...)
	   Sets the elements in the hash to the given values. It returns the
	   new values set for each key, in the same order as the keys passed
	   to the method.

	   This method requires at least two arguments, and expects an even
	   number of arguments.

       delete($key, $key2, $key3...)
	   Removes the elements with the given keys.

	   In list context it returns a list of values in the hash for the
	   deleted keys. In scalar context it returns the value for the last
	   key specified.

       keys
	   Returns the list of keys in the hash.

	   This method does not accept any arguments.

       exists($key)
	   Returns true if the given key is present in the hash.

	   This method requires a single argument.

       defined($key)
	   Returns true if the value of a given key is defined.

	   This method requires a single argument.

       values
	   Returns the list of values in the hash.

	   This method does not accept any arguments.

       kv  Returns the key/value pairs in the hash as an array of array
	   references.

	     for my $pair ( $object-&gtoptions-&gtkv ) {
		 print "$pair-&gt[0] = $pair-&gt[1]\n";
	     }

	   This method does not accept any arguments.

       elements
	   Returns the key/value pairs in the hash as a flattened list..

	   This method does not accept any arguments.

       clear
	   Resets the hash to an empty value, like "%hash = ()".

	   This method does not accept any arguments.

       count
	   Returns the number of elements in the hash. Also useful for not
	   empty: "has_options =&gt 'count'".

	   This method does not accept any arguments.

       is_empty
	   If the hash is populated, returns false. Otherwise, returns true.

	   This method does not accept any arguments.

       accessor($key)
       accessor($key, $value)
	   If passed one argument, returns the value of the specified key. If
	   passed two arguments, sets the value of the specified key.

	   When called as a setter, this method returns the value that was
	   set.

       shallow_clone
	   This method returns a shallow clone of the hash reference.  The
	   return value is a reference to a new hash with the same keys and
	   values.  It is shallow because any values that were references in
	   the original will be the same references in the clone.

       Note that "each" is deliberately omitted, due to its stateful
       interaction with the hash iterator. "keys" or "kv" are much safer.

METHODS
       meta
