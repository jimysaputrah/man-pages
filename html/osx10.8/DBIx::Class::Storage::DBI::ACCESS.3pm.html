NAME
       DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::ACCESS - Support specific to MS Access

DESCRIPTION
       This is the base class for Microsoft Access support.

       This driver supports last_insert_id, empty inserts for tables with
       "AUTOINCREMENT" columns, nested transactions via auto_savepoint, "GUID"
       columns via DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::UniqueIdentifier.

SUPPORTED VERSIONS
       This module has currently only been tested on MS Access 2010.

       Information about how well it works on different version of MS Access
       is welcome (write the mailing list, or submit a ticket to RT if you
       find bugs.)

USING GUID COLUMNS
       If you have "GUID" PKs or other "GUID" columns with auto_nextval you
       will need to set a new_guid callback, like so:

	 $schema->storage->new_guid(sub { Data::GUID->new->as_string });

       Under Catalyst you can use code similar to this in your
       Catalyst::Model::DBIC::Schema "Model.pm":

	 after BUILD => sub {
	   my $self = shift;
	   $self->storage->new_guid(sub { Data::GUID->new->as_string });
	 };
