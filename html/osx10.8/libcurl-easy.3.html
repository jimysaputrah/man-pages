NAME
       libcurl-easy - easy interface overview

DESCRIPTION
       When  using  libcurl's "easy" interface you init your session and get a
       handle (often referred to as an "easy handle"), which you use as  input
       to  the	easy interface functions you use. Use curl_easy_init(3) to get
       the handle.

       You continue by setting all the options you want in the upcoming trans-
       fer,  the most important among them is the URL itself (you can't trans-
       fer anything without a specified URL as you may have figured out  your-
       self). You might want to set some callbacks as well that will be called
       from the library when data is  available  etc.  curl_easy_setopt(3)  is
       used for all this.

       When  all  is  setup,  you  tell  libcurl to perform the transfer using
       curl_easy_perform(3).  It will then do the entire operation  and  won't
       return until it is done (successfully or not).

       After  the  transfer  has  been	made, you can set new options and make
       another transfer, or if you're done, cleanup  the  session  by  calling
       curl_easy_cleanup(3).  If  you  want  persistent connections, you don't
       cleanup immediately, but instead run ahead and perform other  transfers
       using the same easy handle.
