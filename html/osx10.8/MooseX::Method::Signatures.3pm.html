NAME
       MooseX::Method::Signatures - Method declarations with type constraints
       and no source filter

SYNOPSIS
	   package Foo;

	   use Moose;
	   use MooseX::Method::Signatures;

	   method morning (Str $name) {
	       $self-&gtsay("Good morning ${name}!");
	   }

	   method hello (Str :$who, Int :$age where { $_ &gt 0 }) {
	       $self-&gtsay("Hello ${who}, I am ${age} years old!");
	   }

	   method greet (Str $name, Bool :$excited = 0) {
	       if ($excited) {
		   $self-&gtsay("GREETINGS ${name}!");
	       }
	       else {
		   $self-&gtsay("Hi ${name}!");
	       }
	   }

	   $foo-&gtmorning('Resi');			   # This works.

	   $foo-&gthello(who =&gt 'world', age =&gt 42);	   # This too.

	   $foo-&gtgreet('Resi', excited =&gt 1);		   # And this as well.

	   $foo-&gthello(who =&gt 'world', age =&gt 'fortytwo'); # This doesn't.

	   $foo-&gthello(who =&gt 'world', age =&gt -23);	   # This neither.

	   $foo-&gtmorning;				   # Won't work.

	   $foo-&gtgreet; 				   # Will fail.

DESCRIPTION
       Provides a proper method keyword, like "sub" but specifically for
       making methods and validating their arguments against Moose type
       constraints.

SIGNATURE SYNTAX
       The signature syntax is heavily based on Perl 6. However not the full
       Perl 6 signature syntax is supported yet and some of it never will be.

   Type Constraints
	   method foo ( 	    $affe) # no type checking
	   method bar (Animal	    $affe) # $affe-&gtisa('Animal')
	   method baz (Animal|Human $affe) # $affe-&gtisa('Animal') || $affe-&gtisa('Human')

   Positional vs. Named
	   method foo ( $a,  $b,  $c) # positional
	   method bar (:$a, :$b, :$c) # named
	   method baz ( $a,  $b, :$c) # combined

   Required vs. Optional
	   method foo ($a , $b!, :$c!, :$d!) # required
	   method bar ($a?, $b?, :$c , :$d?) # optional

   Defaults
	   method foo ($a = 42) # defaults to 42

   Constraints
	   method foo ($foo where { $_ % 2 == 0 }) # only even

   Invocant
	   method foo (        $moo) # invocant is called $self and is required
	   method bar ($self:  $moo) # same, but explicit
	   method baz ($class: $moo) # invocant is called $class

   Labels
	   method foo (:     $affe ) # called as $obj-&gtfoo(affe =&gt $value)
	   method bar (:apan($affe)) # called as $obj-&gtfoo(apan =&gt $value)

   Traits
	   method foo (Affe $bar does trait)
	   method foo (Affe $bar is trait)

       The only currently supported trait is "coerce", which will attempt to
       coerce the value provided if it doesn't satisfy the requirements of the
       type constraint.

   Placeholders
	   method foo ($bar, $, $baz)

       Sometimes you don't care about some params you're being called with.
       Just put the bare sigil instead of a full variable name into the
       signature to avoid an extra lexical variable to be created.

   Complex Example
	   method foo ( SomeClass $thing where { $_-&gtcan('stuff') }:
			Str  $bar  = "apan",
			Int :$baz! = 42 where { $_ % 2 == 0 } where { $_ &gt 10 } )

	   # the invocant is called $thing, must be an instance of SomeClass and
		  has to implement a 'stuff' method
	   # $bar is positional, required, must be a string and defaults to "apan"
	   # $baz is named, required, must be an integer, defaults to 42 and needs
	   #	  to be even and greater than 10

BUGS, CAVEATS AND NOTES
       This module is as stable now, but this is not to say that it is
       entirely bug free. If you notice any odd behaviour (messages not being
       as good as they could for example) then please raise a bug.

   Fancy signatures
       Parse::Method::Signatures is used to parse the signatures. However,
       some signatures that can be parsed by it aren't supported by this
       module (yet).

   No source filter
       While this module does rely on the hairy black magic of Devel::Declare
       it does not depend on a source filter. As such, it doesn't try to parse
       and rewrite your source code and there should be no weird side effects.

       Devel::Declare only effects compilation. After that, it's a normal
       subroutine.  As such, for all that hairy magic, this module is
       surprisingly stable.

   What about regular subroutines?
       Devel::Declare cannot yet change the way "sub" behaves. However, the
       signatures module can. Right now it only provides very basic
       signatures, but it's extendable enough that plugging
       MooseX::Method::Signatures signatures into that should be quite
       possible.

   What about the return value?
       Type constraints for return values can be declared using

	 method foo (Int $x, Str $y) returns (Bool) { ... }

       however, this feature only works with scalar return values and is still
       considered to be experimental.

   Interaction with Moose::Role
       Methods not seen by a role's "requires"

       Because the processing of the MooseX::Method::Signatures "method" and
       the Moose "with" keywords are both done at runtime, it can happen that
       a role will require a method before it is declared (which will cause
       Moose to complain very loudly and abort the program).

       For example, the following will not work:

	   # in file Canine.pm

	   package Canine;

	   use Moose;
	   use MooseX::Method::Signatures;

	   with 'Watchdog';

	   method bark { print "Woof!\n"; }

	   1;


	   # in file Watchdog.pm

	   package Watchdog;

	   use Moose::Role;

	   requires 'bark';  # will assert! evaluated before 'method' is processed

	   sub warn_intruder {
	       my $self = shift;
	       my $intruder = shift;

	       $self-&gtbark until $intruder-&gtgone;
	   }

	   1;

       A workaround for this problem is to use "with" only after the methods
       have been defined.  To take our previous example, Canine could be
       reworked thus:

	   package Canine;

	   use Moose;
	   use MooseX::Method::Signatures;

	   method bark { print "Woof!\n"; }

	   with 'Watchdog';

	   1;

       A better solution is to use MooseX::Declare instead of plain
       MooseX::Method::Signatures. It defers application of roles until the
       end of the class definition. With it, our example would becomes:

	   # in file Canine.pm

	   use MooseX::Declare;

	   class Canine with Watchdog {
	       method bark { print "Woof!\n"; }
	   }

	   1;

	   # in file Watchdog.pm

	   use MooseX::Declare;

	   role Watchdog {
	       requires 'bark';

	       method warn_intruder ( $intruder ) {
		   $self-&gtbark until $intruder-&gtgone;
	       }
	   }

	   1;

       Subroutine redefined warnings

       When composing a Moose::Role into a class that uses
       MooseX::Method::Signatures, you may get a "Subroutine redefined"
       warning. This happens when both the role and the class define a
       method/subroutine of the same name. (The way roles work, the one
       defined in the class takes precedence.) To eliminate this warning, make
       sure that your "with" declaration happens after any method/subroutine
       declarations that may have the same name as a method/subroutine within
       a role.
