NAME
       Package::Stash::PP - pure perl implementation of the Package::Stash API

VERSION
       version 0.33

SYNOPSIS
	 use Package::Stash;

DESCRIPTION
       This is a backend for Package::Stash implemented in pure perl, for
       those without a compiler or who would like to use this inline in
       scripts.

BUGS
       o   remove_symbol also replaces the associated typeglob

	   This can cause unexpected behavior when doing manipulation at
	   compile time - removing subroutines will still allow them to be
	   called from within the package as subroutines (although they will
	   not be available as methods). This can be considered a feature in
	   some cases (this is how namespace::clean works, for instance), but
	   should not be relied upon - use "remove_glob" directly if you want
	   this behavior.

       o   Some minor memory leaks

	   The pure perl implementation has a couple minor memory leaks (see
	   the TODO tests in t/20-leaks.t) that I'm having a hard time
	   tracking down - these may be core perl bugs, it's hard to tell.
