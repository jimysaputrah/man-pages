       the Tcl event queue

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lttk.h&gt

       Tk_CollapseMotionEvents(display, collapse)

       Tk_QueueWindowEvent(eventPtr, position)

ARGUMENTS
       Display *display (in)			Display for which  to  control
						motion event collapsing.

       int collapse (in)			Indicates    whether	motion
						events should be collapsed  or
						not.

       XEvent *eventPtr (in)			An  event  to add to the event

						structure be set to zero.

       Tcl_QueuePosition position (in)		Where to add the new event  in

DESCRIPTION
       Tk_QueueWindowEvent places a window event on Tcl's internal event queue
       for eventual servicing.	It creates a Tcl_Event structure,  copies  the
       event into that structure, and calls Tcl_QueueEvent to add the event to
       the queue.  When the event is eventually removed from the queue	it  is
       processed just like all window events.

       When  multiple  motion events are received for the same window in rapid
       succession, they are collapsed by default.  This behavior can  be  con-
       trolled	with  Tk_CollapseMotionEvents.	Tk_CollapseMotionEvents always
       returns the previous value for collapse behavior on the display.

       The position argument to Tk_QueueWindowEvent has the same  significance
       as  for	Tcl_QueueEvent;   see the documentation for Tcl_QueueEvent for
       details.
