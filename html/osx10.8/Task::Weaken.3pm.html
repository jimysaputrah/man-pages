NAME
       Task::Weaken - Ensure that a platform has weaken support

DESCRIPTION
       One recurring problem in modules that use Scalar::Util's "weaken"
       function is that it is not present in the pure-perl variant.

       While this isn't necesarily always a problem in a straight CPAN-based
       Perl environment, some operating system distributions only include the
       pure-Perl versions, don't include the XS version, and so weaken is then
       "missing" from the platform, despite passing a dependency on
       Scalar::Util successfully.

       Most notably this is RedHat Linux at time of writing, but other come
       and go and do the same thing, hence "recurring problem".

       The normal solution is to manually write tests in each distribution to
       ensure that "weaken" is available.

       This restores the functionality testing to a dependency you do once in
       your Makefile.PL, rather than something you have to write extra tests
       for each time you write a module.

       It should also help make the package auto-generators for the various
       operating systems play more nicely, because it introduces a dependency
       that they have to have a proper weaken in order to work.

   How this Task works
       Part of the problem seems to stem from the fact that some distributions
       continue to include modules even if they fail some of their tests.

       To get around that for this module, it will do a few dirty tricks.

       If Scalar::Util is not available at all, it will issue a normal
       dependency on the module. However, if Scalar::Util is relatively new (
       it is &gt= 1.19 ) and the module does not have weaken, the install will
       bail out altogether with a long error encouraging the user to seek
       support from their vendor (this problem happens most often in vendor-
       packaged Perl versions).

       This distribution also contains tests to ensure that weaken is
       available using more normal methods.

       So if your module uses "weaken", you can just add the following to your
       Module::Install-based Makefile.PL (or equivalent).

	 requires 'Task::Weaken' =&gt 0;
