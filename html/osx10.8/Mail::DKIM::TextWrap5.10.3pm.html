NAME
       Mail::DKIM::TextWrap - text wrapping module written for use with DKIM

SYNOPSIS (FOR MAIL::DKIM USERS)
	 use Mail::DKIM::TextWrap;

       Just add the above line to any program that uses Mail::DKIM::Signer and
       your signatures will automatically be wrapped to 72 characters.

SYNOPSIS (FOR OTHER USERS)
	 my $output = "";
	 my $tw = Mail::DKIM::TextWrap->new(
			 Margin => 10,
			 Output => \$output,
		     );
	 $tw->add("Mary had a little lamb, whose fleece was white as snow.\n");
	 $tw->finish;

	 print $output;

DESCRIPTION
       This is a general-purpose text-wrapping module that I wrote because I
       had some specific needs with Mail::DKIM that none of the contemporary
       text-wrapping modules offered.

       Specifically, it offers the ability to change wrapping options in the
       middle of a paragraph. For instance, with a DKIM signature:

	 DKIM-Signature: a=rsa; c=simple; h=first:second:third:fourth;
		 b=Xr2mo2wmb1LZBwmEJElIPezal7wQQkRQ8WZtxpofkNmXTjXf8y2f0

       the line-breaks can be inserted next to any of the colons of the h=
       tag, or any character of the b= tag. The way I implemented this was to
       serialize the signature one element at a time, changing the text-
       wrapping options at the start and end of each tag.

TEXT WRAPPING OPTIONS
       Text wrapping options can be specified when calling new(), or by simply
       changing the property as needed. For example, to change the number of
       characters allowed per line:

	 $tw->{Margin} = 20;

       Break
	   a regular expression matching characters where a line break can be
	   inserted. Line breaks are inserted AFTER a matching substring.  The
	   default is "/\s/".

       BreakBefore
	   a regular expression matching characters where a line break can be
	   inserted. Line breaks are inserted BEFORE a matching substring.
	   Usually, you want to use Break, rather than BreakBefore.  The
	   default is "undef".

       Margin
	   specifies how many characters to allow per line.  The default is
	   72. If no place to line-break is found on a line, the line will
	   extend beyond this margin.

       Separator
	   the text to insert when a linebreak is needed.  The default is
	   "\n". If you want to set a following-line indent (e.g. all lines
	   but the first begin with four spaces), use something like "\n    ".

       Swallow
	   a regular expression matching characters that can be omitted when a
	   line break occurs. For example, if you insert a line break between
	   two words, then you are replacing a "space" with the line break, so
	   you are omitting the space. On the other hand, if you insert a line
	   break between two parts of a hyphenated word, then you are breaking
	   at the hyphen, but you still want to display the hyphen.  The
	   default is "/\s/".

CONSTRUCTOR
   new() - create a new text-wrapping object
	 my $tw = Mail::DKIM::TextWrap->new(
			     Output => \$output,
			     %wrapping_options,
			 );

       The text-wrapping object encapsulates the current options and the
       current state of the text stream. In addition to specifying text
       wrapping options as described in the section above, the following
       options are recognized:

       Output
	   a scalar reference, or a glob reference, to specify where the
	   "wrapped" text gets output to. If not specified, the default of
	   STDOUT is used.

METHODS
   add() - process some text that can be wrapped
	 $tw->add("Mary had a little lamb.\n");

       You can add() all the text at once, or add() the text in parts by
       calling add() multiple times.

   finish() - call when no more text is to be added
	 $tw->finish;

       Call this when finished adding text, so that any remaining text in
       TextWrap's buffers will be output.

   flush() - output the current partial word, if any
	 $tw->flush;

       Call this whenever changing TextWrap's parameters in the middle of a
       string of words. It explicitly allows a line-break at the current
       position in the string, regardless of whether it matches the current
       break pattern.
