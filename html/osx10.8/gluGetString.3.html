NAME
       gluGetString - return a string describing the GLU version or GLU exten-
       sions


C SPECIFICATION
       const GLubyte * gluGetString( GLenum name )


PARAMETERS
       name  Specifies	a  symbolic   constant,   one	of   GLU_VERSION,   or
	     GLU_EXTENSIONS.

DESCRIPTION
       gluGetString  returns  a  pointer to a static string describing the GLU
       version or the GLU extensions that are supported.

       The version number is one of the following forms:

       major_number.minor_number
       major_number.minor_number.release_number.

       The version string is of the following form:

       version number&ltspace&gtvendor-specific information

       Vendor-specific information  is	optional.   Its  format  and  contents
       depend on the implementation.

       The standard GLU contains a basic set of features and capabilities.  If
       a company or group of companies wish to support other  features,  these
       may  be	included as extensions to the GLU.  If name is GLU_EXTENSIONS,
       then gluGetString returns a space-separated list of names of  supported
       GLU extensions.	(Extension names never contain spaces.)

       All strings are null-terminated.

NOTES
       gluGetString only returns information about GLU extensions. Call glGet-
       String to get a list of GL extensions.

       gluGetString is an initialization routine. Calling it after a glNewList
       results in undefined behavior.

ERRORS
       NULL is returned if name is not GLU_VERSION or GLU_EXTENSIONS.
