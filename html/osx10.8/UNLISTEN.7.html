UNLISTEN(7)		PostgreSQL 9.1.4 Documentation		   UNLISTEN(7)



NAME
       UNLISTEN - stop listening for a notification

SYNOPSIS
       UNLISTEN { channel | * }

DESCRIPTION
       UNLISTEN is used to remove an existing registration for NOTIFY events.
       UNLISTEN cancels any existing registration of the current PostgreSQL
       session as a listener on the notification channel named channel. The
       special wildcard * cancels all listener registrations for the current
       session.


       NOTIFY(7) contains a more extensive discussion of the use of LISTEN and
       NOTIFY.

PARAMETERS
       channel
	   Name of a notification channel (any identifier).

       *
	   All current listen registrations for this session are cleared.

NOTES
       You can unlisten something you were not listening for; no warning or
       error will appear.

       At the end of each session, UNLISTEN * is automatically executed.

       A transaction that has executed UNLISTEN cannot be prepared for
       two-phase commit.

EXAMPLES
       To make a registration:

	   LISTEN virtual;
	   NOTIFY virtual;
	   Asynchronous notification "virtual" received from server process with PID 8448.

       Once UNLISTEN has been executed, further NOTIFY messages will be
       ignored:

	   UNLISTEN virtual;
	   NOTIFY virtual;
	   -- no NOTIFY event is received

COMPATIBILITY
       There is no UNLISTEN command in the SQL standard.

SEE ALSO
       LISTEN(7), NOTIFY(7)
