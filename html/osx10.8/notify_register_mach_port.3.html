DESCRIPTION
     These routines allow processes to exchange stateless notification events.
     Processes post notifications to a single system-wide notification server,
     which then distributes notifications to client processes that have regis-
     tered to receive those notifications, including processes run by other
     users.

     Notifications are associated with names in a namespace shared by all
     clients of the system.  Clients may post notifications for names, and may
     monitor names for posted notifications.  Clients may request notification
     delivery by a number of different methods.

     Clients desiring to monitor names in the notification system must regis-
     ter with the system, providing a name and other information required for
     the desired notification delivery method.	Clients are given an integer
     token representing the registration.

     The kernel provides limited queues for mach message and file descriptor
     messages.	It is important to make sure that clients read mach ports and
     file descriptors frequently to prevent messages from being lost due to
     resource limitations.  Clients that use signal-based notification should
     be aware that signals are not delivered to a process while it is running
     in a signal handler.  This may affect the delivery of signals in close
     succession.

     Notifications may be coalesced in some cases.  Multiple events posted for
     a name in rapid succession may result in a single notification sent to
     clients registered for notification for that name.  Clients checking for
     changes using the notify_check() routine cannot determine if more than
     one event has been posted since a previous call to notify_check() for
     that name.

     "False positives" may occur in notify_check() when used with a token gen-
     erated by notify_register_check() due to implementation constraints.
     This behavior may vary in future releases.

   notify_post
     This routine causes the system to send a notification for the given name
     to all clients that have registered for notifications of this name.  This
     is the only API required for an appication that only produces notifica-
     tions.

   notify_register_check
     Registers for passive notification for the given name.  The routine gen-
     erates a token that may be used with the notify_check() routine to check
     if any notifications have been posted for the name.  The check is imple-
     mented using a shared memory scheme, making the check very fast and effi-
     cient.  The implementation has a limited amount of shared memory, so
     developers are encouraged to use this mechanism sparingly.  It is also
     important to release the resources consumed by a registration with
     notify_cancel() when they are no longer required by the application.

   notify_register_dispatch
     registers a callback handler in the form of a block which will be dis-
     patched to the queue when a notification for the given name is received.
     This is a convenient way to register callbacks without any management of
     file descriptors, mach ports, or signals on the part of the application.
     The given queue is retained by the system for the lifetime of the notifi-
     cation.  Use notify_cancel() to release the notification and its refer-
     ence to the queue.

   notify_register_signal
     registers a client for notification delivery via a signal.  This fits
     well with the design of many UNIX daemons that use a signal such as
     SIGHUP to reinitialize of reset internal state information.  Clients may
     use the registration token generated by this routine to check for notifi-
     cations using notify_check().  This allows the application to determine
     if a signal was received as the result of a notification, or if the sig-
     nal was generated by some other source.  It also permits the application
     that registers for signal notification for multiple names to determine
     which name was associated with the notification.

   notify_register_mach_port
     registers a client for notification delivery via mach messaging.  Notifi-
     cations are delivered by an empty message sent to a mach port.  By
     default, a new port is created by a call to this routine.	A mach port
     previously created by a call to this routine may be used for notifica-
     tions if a pointer to that port is passed in to the routine and
     NOTIFY_REUSE is set in the flags parameter.  The notification service
     must be able to extract send rights to the port.

     Note that the kernel limits the size of the message queue for any port.
     If it is important that notifications should not be lost due to queue
     overflow, clients should service messages quickly, and be cautious in
     using the same port for notifications for more than one name.

     A notification message has an empty message body.	The msgh_id field in
     the mach message header will have the value of the notification token.
     If a port is reused for multiple notification registrations, the msgh_id
     value may be used to determine which name generated the notification.

   notify_register_file_descriptor
     Register for notification by a write to a file descriptor.

     By default, a new file descriptor is created and a pointer to it is
     returned as the value of the "notify_fd" parameter.  A file descriptor
     created by a previous call to this routine may be used for notifications
     if a pointer to that file descriptor is passed in to the routine and
     NOTIFY_REUSE is set in the flags parameter.

     Note that the kernel limits the buffer space for queued writes on a file
     descriptor.  If it is important that notifications should not be lost due
     to queue overflow, clients should service messages quickly, and be cau-
     tious in using the same file descriptor for notifications for more than
     one name.

     Notifications are delivered by an integer value written to the file
     descriptor.  The value is sent in network byte order.  When converted to
     host byte order, for example by using ntohl(), it will match the notifi-
     cation token for which the notification was generated.

   notify_check
     Checks if any notifications have been posted for a name.  The output
     parameter "check" is set to 0 for false, 1 for true.  A true indication
     is returned the first time notify_check is called for a token.  Subse-
     quent calls give a true indication when notifications have been posted
     for the name associated with the notification token.

     notify_check() may be used with any notification token produced by any of
     the notification registration routines.  A fast check based on a shared
     memory implementation is used when the token was generated by
     notify_register_check().  Other tokens are checked by a call to the noti-
     fication server.

   notify_set_state
     Set a 64-bit unsigned integer variable associated with a token.

     Each registered notification key has an associated 64-bit integer vari-
     able, which may be set using this routine and examined using the
     notify_get_state() routine.  The state variable is free to be used by
     clients of the notification API.  It may be used to synchronize state
     information between cooperating processes or threads.  (Available in Mac
     OS X 10.5 or later.)

   notify_get_state
     Get the 64-bit unsigned integer value associated with a token.  The
     default value of a state variable is zero.  (Available in Mac OS X 10.5
     or later.)

   notify_suspend
     Suspends delivery of notifications for a notification token.  Any notifi-
     cations corresponding to a token that are posted while it is suspended
     will be coalesced, and pended until notifications are resumed using
     notify_resume().

     Calls to notify_suspend() may be nested.  Notifications will resume only
     when a matching number of calls are made to notify_resume().

   notify_resume
     Removes one level of suspension for a token previously suspended by a
     call to notify_suspend().	When resumed, notifications will be delivered
     normally.	A single notification will be generated if any notifications
     were pended while the token was suspended.

   notify_cancel
     Cancel notification and free resources associated with a notification
     token.  Mach ports and file descriptor associated with a token are
     released (deallocated or closed) when all registration tokens associated
     with the port or file descriptor have been cancelled.

NAMESPACE CONVENTIONS
     Names in the namespace must be NULL-terminated.  Names should be encoded
     as UTF-8 strings.

     The namespace supported by the system is unstructured, but users of this
     API are highly encouraged to follow the reverse-ICANN domain name conven-
     tion used for Java package names and for System Preferences on Mac OS X.
     For example, "com.mydomain.example.event".

     Apple Computer reserves the portion of the namespace prefixed by
     "com.apple.".  This policy is not enforced in the current implementation,
     but may be in the future.

     Names in the space "user.uid.UID", where UID is a numeric user ID number
     are reserved for processes with that UID.	Names in this protected space
     may only be accessed or modified by processes with the effective UID
     specified as the UID in the name.	The name "user.uid.UID" is protected
     for the given UID, as are any names of the form "user.uid.UID.<sub-
     path>".  In the latter case, the name must have a dot character following
     the UID.

     Third party developers are encouraged to choose a prefix for names that
     will avoid conflicts in the shared namespace.

     The portion of the namespece prefixed by the string "self." is set aside
     for private use by applications.  That is, each client may use that part
     of the namespace for intra-process notifications.	These notifications
     are private to each individual process and are not propagated between
     processes.
