NAME
       Net::LDAP::Control::ProxyAuth - LDAPv3 Proxy Authentication control
       object

SYNOPSIS
	use Net::LDAP;
	use Net::LDAP::Control::ProxyAuth;

	$ldap = Net::LDAP-&gtnew( "ldap.mydomain.eg" );

	$auth = Net::LDAP::Control::ProxyAuth-&gtnew( authzID =&gt 'dn:cn=me,ou=people,o=myorg.com' );

	@args = ( base	   =&gt "cn=subnets,cn=sites,cn=configuration,$BASE_DN",
		  scope    =&gt "subtree",
		  filter   =&gt "(objectClass=subnet)",
		  callback =&gt \&process_entry, # Call this sub for each entry
		  control  =&gt [ $auth ],
	);

	while(1) {
	  # Perform search
	  my $mesg = $ldap-&gtsearch( @args );

	  # Only continue on LDAP_SUCCESS
	  $mesg-&gtcode and last;

	}

DESCRIPTION
       "Net::LDAP::Control::ProxyAuth" provides an interface for the creation
       and manipulation of objects that represent the
       "proxyauthorisationControl" as described by
       draft-weltman-ldapv3-proxy-XX.txt.

CONSTRUCTOR ARGUMENTS
       In addition to the constructor arguments described in
       Net::LDAP::Control the following are provided.

       authzID
	   The authzID that is required. This is the identity we are
	   requesting operations to use

       proxyDN
	   In older versions of draft-weltman-ldapv3-proxy-XX.txt the value in
	   the control and thus the constructor argument was a DN and was
	   called "proxyDN". It served the same purpose as "authzID" in recent
	   versions of "proxyauthorisationControl".

       Please note: Unfortunately the OID and the encoding or the
       "proxyauthorisationControl" changed significantly in recent versions of
       draft-weltman-ldapv3-proxy-XX.txt.  Net::LDAP::Control::ProxyAuth tries
       to cope with that situation and changes the OID and encoding used
       depending on the constructor argument.

       With "proxyDN" as constructor argument the old OID and encoding are
       used, while with "authzID" as constructor argument the new OID and
       encoding are used.  Using this logic servers supporting either OID can
       be handled correctly.

METHODS
       As with Net::LDAP::Control each constructor argument described above is
       also available as a method on the object which will return the current
       value for the attribute if called without an argument, and set a new
       value for the attribute if called with an argument.
