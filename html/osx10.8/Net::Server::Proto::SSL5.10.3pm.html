NAME
	 Net::Server::Proto::SSL - Net::Server SSL protocol.

SYNOPSIS
       See Net::Server::Proto.

DESCRIPTION
       Experimental.  If anybody has any successes or ideas for improvment
       under SSL, please email &ltpaul@seamons.com&gt.

       Protocol module for Net::Server.  This module implements a secure
       socket layer over tcp (also known as SSL).  See Net::Server::Proto.

       There is a limit inherent from using IO::Socket::SSL, namely that only
       one SSL connection can be maintained by Net::Server.  However,
       Net::Server should also be able to maintain any number of TCP, UDP, or
       UNIX connections in addition to the one SSL connection.

       Additionally, getline support is very limited and writing directly to
       STDOUT will not work.  This is entirely dependent upon the
       implementation of IO::Socket::SSL.  getline may work but the client is
       not copied to STDOUT under SSL.	It is suggested that clients sysread
       and syswrite to the client handle (located in $self-&gt{server}-&gt{client}
       or passed to the process_request subroutine as the first argument).

PARAMETERS
       In addition to the normal Net::Server parameters, any of the SSL
       parameters from IO::Socket::SSL may also be specified.  See
       IO::Socket::SSL for information on setting this up.

BUGS
       Christopher A Bongaarts pointed out that if the SSL negotiation is slow
       then the server won't be accepting for that period of time (because the
       locking of accept is around both the socket accept and the SSL
       negotiation).  This means that as it stands now the SSL implementation
       is susceptible to DOS attacks.  To fix this will require deviding up
       the accept call a little bit more finely which may not yet be possible
       with IO::Socket::SSL.  Any ideas or patches on this bug are welcome.

LICENCE
       Distributed under the same terms as Net::Server

THANKS
       Thanks to Vadim for pointing out the IO::Socket::SSL accept was
       returning objects blessed into the wrong class.
