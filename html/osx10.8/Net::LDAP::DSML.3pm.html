NAME
       NET::LDAP::DSML -- A DSML Writer for Net::LDAP

SYNOPSIS
	For a directory entry;

	use Net::LDAP;
	use Net::LDAP::DSML;
	use IO::File;


	my $server = "localhost";
	my $file = "testdsml.xml";
	my $ldap = Net::LDAP-&gtnew($server);

	$ldap-&gtbind();


	#
	# For file i/o
	#
	my $file = "testdsml.xml";

	my $io = IO::File-&gtnew($file,"w") or die ("failed to open $file as filehandle.$!\n");

	my $dsml = Net::LDAP::DSML-&gtnew(output =&gt $io, pretty_print =&gt 1 )
	     or die ("DSML object creation problem using an output file.\n");
	#      OR
	#
	# For file i/o
	#

	open (IO,"&gt$file") or die("failed to open $file.$!");

	my $dsml = Net::LDAP::DSML-&gtnew(output =&gt *IO, pretty_print =&gt 1)
	    or die ("DSML object creation problem using an output file.\n");

	#      OR
	#
	# For array usage.
	# Pass a reference to an array.
	#

	my @data = ();
	$dsml = Net::LDAP::DSML-&gtnew(output =&gt \@data, pretty_print =&gt 1)
	    or die ("DSML object cration problem using an output array.\n");


	 my $mesg = $ldap-&gtsearch(
				  base	   =&gt 'o=airius.com',
				  scope    =&gt 'sub',
				  filter   =&gt 'ou=accounting',
				  callback =&gt sub {
						my ($mesg,$entry) =@_;
						$dsml-&gtwrite_entry($entry)
						 if (ref $entry eq 'Net::LDAP::Entry');
					      }
				   );

	die ("search failed with ",$mesg-&gtcode(),"\n") if $mesg-&gtcode();

	For directory schema;

	A file or array can be used for output, in the following example
	only an array will be used.

	my $schema = $ldap-&gtschema();
	my @data = ();
	my $dsml = Net::LDAP::DSML-&gtnew(output =&gt \@data, pretty_print =&gt 1 )
	     or die ("DSML object creation problem using an output array.\n");

	$dsml-&gtwrite_schema($schema);

	print "Finished printing DSML\n";

DESCRIPTION
       Directory Service Markup Language (DSML) is the XML standard for
       representing directory service information in XML.

       At the moment this module only writes DSML entry and schema entities.
       Reading DSML entities is a future project.

       Eventually this module will be a full level 2 consumer and producer
       enabling you to give you full DSML conformance.	Currently this module
       has the ability to be a level 2 producer.  The user must understand the
       his/her directory server will determine the consumer and producer level
       they can achieve.

       To determine conformance, it is useful to divide DSML documents into
       four types:

	 1.Documents containing no directory schema nor any references to
	   an external schema.
	 2.Documents containing no directory schema but containing at
	   least one reference to an external schema.
	 3.Documents containing only a directory schema.
	 4.Documents containing both a directory schema and entries.

       A producer of DSML must be able to produce documents of type 1.	A
       producer of DSML may, in addition, be able to produce documents of
       types 2 thru 4.

       A producer that can produce documents of type 1 is said to be a level 1
       producer. A producer than can produce documents of all four types is
       said to be a level 2 producer.

CALLBACKS
       The module uses callbacks to improve performance (at least the
       appearance of improving performance ;) and to reduce the amount of
       memory required to parse large DSML files. Every time a single entry or
       schema is processed we pass the Net::LDAP object (either an Entry or
       Schema object) to the callback routine.

CONSTRUCTOR
       new ()
	   Creates a new Net::LDAP::DSML object.  There are 2 options to this
	   method.

	   "output" is a reference to either a file handle that has already
	   been opened or to an array.

	   "pretty_print" is an option to print a new line at the end of each
	   element sequence.  It makes the reading of the XML output easier
	   for a human.

	   Example

	     my $dsml = Net::LDAP::DSML-&gtnew();
	     Prints xml data to standard out.

	     my $dsml = Net::LDAP::DSML-&gtnew(output =&gt \@array);
	     my $dsml = Net::LDAP::DSML-&gtnew(output =&gt *FILE);
	     Prints xml data to a file or array.

	     my $dsml = Net::LDAP::DSML-&gtnew(output =&gt \@array, pretty_print =&gt 1);
	     my $dsml = Net::LDAP::DSML-&gtnew(output =&gt *FILE, pretty_print =&gt 1);
	     Prints xml data to a file or array in pretty print style.

METHODS
       start_dsml ()
	   Start a DSML file.

       end_dsml ()
	   End a DSML file.

       write_entry ( ENTRY )
	   Entry is a Net::LDAP::Entry object. The write method will parse the
	   LDAP data in the Entry object and put it into DSML XML format.

	   Example

	     my $entry = $mesg-&gtentry();
	     $dsml-&gtwrite_entry($entry);

       write_schema ( SCHEMA )
	   Schema is a Net::LDAP::Schema object. The write_schema method will
	   parse the LDAP data in the Schema object and put it into DSML XML
	   format.

	   Example

	     my $schema = $ldap-&gtschema();
	     $dsml-&gtwrite_schema($schema);
