NAME
       img-tiff - Img, Tagged Image File Format (tiff)

SYNOPSIS
       package require Tk

       package require img::tiff  ?1.4?

       image create photo ?name? ?options?

_________________________________________________________________

DESCRIPTION
       The  package  img::tiff	is a sub-package of Img. It can be loaded as a
       part of the complete Img support, via package require Img,  or  on  its
       own, via package require img::tiff.

       Like  all packages of Img it does not provide new commands, but extends
       the existing Tk command image so  that  it  supports  files  containing
       raster images in the Tagged Image File Format (tiff). More specifically
       img::tiff extends Tk's photo image type.

       The name of the new format handler is tiff.  This handler provides  new
       additional  configuration  options.  See  section TIFF OPTIONS for more
       detailed explanations.

       All of the above means that in a call like

       image create photo ?name? ?options?


       [1]    Image data in tiff format (options -data and -file) is  detected
	      automatically.

       [2]    The  format  name  tiff is recognized by the option -format.  In
	      addition the value for the option is treated  as	list  and  may
	      contain  any  of	the  special  options  listed  in section TIFF
	      OPTIONS.


TIFF OPTIONS
       The handler provides three options, one for reading from a TIFF	image,
       the other two influencing the writing of such.

       -index n
	      This  option is for reading from TIFF files containing more than
	      one image (multi-page TIFF. When specified it will read the n'th
	      image  in  the  data.  The first image is at index 0 and will be
	      read by default, i.e. when the option is not specified.

       -compression type
	      This option specifies the type of compression to use when  writ-
	      ing  TIFF  data.	It  has  to be one of none, jpeg, packbits, or
	      deflate. The default is none.

       -byteorder type
	      This option specifies the byteorder to  use  when  writing  TIFF
	      data.  It  has  to  be  one of bigendian, littleendian, network,
	      smallendian, or the empty  string.  The  default	is  the  empty
	      string.

	      The  values  bigendian and network are aliases of each other, as
	      are littleendian and smallendian.
