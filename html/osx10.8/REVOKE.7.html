DESCRIPTION
       The REVOKE command revokes previously granted privileges from one or
       more roles. The key word PUBLIC refers to the implicitly defined group
       of all roles.

       See the description of the GRANT(7) command for the meaning of the
       privilege types.

       Note that any particular role will have the sum of privileges granted
       directly to it, privileges granted to any role it is presently a member
       of, and privileges granted to PUBLIC. Thus, for example, revoking
       SELECT privilege from PUBLIC does not necessarily mean that all roles
       have lost SELECT privilege on the object: those who have it granted
       directly or via another role will still have it. Similarly, revoking
       SELECT from a user might not prevent that user from using SELECT if
       PUBLIC or another membership role still has SELECT rights.

       If GRANT OPTION FOR is specified, only the grant option for the
       privilege is revoked, not the privilege itself. Otherwise, both the
       privilege and the grant option are revoked.

       If a user holds a privilege with grant option and has granted it to
       other users then the privileges held by those other users are called
       dependent privileges. If the privilege or the grant option held by the
       first user is being revoked and dependent privileges exist, those
       dependent privileges are also revoked if CASCADE is specified; if it is
       not, the revoke action will fail. This recursive revocation only
       affects privileges that were granted through a chain of users that is
       traceable to the user that is the subject of this REVOKE command. Thus,
       the affected users might effectively keep the privilege if it was also
       granted through other users.

       When revoking privileges on a table, the corresponding column
       privileges (if any) are automatically revoked on each column of the
       table, as well.

       When revoking membership in a role, GRANT OPTION is instead called
       ADMIN OPTION, but the behavior is similar. Note also that this form of
       the command does not allow the noise word GROUP.

NOTES
       Use psql(1)'s \dp command to display the privileges granted on existing
       tables and columns. See GRANT(7) for information about the format. For
       non-table objects there are other \d commands that can display their
       privileges.

       A user can only revoke privileges that were granted directly by that
       user. If, for example, user A has granted a privilege with grant option
       to user B, and user B has in turned granted it to user C, then user A
       cannot revoke the privilege directly from C. Instead, user A could
       revoke the grant option from user B and use the CASCADE option so that
       the privilege is in turn revoked from user C. For another example, if
       both A and B have granted the same privilege to C, A can revoke his own
       grant but not B's grant, so C will still effectively have the
       privilege.

       When a non-owner of an object attempts to REVOKE privileges on the
       object, the command will fail outright if the user has no privileges
       whatsoever on the object. As long as some privilege is available, the
       command will proceed, but it will revoke only those privileges for
       which the user has grant options. The REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES forms will
       issue a warning message if no grant options are held, while the other
       forms will issue a warning if grant options for any of the privileges
       specifically named in the command are not held. (In principle these
       statements apply to the object owner as well, but since the owner is
       always treated as holding all grant options, the cases can never
       occur.)

       If a superuser chooses to issue a GRANT or REVOKE command, the command
       is performed as though it were issued by the owner of the affected
       object. Since all privileges ultimately come from the object owner
       (possibly indirectly via chains of grant options), it is possible for a
       superuser to revoke all privileges, but this might require use of
       CASCADE as stated above.


       REVOKE can also be done by a role that is not the owner of the affected
       object, but is a member of the role that owns the object, or is a
       member of a role that holds privileges WITH GRANT OPTION on the object.
       In this case the command is performed as though it were issued by the
       containing role that actually owns the object or holds the privileges
       WITH GRANT OPTION. For example, if table t1 is owned by role g1, of
       which role u1 is a member, then u1 can revoke privileges on t1 that are
       recorded as being granted by g1. This would include grants made by u1
       as well as by other members of role g1.

       If the role executing REVOKE holds privileges indirectly via more than
       one role membership path, it is unspecified which containing role will
       be used to perform the command. In such cases it is best practice to
       use SET ROLE to become the specific role you want to do the REVOKE as.
       Failure to do so might lead to revoking privileges other than the ones
       you intended, or not revoking anything at all.

EXAMPLES
       Revoke insert privilege for the public on table films:

	   REVOKE INSERT ON films FROM PUBLIC;

       Revoke all privileges from user manuel on view kinds:

	   REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES ON kinds FROM manuel;

       Note that this actually means "revoke all privileges that I granted".

       Revoke membership in role admins from user joe:

	   REVOKE admins FROM joe;

COMPATIBILITY
       The compatibility notes of the GRANT(7) command apply analogously to
       REVOKE. The keyword RESTRICT or CASCADE is required according to the
       standard, but PostgreSQL assumes RESTRICT by default.
