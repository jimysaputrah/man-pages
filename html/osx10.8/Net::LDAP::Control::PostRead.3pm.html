NAME
       Net::LDAP::Control::PostRead - LDAPv3 Post-Read control object

SYNOPSIS
	use Net::LDAP;
	use Net::LDAP::Control::PostRead;
	use Net::LDAP::Constant qw( LDAP_CONTROL_POSTREAD LDAP_SUCCESS );

	$ldap = Net::LDAP->new( "ldap.mydomain.eg" );

	$postread = Net::LDAP::Control::Paged->new( attrs => [ qw/givenName/ ] );

	my $mesg = $ldap->modify( "cn=Barbara Jensen, o=University of Michigan, c=US",
				  replace => { givenName => "Babs" },
				  control => $postread );

	if ($mesg->code eq LDAP_SUCCESS) {
	  my ($afterwards) = $mesg->control( LDAP_CONTROL_PREREAD );
	  my $entry = $afterwards ? $afterwards->entry() : undef;

	  if ($entry) {
	    print "givenName changed to '" .
		  join("', '", $entry->get_value(givenName") .
		  "' to 'Babs'\n");
	  }
	}

DESCRIPTION
       "Net::LDAP::Control::PostRead" provides an interface for the creation
       and manipulation of objects that represent the "Post-Read Control" as
       described by RFC 4527.

CONSTRUCTOR ARGUMENTS
       In addition to the constructor arguments described in
       Net::LDAP::Control the following are provided.

       attrs => [ ATTR, ... ]
	   A list of attributes to be returned in the entry returned in the
	   response control.

	   If absent, all attributes are returned.

	   Operational attributes may be included in the list by explicitely
	   asking for them or by using special "+" feature (provided the
	   server supports this feature).

METHODS
       As with Net::LDAP::Control each constructor argument described above is
       also avaliable as a method on the object which will return the current
       value for the attribute if called without an argument, and set a new
       value for the attribute if called with an argument.

       In addition to these methods, the control also supports the following
       method:

       entry ()
	   Returns the entry from the response control in the response message
	   to the LDAP request that contained the request control.

	   The result is either a Net::LDAP::Entry object or undefined.
