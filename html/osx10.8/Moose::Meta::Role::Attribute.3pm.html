NAME
       Moose::Meta::Role::Attribute - The Moose attribute metaclass for Roles

VERSION
       version 2.0205

DESCRIPTION
       This class implements the API for attributes in roles. Attributes in
       roles are more like attribute prototypes than full blown attributes.
       While they are introspectable, they have very little behavior.

METHODS
       This class provides the following methods:

       Moose::Meta::Role::Attribute->new(...)
	   This method accepts all the options that would be passed to the
	   constructor for Moose::Meta::Attribute.

       $attr->metaclass
       $attr->is
	   Returns the option as passed to the constructor.

       $attr->associated_role
	   Returns the Moose::Meta::Role to which this attribute belongs, if
	   any.

       $attr->original_role
	   Returns the Moose::Meta::Role in which this attribute was first
	   defined. This may not be the same as the value "associated_role()"
	   in the case of composite role, or the case where one role consumes
	   other roles.

       $attr->original_options
	   Returns a hash reference of options passed to the constructor. This
	   is used when creating a Moose::Meta::Attribute object from this
	   object.

       $attr->attach_to_role($role)
	   Attaches the attribute to the given Moose::Meta::Role.

       $attr->attribute_for_class($metaclass)
	   Given an attribute metaclass name, this method calls
	   "$metaclass->interpolate_class_and_new" to construct an attribute
	   object which can be added to a Moose::Meta::Class.

       $attr->clone
	   Creates a new object identical to the object on which the method is
	   called.

       $attr->is_same_as($other_attr)
	   Compares two role attributes and returns true if they are
	   identical.

       In addition, this class implements all informational predicates
       implements by Moose::Meta::Attribute (and Class::MOP::Attribute).
