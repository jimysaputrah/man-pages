NAME
       Net::DNS::Question - DNS question class

SYNOPSIS
       "use Net::DNS::Question"

DESCRIPTION
       A "Net::DNS::Question" object represents a record in the question
       section of a DNS packet.

METHODS
   new
	   $question = Net::DNS::Question-&gtnew("example.com", "MX", "IN");

       Creates a question object from the domain, type, and class passed as
       arguments.

       RFC4291 and RFC4632 IP address/prefix notation is supported for queries
       in in-addr.arpa and ip6.arpa subdomains.

   parse
	   ($question, $offset) = Net::DNS::Question-&gtparse(\$data, $offset);

       Parses a question section record at the specified location within a DNS
       packet.	The first argument is a reference to the packet data.  The
       second argument is the offset within the packet where the question
       record begins.

       Returns a Net::DNS::Question object and the offset of the next location
       in the packet.

       Parsing is aborted if the question object cannot be created (e.g.,
       corrupt or insufficient data).

   qname, zname
	   print "qname = ", $question-&gtqname, "\n";
	   print "zname = ", $question-&gtzname, "\n";

       Returns the domain name.  In dynamic update packets, this field is
       known as "zname" and refers to the zone name.

   qtype, ztype
	   print "qtype = ", $question-&gtqtype, "\n";
	   print "ztype = ", $question-&gtztype, "\n";

       Returns the record type.  In dymamic update packets, this field is
       known as "ztype" and refers to the zone type (must be SOA).

   qclass, zclass
	   print "qclass = ", $question-&gtqclass, "\n";
	   print "zclass = ", $question-&gtzclass, "\n";

       Returns the record class.  In dynamic update packets, this field is
       known as "zclass" and refers to the zone's class.

   print
	   $question-&gtprint;

       Prints the question record on the standard output.

   string
	   print $qr-&gtstring, "\n";

       Returns a string representation of the question record.

   data
	   $qdata = $question-&gtdata($packet, $offset);

       Returns the question record in binary format suitable for inclusion in
       a DNS packet.

       Arguments are a "Net::DNS::Packet" object and the offset within that
       packet's data where the "Net::DNS::Question" record is to be stored.
       This information is necessary for using compressed domain names.
