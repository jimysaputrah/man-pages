NAME
       glFlush - force execution of GL commands in finite time


C SPECIFICATION
       void glFlush( void )


DESCRIPTION
       Different GL implementations buffer commands in several different loca-
       tions, including network buffers and the graphics  accelerator  itself.
       glFlush empties all of these buffers, causing all issued commands to be
       executed as quickly as  they  are  accepted  by	the  actual  rendering
       engine.	 Though  this execution may not be completed in any particular
       time period, it does complete in finite time.

       Because any GL program might be executed  over  a  network,  or	on  an
       accelerator  that  buffers  commands,  all programs should call glFlush
       whenever they count on having all of their previously  issued  commands
       completed.   For  example,  call  glFlush before waiting for user input
       that depends on the generated image.

NOTES
       glFlush can return at any time.	It does not wait until	the  execution
       of all previously issued GL commands is complete.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_OPERATION  is  generated  if glFlush is executed between the
       execution of glBegin and the corresponding execution of glEnd.

       glFinish
