RELEASE SAVEPOINT(7)	PostgreSQL 9.1.4 Documentation	  RELEASE SAVEPOINT(7)



NAME
       RELEASE_SAVEPOINT - destroy a previously defined savepoint

SYNOPSIS
       RELEASE [ SAVEPOINT ] savepoint_name

DESCRIPTION
       RELEASE SAVEPOINT destroys a savepoint previously defined in the
       current transaction.

       Destroying a savepoint makes it unavailable as a rollback point, but it
       has no other user visible behavior. It does not undo the effects of
       commands executed after the savepoint was established. (To do that, see
       ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT (ROLLBACK_TO_SAVEPOINT(7)).) Destroying a
       savepoint when it is no longer needed allows the system to reclaim some
       resources earlier than transaction end.


       RELEASE SAVEPOINT also destroys all savepoints that were established
       after the named savepoint was established.

PARAMETERS
       savepoint_name
	   The name of the savepoint to destroy.

NOTES
       Specifying a savepoint name that was not previously defined is an
       error.

       It is not possible to release a savepoint when the transaction is in an
       aborted state.

       If multiple savepoints have the same name, only the one that was most
       recently defined is released.

EXAMPLES
       To establish and later destroy a savepoint:

	   BEGIN;
	       INSERT INTO table1 VALUES (3);
	       SAVEPOINT my_savepoint;
	       INSERT INTO table1 VALUES (4);
	       RELEASE SAVEPOINT my_savepoint;
	   COMMIT;

       The above transaction will insert both 3 and 4.

COMPATIBILITY
       This command conforms to the SQL standard. The standard specifies that
       the key word SAVEPOINT is mandatory, but PostgreSQL allows it to be
       omitted.
