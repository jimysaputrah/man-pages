NAME
     mskanji -- Shift-JIS (MS Kanji) encoding for Japanese text

SYNOPSIS
     ENCODING "MSKanji"

DESCRIPTION
     Shift-JIS, also known as MS Kanji or SJIS, is an encoding system for
     Japanese characters, developed by Microsoft Corporation.  It encodes the
     characters from the JIS X 0201 (ASCII/JIS-Roman) and JIS X 0208
     (Japanese) character sets as sequences of either one or two bytes.

     Characters from the ASCII/JIS-Roman character set are encoded as single
     bytes between 0x00 and 0x7F (ASCII) or 0xA1 and 0xDF (Half-width
     katakana).

     Characters from the JIS X 0208 character set are encoded as two bytes.
     The first ranges from 0x81 - 0x9F, 0xE0 - 0xEA, 0xED - 0xEE (not JIS:
     NEC-selected IBM extended characters), 0xF0 - 0xF9 (not JIS: user
     defined), or 0xFA - 0xFC (not JIS: IBM extended characters).  The second
     byte ranges from 0x40 - 0xFC, excluding 0x7F (delete).
