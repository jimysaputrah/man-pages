NEXTWCTYPE(3)		 BSD Library Functions Manual		 NEXTWCTYPE(3)

NAME
     nextwctype, nextwctype_l -- iterate through character classes

LIBRARY
     Standard C Library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
     #include &ltwctype.h&gt

     wint_t
     nextwctype(wint_t ch, wctype_t wct);

     #include &ltxlocale.h&gt

     wint_t
     nextwctype_l(wint_t ch, wctype_t wct, locale_t loc);

DESCRIPTION
     The nextwctype() function determines the next character after ch that is
     a member of character class wct.  If ch is -1, the search begins at the
     first member of wct.

     While the nextwctype() function uses the current locale, the
      .Fn nextwctype_l function may be passed a locale directly. See
     xlocale(3) for more information.

RETURN VALUES
     The nextwctype() function returns the next character, or -1 if there are
     no more.

COMPATIBILITY
     This function is a non-standard FreeBSD extension and should not be used
     where the standard iswctype() function would suffice.

SEE ALSO
     wctype(3), xlocale(3)

HISTORY
     The nextwctype() function appeared in FreeBSD 5.4.
