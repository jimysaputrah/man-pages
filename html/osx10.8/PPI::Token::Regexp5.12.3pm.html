NAME
       PPI::Token::Regexp - Regular expression abstract base class

INHERITANCE
	 PPI::Token::Regexp
	 isa PPI::Token
	     isa PPI::Element

DESCRIPTION
       The "PPI::Token::Regexp" class is never instantiated, and simply
       provides a common abstract base class for the three regular expression
       classes. These being:

       m// - PPI::Token::Regexp::Match
       s/// - PPI::Token::Regexp::Substitute
       tr/// - PPI::Token::Regexp::Transliterate

       The names are hopefully obvious enough not to have to explain what each
       class is. See their pages for more details.

       To save some confusion, it's worth pointing out here that "qr//" is not
       a regular expression (which PPI takes to mean something that will
       actually examine or modify a string), but rather a quote-like operator
       that acts as a constructor for compiled Regexp objects.

METHODS
       The following methods are inherited by this class' offspring:

   get_match_string
       The "get_match_string" method returns the portion of the regexp that
       performs the match.

   get_substitute_string
       The "get_substitute_string" method returns the portion of the regexp
       that is substituted for the match, if any.  If the regexp does not
       substitute, "undef" is returned.

   get_modifiers
       The "get_modifiers" method returns the modifiers of the regexp.

   get_delimiters
       The "get_delimiters" method returns the delimiters of the regexp as an
       array. The first element is the delimiters of the match string, and the
       second element (if any) is the delimiters of the substitute string (if
       any).

SUPPORT
       See the support section in the main module.
