NAME
       Tcl_GetOpenFile	- Return a FILE* for a channel registered in the given
       interpreter (Unix only)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <tcl.h>

       int
       Tcl_GetOpenFile(interp, chanID, write, checkUsage, filePtr)


ARGUMENTS
       Tcl_Interp *interp (in)		   Tcl	interpreter  from  which  file
					   handle is to be obtained.

       const char *chanID (in)		   String identifying channel, such as
					   stdin or file4.

       int write (in)			   Non-zero means  the	file  will  be
					   used  for  writing,	zero  means it
					   will be used for reading.

       int checkUsage (in)		   If non-zero, then an error will  be
					   generated   if  the	file  was  not
					   opened for the access indicated  by
					   write.

       ClientData *filePtr (out)	   Points  to  word  in which to store
					   pointer to FILE structure  for  the
					   file given by chanID.

DESCRIPTION
       Tcl_GetOpenFile	takes  as  argument  a	file  identifier  of  the form
       returned by the open command and returns at *filePtr a pointer  to  the
       FILE  structure for the file.  The write argument indicates whether the
       FILE pointer will be used for reading or writing.  In some cases,  such
       as  a  channel  that  connects to a pipeline of subprocesses, different
       FILE pointers will be returned for reading and  writing.   Tcl_GetOpen-
       File  normally  returns	TCL_OK.  If an error occurs in Tcl_GetOpenFile
       (e.g. chanID did not make any sense or checkUsage was set and the  file
       was  not  opened  for  the access specified by write) then TCL_ERROR is
       returned and the interpreter's result will contain  an  error  message.
       In  the	current  implementation  checkUsage is ignored and consistency
       checks are always performed.

       Note that this interface is only supported on the Unix platform.
