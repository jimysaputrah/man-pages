DESCRIPTION
       This module provides various type-testing functions.  These are
       intended for functions that, unlike most Perl code, care what type of
       data they are operating on.  For example, some functions wish to behave
       differently depending on the type of their arguments (like overloaded
       functions in C++).

       There are two flavours of function in this module.  Functions of the
       first flavour only provide type classification, to allow code to
       discriminate between argument types.  Functions of the second flavour
       package up the most common type of type discrimination: checking that
       an argument is of an expected type.  The functions come in matched
       pairs, of the two flavours, and so the type enforcement functions
       handle only the simplest requirements for arguments of the types
       handled by the classification functions.  Enforcement of more complex
       types may, of course, be built using the classification functions, or
       it may be more convenient to use a module designed for the more complex
       job, such as Params::Validate.

       This module is implemented in XS, with a pure Perl backup version for
       systems that can't handle XS.

TYPE CLASSIFICATION
       This module divides up scalar values into the following classes:

       o   undef

       o   string (defined ordinary scalar)

       o   typeglob (yes, typeglobs fit into scalar variables)

       o   regexp (first-class regular expression objects in Perl 5.11
	   onwards)

       o   reference to unblessed object (further classified by physical data
	   type of the referenced object)

       o   reference to blessed object (further classified by class blessed
	   into)

       These classes are mutually exclusive and should be exhaustive.  This
       classification has been chosen as the most useful when one wishes to
       discriminate between types of scalar.  Other classifications are
       possible.  (For example, the two reference classes are distinguished by
       a feature of the referenced object; Perl does not internally treat this
       as a feature of the reference.)

FUNCTIONS
       Each of these functions takes one scalar argument (ARG) to be tested,
       possibly with other arguments specifying details of the test.  Any
       scalar value is acceptable for the argument to be tested.  Each "is_"
       function returns a simple truth value result, which is true iff ARG is
       of the type being checked for.  Each "check_" function will return
       normally if the argument is of the type being checked for, or will
       "die" if it is not.

   Classification
       scalar_class(ARG)
	   Determines which of the five classes described above ARG falls
	   into.  Returns "UNDEF", "STRING", "GLOB", "REGEXP", "REF", or
	   "BLESSED" accordingly.

   The Undefined Value
       is_undef(ARG)
       check_undef(ARG)
	   Check whether ARG is "undef".  "is_undef(ARG)" is precisely
	   equivalent to "!defined(ARG)", and is included for completeness.

   Strings
       is_string(ARG)
       check_string(ARG)
	   Check whether ARG is defined and is an ordinary scalar value (not a
	   reference, typeglob, or regexp).  This is what one usually thinks
	   of as a string in Perl.  In fact, any scalar (including "undef" and
	   references) can be coerced to a string, but if you're trying to
	   classify a scalar then you don't want to do that.

       is_number(ARG)
       check_number(ARG)
	   Check whether ARG is defined and an ordinary scalar (i.e.,
	   satisfies "is_string" above) and is an acceptable number to Perl.
	   This is what one usually thinks of as a number.

	   Note that simple ("is_string"-satisfying) scalars may have
	   independent numeric and string values, despite the usual pretence
	   that they have only one value.  Such a scalar is deemed to be a
	   number if either it already has a numeric value (e.g., was
	   generated by a numeric literal or an arithmetic computation) or its
	   string value has acceptable syntax for a number (so it can be
	   converted).	Where a scalar has separate numeric and string values
	   (see "dualvar" in Scalar::Util), it is possible for it to have an
	   acceptable numeric value while its string value does not have
	   acceptable numeric syntax.  Be careful to use such a value only in
	   a numeric context, if you are using it as a number.
	   "scalar_num_part" in Scalar::Number extracts the numeric part of a
	   scalar as an ordinary number.  ("0+ARG" suffices for that unless
	   you need to preserve floating point signed zeroes.)

	   A number may be either a native integer or a native floating point
	   value, and there are several subtypes of floating point value.  For
	   classification, and other handling of numbers in scalars, see
	   Scalar::Number.  For details of the two numeric data types, see
	   Data::Integer and Data::Float.

	   This function differs from "looks_like_number" (see
	   "looks_like_number" in Scalar::Util; also "looks_like_number" in
	   perlapi for a lower-level description) in excluding "undef",
	   typeglobs, and references.  Why "looks_like_number" returns true
	   for "undef" or typeglobs is anybody's guess.  References, if
	   treated as numbers, evaluate to the address in memory that they
	   reference; this is useful for comparing references for equality,
	   but it is not otherwise useful to treat references as numbers.
	   Blessed references may have overloaded numeric operators, but if so
	   then they don't necessarily behave like ordinary numbers.
	   "looks_like_number" is also confused by dualvars: it looks at the
	   string portion of the scalar.

   Typeglobs
       is_glob(ARG)
       check_glob(ARG)
	   Check whether ARG is a typeglob.

   Regexps
       is_regexp(ARG)
       check_regexp(ARG)
	   Check whether ARG is a regexp object.

   References to Unblessed Objects
       is_ref(ARG)
       check_ref(ARG)
	   Check whether ARG is a reference to an unblessed object.  If it is,
	   then the referenced data type can be determined using "ref_type"
	   (see below), which will return a string such as "HASH" or "SCALAR".

       ref_type(ARG)
	   Returns "undef" if ARG is not a reference to an unblessed object.
	   Otherwise, determines what type of object is referenced.  Returns
	   "SCALAR", "ARRAY", "HASH", "CODE", "FORMAT", or "IO" accordingly.

	   Note that, unlike "ref", this does not distinguish between
	   different types of referenced scalar.  A reference to a string and
	   a reference to a reference will both return "SCALAR".
	   Consequently, what "ref_type" returns for a particular reference
	   will not change due to changes in the value of the referent, except
	   for the referent being blessed.

       is_ref(ARG, TYPE)
       check_ref(ARG, TYPE)
	   Check whether ARG is a reference to an unblessed object of type
	   TYPE, as determined by "ref_type".  TYPE must be a string.
	   Possible TYPEs are "SCALAR", "ARRAY", "HASH", "CODE", "FORMAT", and
	   "IO".

   References to Blessed Objects
       is_blessed(ARG)
       check_blessed(ARG)
	   Check whether ARG is a reference to a blessed object.  If it is,
	   then the class into which the object was blessed can be determined
	   using "blessed_class".

       is_blessed(ARG, CLASS)
       check_blessed(ARG, CLASS)
	   Check whether ARG is a reference to a blessed object that claims to
	   be an instance of CLASS (via its "isa" method; see "isa" in
	   perlobj).  CLASS must be a string, naming a Perl class.

       blessed_class(ARG)
	   Returns "undef" if ARG is not a reference to a blessed object.
	   Otherwise, returns the class into which the object is blessed.

	   "ref" (see "ref" in perlfunc) gives the same result on references
	   to blessed objects, but different results on other types of value.
	   "blessed_class" is actually identical to "blessed" in Scalar::Util.

       is_strictly_blessed(ARG)
       check_strictly_blessed(ARG)
	   Check whether ARG is a reference to a blessed object, identically
	   to "is_blessed".  This exists only for symmetry; the useful form of
	   "is_strictly_blessed" appears below.

       is_strictly_blessed(ARG, CLASS)
       check_strictly_blessed(ARG, CLASS)
	   Check whether ARG is a reference to an object blessed into CLASS
	   exactly.  CLASS must be a string, naming a Perl class.  Because
	   this excludes subclasses, this is rarely what one wants, but there
	   are some specialised occasions where it is useful.

       is_able(ARG)
       check_able(ARG)
	   Check whether ARG is a reference to a blessed object, identically
	   to "is_blessed".  This exists only for symmetry; the useful form of
	   "is_able" appears below.

       is_able(ARG, METHODS)
       check_able(ARG, METHODS)
	   Check whether ARG is a reference to a blessed object that claims to
	   implement the methods specified by METHODS (via its "can" method;
	   see "can" in perlobj).  METHODS must be either a single method name
	   or a reference to an array of method names.	Each method name is a
	   string.  This interface check is often more appropriate than a
	   direct ancestry check (such as "is_blessed" performs).

BUGS
       Probably ought to handle something like Params::Validate's scalar type
       specification system, which makes much the same distinctions.
