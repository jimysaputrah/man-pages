NAME
       MooseX::ClassAttribute::Trait::Attribute - A trait for class attributes

VERSION
       version 0.26

DESCRIPTION
       This role modifies the behavior of class attributes in various ways. It
       really should be a subclass of "Moose::Meta::Attribute", but if it were
       then it couldn't be combined with other attribute metaclasses, like
       "MooseX::AttributeHelpers".

       There are no new public methods implemented by this role. All it does
       is change the behavior of a number of existing methods.

BUGS
       See MooseX::ClassAttribute for details.
