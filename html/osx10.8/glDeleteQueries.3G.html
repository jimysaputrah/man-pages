NAME
       glDeleteQueries - delete named query objects

C SPECIFICATION
       void glDeleteQueries(GLsizei n, const GLuint * ids);

PARAMETERS
       n
	   Specifies the number of query objects to be deleted.

       ids
	   Specifies an array of query objects to be deleted.

DESCRIPTION
       glDeleteQueries deletes n query objects named by the elements of the
       array ids. After a query object is deleted, it has no contents, and its
       name is free for reuse (for example by glGenQueries()).


       glDeleteQueries silently ignores 0's and names that do not correspond
       to existing query objects.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if n is negative.


       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if glDeleteQueries is executed
       between the execution of glBeginQuery() and the corresponding execution
       of glEndQuery().

ASSOCIATED GETS
       glIsQuery()

SEE ALSO
       glBeginQuery(), glEndQuery(), glGenQueries(), glGetQueryiv(),
       glGetQueryObject()
