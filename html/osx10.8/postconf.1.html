       Managing main.cf:

       postconf [-dfhnv] [-c config_dir] [-C class,...] [parameter ...]

       postconf [-ev] [-c config_dir] [parameter=value ...]

       postconf [-#v] [-c config_dir] [parameter ...]

       Managing master.cf:

       postconf [-fMv] [-c config_dir] [service ...]

       Managing bounce message templates:

       postconf [-btv] [-c config_dir] [template_file]

       Managing other configuration:

       postconf [-aAlmv] [-c config_dir]

DESCRIPTION
       By default, the postconf(1) command displays the values of main.cf con-
       figuration parameters, and warns  about	possible  mis-typed  parameter
       names  (Postfix	2.9 and later).  It can also change main.cf configura-
       tion parameter values, or display other configuration information about
       the Postfix mail system.

       Options:

       -a     List  the available SASL server plug-in types.  The SASL plug-in
	      type is selected with the smtpd_sasl_type configuration  parame-
	      ter by specifying one of the names listed below.

	      cyrus  This  server  plug-in  is available when Postfix is built
		     with Cyrus SASL support.

	      dovecot
		     This  server  plug-in  uses  the  Dovecot	authentication
		     server,  and  is available when Postfix is built with any
		     form of SASL support.

	      This feature is available with Postfix 2.3 and later.

       -A     List the available SASL client plug-in types.  The SASL  plug-in
	      type  is selected with the smtp_sasl_type or lmtp_sasl_type con-
	      figuration parameters by specifying  one	of  the  names	listed
	      below.

	      cyrus  This  client  plug-in  is available when Postfix is built
		     with Cyrus SASL support.

	      This feature is available with Postfix 2.3 and later.

       -b [template_file]
	      Display the message text that appears at the beginning of deliv-
	      ery  status notification (DSN) messages, replacing $name expres-
	      sions with actual values as described in bounce(5).

	      To override the built-in templates, specify a template file name
	      at  the  end  of the postconf(1) command line, or specify a file
	      name in main.cf with the bounce_template_file parameter.

	      To force selection of the built-in templates, specify  an  empty
	      template	file  name  on	the postconf(1) command line (in shell
	      language: "").

	      This feature is available with Postfix 2.3 and later.

       -c config_dir
	      The main.cf configuration file is in the named directory instead
	      of the default configuration directory.

       -C class,...
	      When  displaying main.cf parameters, select only parameters from
	      the specified class(es):

	      builtin
		     Parameters with built-in names.

	      service
		     Parameters with service-defined names (the first field of
		     a master.cf entry plus a Postfix-defined suffix).

	      user   Parameters with user-defined names.

	      all    All the above classes.

	      The default is as if "-C all" is specified.

       -d     Print  main.cf default parameter settings instead of actual set-
	      tings.  Specify -df to fold long	lines  for  human  readability
	      (Postfix 2.9 and later).

       -e     Edit  the  main.cf configuration file, and update parameter set-
	      tings with the "name=value" pairs  on  the  postconf(1)  command
	      line.  The  file is copied to a temporary file then renamed into
	      place.  Specify quotes to protect special characters and	white-
	      space on the postconf(1) command line.

	      The -e is no longer needed with Postfix version 2.8 and later.

       -f     Fold long lines when printing main.cf or master.cf configuration
	      file entries, for human readability.

	      This feature is available with Postfix 2.9 and later.

       -h     Show main.cf parameter values without the "name = "  label  that
	      normally precedes the value.

       -l     List  the names of all supported mailbox locking methods.  Post-
	      fix supports the following methods:

	      flock  A kernel-based advisory locking method  for  local  files
		     only.  This locking method is available on systems with a
		     BSD compatible library.

	      fcntl  A kernel-based advisory  locking  method  for  local  and
		     remote files.

	      dotlock
		     An application-level locking method. An application locks
		     a file named filename by  creating  a  file  named  file-
		     name.lock.  The application is expected to remove its own
		     lock file, as well as stale lock  files  that  were  left
		     behind after abnormal termination.

       -m     List  the  names of all supported lookup table types. In Postfix
	      configuration files, lookup tables are specified	as  type:name,
	      where type is one of the types listed below. The table name syn-
	      tax depends on the lookup table type as described in  the  DATA-
	      BASE_README document.

	      btree  A	sorted, balanced tree structure.  This is available on
		     systems with support for Berkeley DB databases.

	      cdb    A read-optimized structure with no support for  incremen-
		     tal  updates.   This is available on systems with support
		     for CDB databases.

	      cidr   A table that  associates  values  with  Classless	Inter-
		     Domain  Routing  (CIDR)  patterns.  This  is described in
		     cidr_table(5).

	      dbm    An indexed file type based on hashing.  This is available
		     on systems with support for DBM databases.

	      environ
		     The UNIX process environment array. The lookup key is the
		     variable name. Originally implemented for testing,  some-
		     one may find this useful someday.

	      fail   A	table that reliably fails all requests. The lookup ta-
		     ble name is used for logging. This table exists  to  sim-
		     plify Postfix error tests.

	      hash   An indexed file type based on hashing.  This is available
		     on systems with support for Berkeley DB databases.

	      internal
		     A non-shared, in-memory hash table. Its content are  lost
		     when a process terminates.

	      ldap (read-only)
		     Perform   lookups	 using	the  LDAP  protocol.  This  is
		     described in ldap_table(5).

	      memcache
		     Perform lookups using  the  memcache  protocol.  This  is
		     described in memcache_table(5).

	      mysql (read-only)
		     Perform   lookups	using  the  MYSQL  protocol.  This  is
		     described in mysql_table(5).

	      pcre (read-only)
		     A lookup table based on Perl Compatible  Regular  Expres-
		     sions. The file format is described in pcre_table(5).

	      pgsql (read-only)
		     Perform  lookups  using  the PostgreSQL protocol. This is
		     described in pgsql_table(5).

	      proxy  A lookup table that is implemented via the Postfix  prox-
		     ymap(8) service. The table name syntax is type:name.

	      regexp (read-only)
		     A	lookup	table  based  on regular expressions. The file
		     format is described in regexp_table(5).

	      sdbm   An indexed file type based on hashing.  This is available
		     on systems with support for SDBM databases.

	      sqlite (read-only)
		     Perform  lookups  from  SQLite  database  files.  This is
		     described in sqlite_table(5).

	      static (read-only)
		     A table that always returns its name  as  lookup  result.
		     For example, static:foobar always returns the string foo-
		     bar as lookup result.

	      tcp (read-only)
		     Perform lookups using  a  simple  request-reply  protocol
		     that is described in tcp_table(5).

	      texthash (read-only)
		     Produces  similar results as hash: files, except that you
		     don't need to run the postmap(1) command before  you  can
		     use  the  file, and that it does not detect changes after
		     the file is read.

	      unix (read-only)
		     A limited way to query the UNIX authentication  database.
		     The following tables are implemented:

		     unix:passwd.byname
			    The  table	is the UNIX password database. The key
			    is a login name.  The result is  a	password  file
			    entry in passwd(5) format.

		     unix:group.byname
			    The table is the UNIX group database. The key is a
			    group name.  The result is a group file  entry  in
			    group(5) format.

	      Other  table types may exist depending on how Postfix was built.

       -M     Show master.cf file contents instead of main.cf  file  contents.
	      Specify -Mf to fold long lines for human readability.

	      If  service ... is specified, only the matching services will be
	      output. For example, "postconf -Mf inet" will  output  all  ser-
	      vices that listen on the network.

	      Specify  zero  or  more arguments, each with a service-type name
	      (inet, unix, fifo, or pass) or with a  service-name.service-type
	      pair,  where  service-name  is  the  first  field of a master.cf
	      entry.

	      This feature is available with Postfix 2.9 and later.

       -n     Print main.cf parameter settings that are  explicitly  specified
	      in  main.cf.  Specify -nf to fold long lines for human readabil-
	      ity (Postfix 2.9 and later).

       -t [template_file]
	      Display the templates for text that appears at the beginning  of
	      delivery	status	notification (DSN) messages, without expanding
	      $name expressions.

	      To override the built-in templates, specify a template file name
	      at  the  end  of the postconf(1) command line, or specify a file
	      name in main.cf with the bounce_template_file parameter.

	      To force selection of the built-in templates, specify  an  empty
	      template	file  name  on	the postconf(1) command line (in shell
	      language: "").

	      This feature is available with Postfix 2.3 and later.

       -v     Enable verbose  logging  for  debugging  purposes.  Multiple  -v
	      options make the software increasingly verbose.

       -#     Edit the main.cf configuration file, and comment out the parame-
	      ters given on the postconf(1) command line, so that those param-
	      eters  revert  to their default values.  The file is copied to a
	      temporary file then renamed  into  place.   Specify  a  list  of
	      parameter  names, not name=value pairs.  There is no postconf(1)
	      command to perform the reverse operation.

	      This feature is available with Postfix 2.6 and later.
