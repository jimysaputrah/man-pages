NAME
       git-merge-file - Run a three-way file merge

SYNOPSIS
       git merge-file [-L &ltcurrent-name&gt [-L &ltbase-name&gt [-L &ltother-name&gt]]]
	       [--ours|--theirs|--union] [-p|--stdout] [-q|--quiet] [--marker-size=&ltn&gt]
	       &ltcurrent-file&gt &ltbase-file&gt &ltother-file&gt


DESCRIPTION
       git merge-file incorporates all changes that lead from the &ltbase-file&gt
       to &ltother-file&gt into &ltcurrent-file&gt. The result ordinarily goes into
       &ltcurrent-file&gt. git merge-file is useful for combining separate changes
       to an original. Suppose &ltbase-file&gt is the original, and both
       &ltcurrent-file&gt and &ltother-file&gt are modifications of &ltbase-file&gt, then
       git merge-file combines both changes.

       A conflict occurs if both &ltcurrent-file&gt and &ltother-file&gt have changes
       in a common segment of lines. If a conflict is found, git merge-file
       normally outputs a warning and brackets the conflict with lines
       containing &lt&lt&lt&lt&lt&lt&lt and &gt&gt&gt&gt&gt&gt&gt markers. A typical conflict will look
       like this:

	   &lt&lt&lt&lt&lt&lt&lt A
	   lines in file A
	   =======
	   lines in file B
	   &gt&gt&gt&gt&gt&gt&gt B

       If there are conflicts, the user should edit the result and delete one
       of the alternatives. When --ours, --theirs, or --union option is in
       effect, however, these conflicts are resolved favouring lines from
       &ltcurrent-file&gt, lines from &ltother-file&gt, or lines from both
       respectively. The length of the conflict markers can be given with the
       --marker-size option.

       The exit value of this program is negative on error, and the number of
       conflicts otherwise. If the merge was clean, the exit value is 0.

       git merge-file is designed to be a minimal clone of RCS merge; that is,
       it implements all of RCS merge's functionality which is needed by
       git(1).

OPTIONS
       -L &ltlabel&gt
	   This option may be given up to three times, and specifies labels to
	   be used in place of the corresponding file names in conflict
	   reports. That is, git merge-file -L x -L y -L z a b c generates
	   output that looks like it came from files x, y and z instead of
	   from files a, b and c.

       -p
	   Send results to standard output instead of overwriting
	   &ltcurrent-file&gt.

       -q
	   Quiet; do not warn about conflicts.

       --ours, --theirs, --union
	   Instead of leaving conflicts in the file, resolve conflicts
	   favouring our (or their or both) side of the lines.

EXAMPLES
       git merge-file README.my README README.upstream
	   combines the changes of README.my and README.upstream since README,
	   tries to merge them and writes the result into README.my.

       git merge-file -L a -L b -L c tmp/a123 tmp/b234 tmp/c345
	   merges tmp/a123 and tmp/c345 with the base tmp/b234, but uses
	   labels a and c instead of tmp/a123 and tmp/c345.
