NAME
       PPI::Statement::Sub - Subroutine declaration

INHERITANCE
	 PPI::Statement::Sub
	 isa PPI::Statement
	     isa PPI::Node
		 isa PPI::Element

DESCRIPTION
       Except for the special BEGIN, CHECK, UNITCHECK, INIT, and END
       subroutines (which are part of PPI::Statement::Scheduled) all
       subroutine declarations are lexed as a PPI::Statement::Sub object.

       Primarily, this means all of the various "sub foo {}" statements, but
       also forward declarations such as "sub foo;" or "sub foo($);". It does
       not include anonymous subroutines, as these are merely part of a normal
       statement.

METHODS
       "PPI::Statement::Sub" has a number of methods in addition to the
       standard PPI::Statement, PPI::Node and PPI::Element methods.

   name
       The "name" method returns the name of the subroutine being declared.

       In some rare cases such as a naked "sub" at the end of the file, this
       may return false.

   prototype
       If it has one, the "prototype" method returns the subroutine's
       prototype.  It is returned in the same format as "prototype" in
       PPI::Token::Prototype, cleaned and removed from its brackets.

       Returns false if the subroutine does not define a prototype

   block
       With its name and implementation shared with PPI::Statement::Scheduled,
       the "block" method finds and returns the actual Structure object of the
       code block for this subroutine.

       Returns false if this is a forward declaration, or otherwise does not
       have a code block.

   forward
       The "forward" method returns true if the subroutine declaration is a
       forward declaration.

       That is, it returns false if the subroutine has a code block, or true
       if it does not.

   reserved
       The "reserved" method provides a convenience method for checking to see
       if this is a special reserved subroutine. It does not check against any
       particular list of reserved sub names, but just returns true if the
       name is all uppercase, as defined in perlsub.

       Note that in the case of BEGIN, CHECK, UNITCHECK, INIT and END, these
       will be defined as PPI::Statement::Scheduled objects, not subroutines.

       Returns true if it is a special reserved subroutine, or false if not.
