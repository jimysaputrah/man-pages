NAME
       curses_version, use_extended_names - miscellaneous curses extensions

SYNOPSIS
       #include &ltcurses.h&gt

       const char * curses_version(void);
       int use_extended_names(bool enable);

DESCRIPTION
       These  functions  are extensions to the curses library which do not fit
       easily into other categories.

       Use curses_version() to get the version number, including  patch  level
       of the library, e.g., 5.0.19991023

       The use_extended_names() function controls whether the calling applica-
       tion is able to use user-defined or nonstandard names which may be com-
       piled  into the terminfo description, i.e., via the terminfo or termcap
       interfaces.  Normally these names are  available  for  use,  since  the
       essential  decision  is	made  by using the -x option of tic to compile
       extended terminal definitions.  However you can disable this feature to
       ensure compatibility with other implementations of curses.

PORTABILITY
       These  routines	are  specific  to ncurses.  They were not supported on
       Version 7, BSD or System V implementations.  It is recommended that any
       code depending on them be conditioned using NCURSES_VERSION.
