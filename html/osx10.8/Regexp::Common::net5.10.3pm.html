NAME
       Regexp::Common::net -- provide regexes for IPv4 addresses.

SYNOPSIS
	   use Regexp::Common qw /net/;

	   while (&lt&gt) {
	       /$RE{net}{IPv4}/       and print "Dotted decimal IP address";
	       /$RE{net}{IPv4}{hex}/  and print "Dotted hexadecimal IP address";
	       /$RE{net}{IPv4}{oct}{-sep =&gt ':'}/ and
				      print "Colon separated octal IP address";
	       /$RE{net}{IPv4}{bin}/  and print "Dotted binary IP address";
	       /$RE{net}{MAC}/	      and print "MAC address";
	       /$RE{net}{MAC}{oct}{-sep =&gt " "}/ and
				      print "Space separated octal MAC address";
	   }

DESCRIPTION
       Please consult the manual of Regexp::Common for a general description
       of the works of this interface.

       Do not use this module directly, but load it via Regexp::Common.

       This modules gives you regular expressions for various style IPv4 and
       MAC (or ethernet) addresses.

   $RE{net}{IPv4}
       Returns a pattern that matches a valid IP address in "dotted decimal".
       Note that while 318.99.183.11 is not a valid IP address, it does match
       "/$RE{net}{IPv4}/", but this is because 318.99.183.11 contains a valid
       IP address, namely 18.99.183.11. To prevent the unwanted matching, one
       needs to anchor the regexp: "/^$RE{net}{IPv4}$/".

       For this pattern and the next four, under "-keep" (See Regexp::Common):

       $1  captures the entire match

       $2  captures the first component of the address

       $3  captures the second component of the address

       $4  captures the third component of the address

       $5  captures the final component of the address

   $RE{net}{IPv4}{dec}{-sep}
       Returns a pattern that matches a valid IP address in "dotted decimal"

       If "-sep=P" is specified the pattern P is used as the separator.  By
       default P is "qr/[.]/".

   $RE{net}{IPv4}{hex}{-sep}
       Returns a pattern that matches a valid IP address in "dotted
       hexadecimal", with the letters "A" to "F" capitalized.

       If "-sep=P" is specified the pattern P is used as the separator.  By
       default P is "qr/[.]/". "-sep=""" and "-sep=" "" are useful
       alternatives.

   $RE{net}{IPv4}{oct}{-sep}
       Returns a pattern that matches a valid IP address in "dotted octal"

       If "-sep=P" is specified the pattern P is used as the separator.  By
       default P is "qr/[.]/".

   $RE{net}{IPv4}{bin}{-sep}
       Returns a pattern that matches a valid IP address in "dotted binary"

       If "-sep=P" is specified the pattern P is used as the separator.  By
       default P is "qr/[.]/".

   $RE{net}{MAC}
       Returns a pattern that matches a valid MAC or ethernet address as colon
       separated hexadecimals.

       For this pattern, and the next four, under "-keep" (See
       Regexp::Common):

       $1  captures the entire match

       $2  captures the first component of the address

       $3  captures the second component of the address

       $4  captures the third component of the address

       $5  captures the fourth component of the address

       $6  captures the fifth component of the address

       $7  captures the sixth and final component of the address

       This pattern, and the next four, have a "subs" method as well, which
       will transform a matching MAC address into so called canonical format.
       Canonical format means that every component of the address will be
       exactly two hexadecimals (with a leading zero if necessary), and the
       components will be separated by a colon.

       The "subs" method will not work for binary MAC addresses if the Perl
       version predates 5.6.0.

   $RE{net}{MAC}{dec}{-sep}
       Returns a pattern that matches a valid MAC address as colon separated
       decimals.

       If "-sep=P" is specified the pattern P is used as the separator.  By
       default P is "qr/:/".

   $RE{net}{MAC}{hex}{-sep}
       Returns a pattern that matches a valid MAC address as colon separated
       hexadecimals, with the letters "a" to "f" in lower case.

       If "-sep=P" is specified the pattern P is used as the separator.  By
       default P is "qr/:/".

   $RE{net}{MAC}{oct}{-sep}
       Returns a pattern that matches a valid MAC address as colon separated
       octals.

       If "-sep=P" is specified the pattern P is used as the separator.  By
       default P is "qr/:/".

   $RE{net}{MAC}{bin}{-sep}
       Returns a pattern that matches a valid MAC address as colon separated
       binary numbers.

       If "-sep=P" is specified the pattern P is used as the separator.  By
       default P is "qr/:/".

   $RE{net}{domain}
       Returns a pattern to match domains (and hosts) as defined in RFC 1035.
       Under I{-keep} only the entire domain name is returned.

       RFC 1035 says that a single space can be a domainname too. So, the
       pattern returned by $RE{net}{domain} recognizes a single space as well.
       This is not always what people want. If you want to recognize
       domainnames, but not a space, you can do one of two things, either use

	   /(?! )$RE{net}{domain}/

       or use the "{-nospace}" option (without an argument).
