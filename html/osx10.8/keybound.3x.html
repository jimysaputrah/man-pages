NAME
       keybound - return definition of keycode

SYNOPSIS
       #include &ltcurses.h&gt

       char * keybound(int keycode, int count);

DESCRIPTION
       This  is an extension to the curses library.  It permits an application
       to determine the string which is defined in the terminfo  for  specific
       keycodes.

RETURN VALUE
       The keycode parameter must be greater than zero, else NULL is returned.
       If it does not correspond to a defined key, then NULL is returned.  The
       count  parameter  is  used  to allow the application to iterate through
       multiple definitions, counting from zero.  When successful,  the  func-
       tion returns a string which must be freed by the caller.

PORTABILITY
       These  routines	are  specific  to ncurses.  They were not supported on
       Version 7, BSD or System V implementations.  It is recommended that any
       code depending on them be conditioned using NCURSES_VERSION.

SEE ALSO
       define_key(3X), keyok(3X).
