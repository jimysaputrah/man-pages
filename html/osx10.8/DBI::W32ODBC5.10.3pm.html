NAME
       DBI::W32ODBC - An experimental DBI emulation layer for Win32::ODBC

SYNOPSIS
	 use DBI::W32ODBC;

	 # apart from the line above everything is just the same as with
	 # the real DBI when using a basic driver with few features.

DESCRIPTION
       This is an experimental pure perl DBI emulation layer for Win32::ODBC

       If you can improve this code I'd be interested in hearing about it. If
       you are having trouble using it please respect the fact that it's very
       experimental. Ideally fix it yourself and send me the details.

   Some Things Not Yet Implemented
	       Most attributes including PrintError & RaiseError.
	       type_info and table_info

       Volunteers welcome!
