NAME
       gluSphere - draw a sphere


C SPECIFICATION
       void gluSphere( GLUquadric* quad,
		       GLdouble radius,
		       GLint slices,
		       GLint stacks )


PARAMETERS
       quad    Specifies the quadrics object (created with gluNewQuadric).

       radius  Specifies the radius of the sphere.

       slices  Specifies the number of subdivisions around the z axis (similar
	       to lines of longitude).

       stacks  Specifies the number of subdivisions along the z axis  (similar
	       to lines of latitude).

DESCRIPTION
       gluSphere  draws  a sphere of the given radius centered around the ori-
       gin. The sphere is subdivided around the z axis into slices  and  along
       the z axis into stacks (similar to lines of longitude and latitude).

       If  the orientation is set to GLU_OUTSIDE (with gluQuadricOrientation),
       then any normals generated point away from the center  of  the  sphere.
       Otherwise, they point toward the center of the sphere.

       If  texturing is turned on (with gluQuadricTexture), then texture coor-
       dinates are generated so that t ranges from 0.0 at z =-radius to 1.0 at
       z  =  radius  (t  increases  linearly  along longitudinal lines), and s
       ranges from 0.0 at the +y axis, to 0.25 at the +x axis, to 0.5  at  the
       -y axis, to 0.75 at the -x axis, and back to 1.0 at the +y axis.
