NAME
       cupsaccept/cupsreject - accept/reject jobs sent to a destination

SYNOPSIS
       cupsaccept [ -E ] [ -U username ] [ -h hostname[:port] ] destination(s)
       cupsreject [ -E ] [ -U username ] [ -h hostname[:port] ] [ -r reason  ]
       destination(s)

DESCRIPTION
       cupsaccept  instructs  the  printing system to accept print jobs to the
       specified destinations.

       cupsreject instructs the printing system to reject print  jobs  to  the
       specified  destinations.  The  -r  option sets the reason for rejecting
       print jobs. If not specified the reason defaults to "Reason Unknown".

OPTIONS
       The following options are supported by both cupsaccept and cupsreject:

       -E
	    Forces encryption when connecting to the server.

       -U username
	    Sets the username that is sent when connecting to the server.

       -h hostname[:port]
	    Chooses an alternate server.

       -r "reason"
	    Sets the reason string that is shown for a printer that is reject-
	    ing jobs.

COMPATIBILITY
       Unlike  the System V printing system, CUPS allows printer names to con-
       tain any printable character except SPACE, TAB,	"/",  or  "#".	 Also,
       printer and class names are not case-sensitive.

       The  CUPS  versions of accept and reject may ask the user for an access
       password depending on the printing system configuration.  This  differs
       from the System V versions which require the root user to execute these
       commands.
