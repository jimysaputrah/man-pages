ALTER COLLATION(7)	PostgreSQL 9.1.4 Documentation	    ALTER COLLATION(7)



NAME
       ALTER_COLLATION - change the definition of a collation

SYNOPSIS
       ALTER COLLATION name RENAME TO new_name
       ALTER COLLATION name OWNER TO new_owner
       ALTER COLLATION name SET SCHEMA new_schema

DESCRIPTION
       ALTER COLLATION changes the definition of a collation.

       You must own the collation to use ALTER COLLATION. To alter the owner,
       you must also be a direct or indirect member of the new owning role,
       and that role must have CREATE privilege on the collation's schema.
       (These restrictions enforce that altering the owner doesn't do anything
       you couldn't do by dropping and recreating the collation. However, a
       superuser can alter ownership of any collation anyway.)

PARAMETERS
       name
	   The name (optionally schema-qualified) of an existing collation.

       new_name
	   The new name of the collation.

       new_owner
	   The new owner of the collation.

       new_schema
	   The new schema for the collation.

EXAMPLES
       To rename the collation de_DE to german:

	   ALTER COLLATION "de_DE" RENAME TO german;

       To change the owner of the collation en_US to joe:

	   ALTER COLLATION "en_US" OWNER TO joe;

COMPATIBILITY
       There is no ALTER COLLATION statement in the SQL standard.

SEE ALSO
       CREATE COLLATION (CREATE_COLLATION(7)), DROP COLLATION
       (DROP_COLLATION(7))
