NAME
       Net::LDAP::Extension::SetPassword - LDAPv3 Modify Password extension
       object

SYNOPSIS
	use Net::LDAP;
	use Net::LDAP::Extension::SetPassword;

	$ldap = Net::LDAP-&gtnew( "ldap.mydomain.eg" );

	$ldap-&gtbind('cn=Joe User,cn=People,dc=mydomain,dc=eg",
		    password =&gt 'oldPassword');

	$mesg = $ldap-&gtset_password( oldpasswd =&gt 'oldPassword' );

	die "error: ", $mesg-&gtcode(), ": ", $mesg-&gterror()  if ($mesg-&gtcode());

	print "changed your password to", $mesg-&gtgen_password() , "\n";

DESCRIPTION
       "Net::LDAP::Extension::SetPassword" implements the "Modify Password"
       extended LDAPv3 operation as described in RFC 3062.

       It implements no object by itself but extends the Net::LDAP object by
       another method:

METHODS
       set_password ( OPTIONS )
	   Set the password for a user.

	   OPTIONS is a list of key/value pairs. The following keys are
	   recognized:

	   user
	       If present, this option contains the octet string
	       representation of the user associated with the request.
	       Depending on how users are identified in the directory this
	       string may or may not be a DN according to RFC 2253.

	       If this option is not present, the request acts up upon the
	       password of the user currently associated with the LDAP
	       session.

	   oldpasswd
	       This option, if present, must contain the current password of
	       the user for whom this operation is performed.

	       It depends on the server's implementation in which cirumstances
	       this option is allowed to be missing.

	   newpasswd
	       If present, this option contains the desired password for the
	       user for whom the operation is performed.

	       Depending on the server's implementation this option may be
	       required by the LDAP server.

       gen_password ( )
	   Return the password generated by the server in response to the
	   "set_password()" call when applicable. The server will not generate
	   a new password if "newpasswd" was passed to "set_password()".

	   This method is a method of the Net::LDAP::Message response object
	   returned in reply to "set_password()" in case the "set_password()"
	   call succeeded.

	   By this method the caller can query for the value of the password
	   in case he did not call "set_password()" with the "newpasswd"
	   option.
