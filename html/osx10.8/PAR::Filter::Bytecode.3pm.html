NAME
       PAR::Filter::Bytecode - Bytecode filter

SYNOPSIS
	   PAR::Filter::Bytecode-&gtapply(\$code); # transforms $code

DESCRIPTION
       This filter is deprecated. The B::Bytecode code has been removed from
       the newest development series of perl and will not be included in perl
       5.10 any more. Please have a look at Steve Hay's PAR::Filter::Crypto
       module if you want to hide your sources.

       This filter uses B::Bytecode to turn the script into comment-free,
       architecture-specific Perl bytecode, and uses ByteLoader to load back
       on execution.

       For pp users, please add an extra -M option, like this:

	   pp -f Bytecode -M ByteLoader

       Otherwise, the implicit dependency on ByteLoader will not be detected.

CAVEATS
       This backend exhibits all bugs listed in B::Bytecode, and then some.

       Bytecode support is considered to be extremely fragile on Perl versions
       earlier than 5.8.1, and is still far from robust (as of this writing).

       Bytecode is not supported by perl 5.9 and later.
