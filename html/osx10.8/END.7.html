NAME
       END - commit the current transaction

SYNOPSIS
       END [ WORK | TRANSACTION ]

DESCRIPTION
       END commits the current transaction. All changes made by the
       transaction become visible to others and are guaranteed to be durable
       if a crash occurs. This command is a PostgreSQL extension that is
       equivalent to COMMIT(7).

PARAMETERS
       WORK, TRANSACTION
	   Optional key words. They have no effect.

NOTES
       Use ROLLBACK(7) to abort a transaction.

       Issuing END when not inside a transaction does no harm, but it will
       provoke a warning message.

EXAMPLES
       To commit the current transaction and make all changes permanent:

	   END;

COMPATIBILITY
       END is a PostgreSQL extension that provides functionality equivalent to
       COMMIT(7), which is specified in the SQL standard.

SEE ALSO
       BEGIN(7), COMMIT(7), ROLLBACK(7)
