NAME
       ModuleInfo - Gather package and POD information from a perl module file

DESCRIPTION
       new_from_file($filename, collect_pod => 1)
	   Construct a "ModuleInfo" object given the path to a file. Takes an
	   optional argument "collect_pod" which is a boolean that determines
	   whether POD data is collected and stored for reference. POD data is
	   not collected by default. POD headings are always collected.

       new_from_module($module, collect_pod => 1, inc => \@dirs)
	   Construct a "ModuleInfo" object given a module or package name. In
	   addition to accepting the "collect_pod" argument as described
	   above, this method accepts a "inc" argument which is a reference to
	   an array of of directories to search for the module. If none are
	   given, the default is @INC.

       name()
	   Returns the name of the package represented by this module. If
	   there are more than one packages, it makes a best guess based on
	   the filename. If it's a script (i.e. not a *.pm) the package name
	   is 'main'.

       version($package)
	   Returns the version as defined by the $VERSION variable for the
	   package as returned by the "name" method if no arguments are given.
	   If given the name of a package it will attempt to return the
	   version of that package if it is specified in the file.

       filename()
	   Returns the absolute path to the file.

       packages_inside()
	   Returns a list of packages.

       pod_inside()
	   Returns a list of POD sections.

       contains_pod()
	   Returns true if there is any POD in the file.

       pod($section)
	   Returns the POD data in the given section.

       find_module_by_name($module, \@dirs)
	   Returns the path to a module given the module or package name. A
	   list of directories can be passed in as an optional parameter,
	   otherwise @INC is searched.

	   Can be called as either an object or a class method.

       find_module_dir_by_name($module, \@dirs)
	   Returns the entry in @dirs (or @INC by default) that contains the
	   module $module. A list of directories can be passed in as an
	   optional parameter, otherwise @INC is searched.

	   Can be called as either an object or a class method.
