NAME
       Pod::Man - Convert POD data to formatted *roff input

SYNOPSIS
	   use Pod::Man;
	   my $parser = Pod::Man-&gtnew (release =&gt $VERSION, section =&gt 8);

	   # Read POD from STDIN and write to STDOUT.
	   $parser-&gtparse_file (\*STDIN);

	   # Read POD from file.pod and write to file.1.
	   $parser-&gtparse_from_file ('file.pod', 'file.1');

DESCRIPTION
       Pod::Man is a module to convert documentation in the POD format (the
       preferred language for documenting Perl) into *roff input using the man
       macro set.  The resulting *roff code is suitable for display on a
       terminal using nroff(1), normally via man(1), or printing using
       troff(1).  It is conventionally invoked using the driver script
       pod2man, but it can also be used directly.

       As a derived class from Pod::Simple, Pod::Man supports the same methods
       and interfaces.	See Pod::Simple for all the details.

       new() can take options, in the form of key/value pairs that control the
       behavior of the parser.	See below for details.

       If no options are given, Pod::Man uses the name of the input file with
       any trailing ".pod", ".pm", or ".pl" stripped as the man page title, to
       section 1 unless the file ended in ".pm" in which case it defaults to
       section 3, to a centered title of "User Contributed Perl
       Documentation", to a centered footer of the Perl version it is run
       with, and to a left-hand footer of the modification date of its input
       (or the current date if given "STDIN" for input).

       Pod::Man assumes that your *roff formatters have a fixed-width font
       named "CW".  If yours is called something else (like "CR"), use the
       "fixed" option to specify it.  This generally only matters for troff
       output for printing.  Similarly, you can set the fonts used for bold,
       italic, and bold italic fixed-width output.

       Besides the obvious pod conversions, Pod::Man also takes care of
       formatting func(), func(3), and simple variable references like $foo or
       @bar so you don't have to use code escapes for them; complex
       expressions like $fred{'stuff'} will still need to be escaped, though.
       It also translates dashes that aren't used as hyphens into en dashes,
       makes long dashes--like this--into proper em dashes, fixes "paired
       quotes," makes C++ look right, puts a little space between double
       underscores, makes ALLCAPS a teeny bit smaller in troff, and escapes
       stuff that *roff treats as special so that you don't have to.

       The recognized options to new() are as follows.	All options take a
       single argument.

       center
	   Sets the centered page header to use instead of "User Contributed
	   Perl Documentation".

       date
	   Sets the left-hand footer.  By default, the modification date of
	   the input file will be used, or the current date if stat() can't
	   find that file (the case if the input is from "STDIN"), and the
	   date will be formatted as "YYYY-MM-DD".

       fixed
	   The fixed-width font to use for verbatim text and code.  Defaults
	   to "CW".  Some systems may want "CR" instead.  Only matters for
	   troff output.

       fixedbold
	   Bold version of the fixed-width font.  Defaults to "CB".  Only
	   matters for troff output.

       fixeditalic
	   Italic version of the fixed-width font (actually, something of a
	   misnomer, since most fixed-width fonts only have an oblique
	   version, not an italic version).  Defaults to "CI".	Only matters
	   for troff output.

       fixedbolditalic
	   Bold italic (probably actually oblique) version of the fixed-width
	   font.  Pod::Man doesn't assume you have this, and defaults to "CB".
	   Some systems (such as Solaris) have this font available as "CX".
	   Only matters for troff output.

       name
	   Set the name of the manual page.  Without this option, the manual
	   name is set to the uppercased base name of the file being converted
	   unless the manual section is 3, in which case the path is parsed to
	   see if it is a Perl module path.  If it is, a path like
	   ".../lib/Pod/Man.pm" is converted into a name like "Pod::Man".
	   This option, if given, overrides any automatic determination of the
	   name.

       quotes
	   Sets the quote marks used to surround C&lt&gt text.  If the value is a
	   single character, it is used as both the left and right quote; if
	   it is two characters, the first character is used as the left quote
	   and the second as the right quoted; and if it is four characters,
	   the first two are used as the left quote and the second two as the
	   right quote.

	   This may also be set to the special value "none", in which case no
	   quote marks are added around C&lt&gt text (but the font is still
	   changed for troff output).

       release
	   Set the centered footer.  By default, this is the version of Perl
	   you run Pod::Man under.  Note that some system an macro sets assume
	   that the centered footer will be a modification date and will
	   prepend something like "Last modified: "; if this is the case, you
	   may want to set "release" to the last modified date and "date" to
	   the version number.

       section
	   Set the section for the ".TH" macro.  The standard section
	   numbering convention is to use 1 for user commands, 2 for system
	   calls, 3 for functions, 4 for devices, 5 for file formats, 6 for
	   games, 7 for miscellaneous information, and 8 for administrator
	   commands.  There is a lot of variation here, however; some systems
	   (like Solaris) use 4 for file formats, 5 for miscellaneous
	   information, and 7 for devices.  Still others use 1m instead of 8,
	   or some mix of both.  About the only section numbers that are
	   reliably consistent are 1, 2, and 3.

	   By default, section 1 will be used unless the file ends in ".pm" in
	   which case section 3 will be selected.

       stderr
	   Send error messages about invalid POD to standard error instead of
	   appending a POD ERRORS section to the generated *roff output.

       utf8
	   By default, Pod::Man produces the most conservative possible *roff
	   output to try to ensure that it will work with as many different
	   *roff implementations as possible.  Many *roff implementations
	   cannot handle non-ASCII characters, so this means all non-ASCII
	   characters are converted either to a *roff escape sequence that
	   tries to create a properly accented character (at least for troff
	   output) or to "X".

	   If this option is set, Pod::Man will instead output UTF-8.  If your
	   *roff implementation can handle it, this is the best output format
	   to use and avoids corruption of documents containing non-ASCII
	   characters.	However, be warned that *roff source with literal
	   UTF-8 characters is not supported by many implementations and may
	   even result in segfaults and other bad behavior.

	   Be aware that, when using this option, the input encoding of your
	   POD source must be properly declared unless it is US-ASCII or
	   Latin-1.  POD input without an "=encoding" command will be assumed
	   to be in Latin-1, and if it's actually in UTF-8, the output will be
	   double-encoded.  See perlpod(1) for more information on the
	   "=encoding" command.

       The standard Pod::Simple method parse_file() takes one argument naming
       the POD file to read from.  By default, the output is sent to "STDOUT",
       but this can be changed with the output_fd() method.

       The standard Pod::Simple method parse_from_file() takes up to two
       arguments, the first being the input file to read POD from and the
       second being the file to write the formatted output to.

       You can also call parse_lines() to parse an array of lines or
       parse_string_document() to parse a document already in memory.  To put
       the output into a string instead of a file handle, call the
       output_string() method.	See Pod::Simple for the specific details.

DIAGNOSTICS
       roff font should be 1 or 2 chars, not "%s"
	   (F) You specified a *roff font (using "fixed", "fixedbold", etc.)
	   that wasn't either one or two characters.  Pod::Man doesn't support
	   *roff fonts longer than two characters, although some *roff
	   extensions do (the canonical versions of nroff and troff don't
	   either).

       Invalid quote specification "%s"
	   (F) The quote specification given (the quotes option to the
	   constructor) was invalid.  A quote specification must be one, two,
	   or four characters long.

BUGS
       Encoding handling assumes that PerlIO is available and does not work
       properly if it isn't.  The "utf8" option is therefore not supported
       unless Perl is built with PerlIO support.

       There is currently no way to turn off the guesswork that tries to
       format unmarked text appropriately, and sometimes it isn't wanted
       (particularly when using POD to document something other than Perl).
       Most of the work toward fixing this has now been done, however, and all
       that's still needed is a user interface.

       The NAME section should be recognized specially and index entries
       emitted for everything in that section.	This would have to be deferred
       until the next section, since extraneous things in NAME tends to
       confuse various man page processors.  Currently, no index entries are
       emitted for anything in NAME.

       Pod::Man doesn't handle font names longer than two characters.  Neither
       do most troff implementations, but GNU troff does as an extension.  It
       would be nice to support as an option for those who want to use it.

       The preamble added to each output file is rather verbose, and most of
       it is only necessary in the presence of non-ASCII characters.  It would
       ideally be nice if all of those definitions were only output if needed,
       perhaps on the fly as the characters are used.

       Pod::Man is excessively slow.

CAVEATS
       If Pod::Man is given the "utf8" option, the encoding of its output file
       handle will be forced to UTF-8 if possible, overriding any existing
       encoding.  This will be done even if the file handle is not created by
       Pod::Man and was passed in from outside.  This maintains consistency
       regardless of PERL_UNICODE and other settings.

       The handling of hyphens and em dashes is somewhat fragile, and one may
       get the wrong one under some circumstances.  This should only matter
       for troff output.

       When and whether to use small caps is somewhat tricky, and Pod::Man
       doesn't necessarily get it right.

       Converting neutral double quotes to properly matched double quotes
       doesn't work unless there are no formatting codes between the quote
       marks.  This only matters for troff output.
