NAME
       glGetActiveUniformBlockName - retrieve the name of an active uniform
       block

C SPECIFICATION
       void glGetActiveUniformBlockName(GLuint program,
					GLuint uniformBlockIndex,
					GLsizei bufSize, GLsizei *length,
					GLchar *uniformBlockName);

PARAMETERS
       program
	   Specifies the name of a program containing the uniform block.

       uniformBlockIndex
	   Specifies the index of the uniform block within program.

       bufSize
	   Specifies the size of the buffer addressed by uniformBlockName.

       length
	   Specifies the address of a variable to receive the number of
	   characters that were written to uniformBlockName.

       uniformBlockName
	   Specifies the address an array of characters to receive the name of
	   the uniform block at uniformBlockIndex.

DESCRIPTION
       glGetActiveUniformBlockName retrieves the name of the active uniform
       block at uniformBlockIndex within program.


       program must be the name of a program object for which the command
       glLinkProgram() must have been called in the past, although it is not
       required that glLinkProgram() must have succeeded. The link could have
       failed because the number of active uniforms exceeded the limit.


       uniformBlockIndex is an active uniform block index of program, and must
       be less than the value of GL_ACTIVE_UNIFORM_BLOCKS.

       Upon success, the name of the uniform block identified by
       unifomBlockIndex is returned into uniformBlockName. The name is
       nul-terminated. The actual number of characters written into
       uniformBlockName, excluding the nul terminator, is returned in length.
       If length is NULL, no length is returned.


       bufSize contains the maximum number of characters (including the nul
       terminator) that will be written into uniformBlockName.

       If an error occurs, nothing will be written to uniformBlockName or
       length.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if program is not the name of a
       program object for which glLinkProgram() has been called in the past.


       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if uniformBlockIndex is greater than or
       equal to the value of GL_ACTIVE_UNIFORM_BLOCKS or is not the index of
       an active uniform block in program.

NOTES
       glGetActiveUniformBlockName is available only if the GL version is 3.1
       or greater.
