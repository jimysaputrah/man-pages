NAME
       version::Internals - Perl extension for Version Objects

DESCRIPTION
       Overloaded version objects for all modern versions of Perl.  This
       documents the internal data representation and underlying code for
       version.pm.  See version.pod for daily usage.  This document is only
       useful for users interested in the gory details.

WHAT IS A VERSION?
       For the purposes of this module, a version "number" is a sequence of
       positive integer values separated by one or more decimal points and
       optionally a single underscore.	This corresponds to what Perl itself
       uses for a version, as well as extending the "version as number" that
       is discussed in the various editions of the Camel book.

       There are actually two distinct kinds of version objects:

       Decimal Versions
	   Any version which "looks like a number", see "Decimal Versions".
	   This also includes versions with a single decimal point and a
	   single embedded underscore, see "Alpha Versions", even though these
	   must be quoted to preserve the underscore formatting.

       Dotted-Decimal Versions
	   Also referred to as "Dotted-Integer", these contains more than one
	   decimal point and may have an optional embedded underscore, see
	   Dotted-Decimal Versions.  This is what is commonly used in most
	   open source software as the "external" version (the one used as
	   part of the tag or tarfile name).  A leading 'v' character is now
	   required and will warn if it missing.

       Both of these methods will produce similar version objects, in that the
       default stringification will yield the version "Normal Form" only if
       required:

	 $v  = version-&gtnew(1.002);	# 1.002, but compares like 1.2.0
	 $v  = version-&gtnew(1.002003);	# 1.002003
	 $v2 = version-&gtnew("v1.2.3");	# v1.2.3

       In specific, version numbers initialized as "Decimal Versions" will
       stringify as they were originally created (i.e. the same string that
       was passed to "new()".  Version numbers initialized as "Dotted-Decimal
       Versions" will be stringified as "Normal Form".

   Decimal Versions
       These correspond to historical versions of Perl itself prior to 5.6.0,
       as well as all other modules which follow the Camel rules for the
       $VERSION scalar.  A Decimal version is initialized with what looks like
       a floating point number.  Leading zeros are significant and trailing
       zeros are implied so that a minimum of three places is maintained
       between subversions.  What this means is that any subversion (digits to
       the right of the decimal place) that contains less than three digits
       will have trailing zeros added to make up the difference, but only for
       purposes of comparison with other version objects.  For example:

					  # Prints     Equivalent to
	 $v = version-&gtnew(	 1.2);	  # 1.2        v1.200.0
	 $v = version-&gtnew(	1.02);	  # 1.02       v1.20.0
	 $v = version-&gtnew(    1.002);	  # 1.002      v1.2.0
	 $v = version-&gtnew(   1.0023);	  # 1.0023     v1.2.300
	 $v = version-&gtnew(  1.00203);	  # 1.00203    v1.2.30
	 $v = version-&gtnew( 1.002003);	  # 1.002003   v1.2.3

       All of the preceding examples are true whether or not the input value
       is quoted.  The important feature is that the input value contains only
       a single decimal.  See also "Alpha Versions".

       IMPORTANT NOTE: As shown above, if your Decimal version contains more
       than 3 significant digits after the decimal place, it will be split on
       each multiple of 3, so 1.0003 is equivalent to v1.0.300, due to the
       need to remain compatible with Perl's own 5.005_03 == 5.5.30
       interpretation.	Any trailing zeros are ignored for mathematical
       comparison purposes.

   Dotted-Decimal Versions
       These are the newest form of versions, and correspond to Perl's own
       version style beginning with 5.6.0.  Starting with Perl 5.10.0, and
       most likely Perl 6, this is likely to be the preferred form.  This
       method normally requires that the input parameter be quoted, although
       Perl's after 5.8.1 can use v-strings as a special form of quoting, but
       this is highly discouraged.

       Unlike "Decimal Versions", Dotted-Decimal Versions have more than a
       single decimal point, e.g.:

					  # Prints
	 $v = version-&gtnew( "v1.200");	  # v1.200.0
	 $v = version-&gtnew("v1.20.0");	  # v1.20.0
	 $v = qv("v1.2.3");		  # v1.2.3
	 $v = qv("1.2.3");		  # v1.2.3
	 $v = qv("1.20");		  # v1.20.0

       In general, Dotted-Decimal Versions permit the greatest amount of
       freedom to specify a version, whereas Decimal Versions enforce a
       certain uniformity.

       Just like "Decimal Versions", Dotted-Decimal Versions can be used as
       "Alpha Versions".

   Alpha Versions
       For module authors using CPAN, the convention has been to note unstable
       releases with an underscore in the version string. (See CPAN.)
       version.pm follows this convention and alpha releases will test as
       being newer than the more recent stable release, and less than the next
       stable release.	Only the last element may be separated by an
       underscore:

	 # Declaring
	 use version 0.77; our $VERSION = version-&gtdeclare("v1.2_3");

	 # Parsing
	 $v1 = version-&gtparse("v1.2_3");
	 $v1 = version-&gtparse("1.002_003");

       Note that you must quote the version when writing an alpha Decimal
       version.  The stringified form of Decimal versions will always be the
       same string that was used to initialize the version object.

   Regular Expressions for Version Parsing
       A formalized definition of the legal forms for version strings is
       included in the main version.pm file.  Primitives are included for
       common elements, although they are scoped to the file so they are
       useful for reference purposes only.  There are two publicly accessible
       scalars that can be used in other code (not exported):

       $version::LAX
	   This regexp covers all of the legal forms allowed under the current
	   version string parser.  This is not to say that all of these forms
	   are recommended, and some of them can only be used when quoted.

	   For dotted decimals:

	       v1.2
	       1.2345.6
	       v1.23_4

	   The leading 'v' is optional if two or more decimals appear.	If
	   only a single decimal is included, then the leading 'v' is required
	   to trigger the dotted-decimal parsing.  A leading zero is
	   permitted, though not recommended except when quoted, because of
	   the risk that Perl will treat the number as octal.  A trailing
	   underscore plus one or more digits denotes an alpha or development
	   release (and must be quoted to be parsed properly).

	   For decimal versions:

	       1
	       1.2345
	       1.2345_01

	   an integer portion, an optional decimal point, and optionally one
	   or more digits to the right of the decimal are all required.  A
	   trailing underscore is permitted and a leading zero is permitted.
	   Just like the lax dotted-decimal version, quoting the values is
	   required for alpha/development forms to be parsed correctly.

       $version::STRICT
	   This regexp covers a much more limited set of formats and
	   constitutes the best practices for initializing version objects.
	   Whether you choose to employ decimal or dotted-decimal for is a
	   personal preference however.

	   v1.234.5
	       For dotted-decimal versions, a leading 'v' is required, with
	       three or more sub-versions of no more than three digits.  A
	       leading 0 (zero) before the first sub-version (in the above
	       example, '1') is also prohibited.

	   2.3456
	       For decimal versions, an integer portion (no leading 0), a
	       decimal point, and one or more digits to the right of the
	       decimal are all required.

       Both of the provided scalars are already compiled as regular
       expressions and do not contain either anchors or implicit groupings, so
       they can be included in your own regular expressions freely.  For
       example, consider the following code:

	       ($pkg, $ver) =~ /
		       ^[ \t]*
		       use [ \t]+($PKGNAME)
		       (?:[ \t]+($version::STRICT))?
		       [ \t]*;
	       /x;

       This would match a line of the form:

	       use Foo::Bar::Baz v1.2.3;       # legal only in Perl 5.8.1+

       where $PKGNAME is another regular expression that defines the legal
       forms for package names.

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
   Equivalence between Decimal and Dotted-Decimal Versions
       When Perl 5.6.0 was released, the decision was made to provide a
       transformation between the old-style decimal versions and new-style
       dotted-decimal versions:

	 5.6.0	  == 5.006000
	 5.005_04 == 5.5.40

       The floating point number is taken and split first on the single
       decimal place, then each group of three digits to the right of the
       decimal makes up the next digit, and so on until the number of
       significant digits is exhausted, plus enough trailing zeros to reach
       the next multiple of three.

       This was the method that version.pm adopted as well.  Some examples may
       be helpful:

				   equivalent
	 decimal    zero-padded    dotted-decimal
	 -------    -----------    --------------
	 1.2	    1.200	   v1.200.0
	 1.02	    1.020	   v1.20.0
	 1.002	    1.002	   v1.2.0
	 1.0023     1.002300	   v1.2.300
	 1.00203    1.002030	   v1.2.30
	 1.002003   1.002003	   v1.2.3

   Quoting Rules
       Because of the nature of the Perl parsing and tokenizing routines,
       certain initialization values must be quoted in order to correctly
       parse as the intended version, especially when using the declare or qv
       methods.  While you do not have to quote decimal numbers when creating
       version objects, it is always safe to quote all initial values when
       using version.pm methods, as this will ensure that what you type is
       what is used.

       Additionally, if you quote your initializer, then the quoted value that
       goes in will be be exactly what comes out when your $VERSION is printed
       (stringified).  If you do not quote your value, Perl's normal numeric
       handling comes into play and you may not get back what you were
       expecting.

       If you use a mathematic formula that resolves to a floating point
       number, you are dependent on Perl's conversion routines to yield the
       version you expect.  You are pretty safe by dividing by a power of 10,
       for example, but other operations are not likely to be what you intend.
       For example:

	 $VERSION = version-&gtnew((qw$Revision: 1.4)[1]/10);
	 print $VERSION;	  # yields 0.14
	 $V2 = version-&gtnew(100/9); # Integer overflow in decimal number
	 print $V2;		  # yields something like 11.111.111.100

       Perl 5.8.1 and beyond are able to automatically quote v-strings but
       that is not possible in earlier versions of Perl.  In other words:

	 $version = version-&gtnew("v2.5.4");  # legal in all versions of Perl
	 $newvers = version-&gtnew(v2.5.4);    # legal only in Perl &gt= 5.8.1

   What about v-strings?
       There are two ways to enter v-strings: a bare number with two or more
       decimal points, or a bare number with one or more decimal points and a
       leading 'v' character (also bare).  For example:

	 $vs1 = 1.2.3; # encoded as \1\2\3
	 $vs2 = v1.2;  # encoded as \1\2

       However, the use of bare v-strings to initialize version objects is
       strongly discouraged in all circumstances.  Also, bare v-strings are
       not completely supported in any version of Perl prior to 5.8.1.

       If you insist on using bare v-strings with Perl &gt 5.6.0, be aware of
       the following limitations:

       1) For Perl releases 5.6.0 through 5.8.0, the v-string code merely
       guesses, based on some characteristics of v-strings.  You must use a
       three part version, e.g. 1.2.3 or v1.2.3 in order for this heuristic to
       be successful.

       2) For Perl releases 5.8.1 and later, v-strings have changed in the
       Perl core to be magical, which means that the version.pm code can
       automatically determine whether the v-string encoding was used.

       3) In all cases, a version created using v-strings will have a
       stringified form that has a leading 'v' character, for the simple
       reason that sometimes it is impossible to tell whether one was present
       initially.

   Version Object Internals
       version.pm provides an overloaded version object that is designed to
       both encapsulate the author's intended $VERSION assignment as well as
       make it completely natural to use those objects as if they were numbers
       (e.g. for comparisons).	To do this, a version object contains both the
       original representation as typed by the author, as well as a parsed
       representation to ease comparisons.  Version objects employ overload
       methods to simplify code that needs to compare, print, etc the objects.

       The internal structure of version objects is a blessed hash with
       several components:

	   bless( {
	     'original' =&gt 'v1.2.3_4',
	     'alpha' =&gt 1,
	     'qv' =&gt 1,
	     'version' =&gt [
	       1,
	       2,
	       3,
	       4
	     ]
	   }, 'version' );

       original
	   A faithful representation of the value used to initialize this
	   version object.  The only time this will not be precisely the same
	   characters that exist in the source file is if a short dotted-
	   decimal version like v1.2 was used (in which case it will contain
	   'v1.2').  This form is STRONGLY discouraged, in that it will
	   confuse you and your users.

       qv  A boolean that denotes whether this is a decimal or dotted-decimal
	   version.  See is_qv.

       alpha
	   A boolean that denotes whether this is an alpha version.  NOTE:
	   that the underscore can can only appear in the last position.  See
	   is_alpha.

       version
	   An array of non-negative integers that is used for comparison
	   purposes with other version objects.

   Replacement UNIVERSAL::VERSION
       In addition to the version objects, this modules also replaces the core
       UNIVERSAL::VERSION function with one that uses version objects for its
       comparisons.  The return from this operator is always the stringified
       form as a simple scalar (i.e. not an object), but the warning message
       generated includes either the stringified form or the normal form,
       depending on how it was called.

       For example:

	 package Foo;
	 $VERSION = 1.2;

	 package Bar;
	 $VERSION = "v1.3.5"; # works with all Perl's (since it is quoted)

	 package main;
	 use version;

	 print $Foo::VERSION; # prints 1.2

	 print $Bar::VERSION; # prints 1.003005

	 eval "use foo 10";
	 print $@; # prints "foo version 10 required..."
	 eval "use foo 1.3.5; # work in Perl 5.6.1 or better
	 print $@; # prints "foo version 1.3.5 required..."

	 eval "use bar 1.3.6";
	 print $@; # prints "bar version 1.3.6 required..."
	 eval "use bar 1.004"; # note Decimal version
	 print $@; # prints "bar version 1.004 required..."

       IMPORTANT NOTE: This may mean that code which searches for a specific
       string (to determine whether a given module is available) may need to
       be changed.  It is always better to use the built-in comparison
       implicit in "use" or "require", rather than manually poking at
       "class-&gtVERSION" and then doing a comparison yourself.

       The replacement UNIVERSAL::VERSION, when used as a function, like this:

	 print $module-&gtVERSION;

       will also exclusively return the stringified form.  See Stringification
       for more details.

USAGE DETAILS
   Using modules that use version.pm
       As much as possible, the version.pm module remains compatible with all
       current code.  However, if your module is using a module that has
       defined $VERSION using the version class, there are a couple of things
       to be aware of.	For purposes of discussion, we will assume that we
       have the following module installed:

	 package Example;
	 use version;  $VERSION = qv('1.2.2');
	 ...module code here...
	 1;

       Decimal versions always work
	   Code of the form:

	     use Example 1.002003;

	   will always work correctly.	The "use" will perform an automatic
	   $VERSION comparison using the floating point number given as the
	   first term after the module name (e.g. above 1.002.003).  In this
	   case, the installed module is too old for the requested line, so
	   you would see an error like:

	     Example version 1.002003 (v1.2.3) required--this is only version 1.002002 (v1.2.2)...

       Dotted-Decimal version work sometimes
	   With Perl &gt= 5.6.2, you can also use a line like this:

	     use Example 1.2.3;

	   and it will again work (i.e. give the error message as above), even
	   with releases of Perl which do not normally support v-strings (see
	   "What about v-strings" in version below).  This has to do with that
	   fact that "use" only checks to see if the second term looks like a
	   number and passes that to the replacement UNIVERSAL::VERSION.  This
	   is not true in Perl 5.005_04, however, so you are strongly
	   encouraged to always use a Decimal version in your code, even for
	   those versions of Perl which support the Dotted-Decimal version.

   Object Methods
       new()
	   Like many OO interfaces, the new() method is used to initialize
	   version objects.  If two arguments are passed to "new()", the
	   second one will be used as if it were prefixed with "v".  This is
	   to support historical use of the "qw" operator with the CVS
	   variable $Revision, which is automatically incremented by CVS every
	   time the file is committed to the repository.

	   In order to facilitate this feature, the following code can be
	   employed:

	     $VERSION = version-&gtnew(qw$Revision: 2.7 $);

	   and the version object will be created as if the following code
	   were used:

	     $VERSION = version-&gtnew("v2.7");

	   In other words, the version will be automatically parsed out of the
	   string, and it will be quoted to preserve the meaning CVS normally
	   carries for versions.  The CVS $Revision$ increments differently
	   from Decimal versions (i.e. 1.10 follows 1.9), so it must be
	   handled as if it were a Dotted-Decimal Version.

	   A new version object can be created as a copy of an existing
	   version object, either as a class method:

	     $v1 = version-&gtnew(12.3);
	     $v2 = version-&gtnew($v1);

	   or as an object method:

	     $v1 = version-&gtnew(12.3);
	     $v2 = $v1-&gtnew(12.3);

	   and in each case, $v1 and $v2 will be identical.  NOTE: if you
	   create a new object using an existing object like this:

	     $v2 = $v1-&gtnew();

	   the new object will not be a clone of the existing object.  In the
	   example case, $v2 will be an empty object of the same type as $v1.

       qv()
	   An alternate way to create a new version object is through the
	   exported qv() sub.  This is not strictly like other q? operators
	   (like qq, qw), in that the only delimiters supported are
	   parentheses (or spaces).  It is the best way to initialize a short
	   version without triggering the floating point interpretation.  For
	   example:

	     $v1 = qv(1.2);	    # v1.2.0
	     $v2 = qv("1.2");	    # also v1.2.0

	   As you can see, either a bare number or a quoted string can usually
	   be used interchangably, except in the case of a trailing zero,
	   which must be quoted to be converted properly.  For this reason, it
	   is strongly recommended that all initializers to qv() be quoted
	   strings instead of bare numbers.

	   To prevent the "qv()" function from being exported to the caller's
	   namespace, either use version with a null parameter:

	     use version ();

	   or just require version, like this:

	     require version;

	   Both methods will prevent the import() method from firing and
	   exporting the "qv()" sub.

       For the subsequent examples, the following three objects will be used:

	 $ver	= version-&gtnew("1.2.3.4"); # see "Quoting Rules"
	 $alpha = version-&gtnew("1.2.3_4"); # see "Alpha Versions"
	 $nver	= version-&gtnew(1.002);	   # see "Decimal Versions"

       Normal Form
	   For any version object which is initialized with multiple decimal
	   places (either quoted or if possible v-string), or initialized
	   using the qv() operator, the stringified representation is returned
	   in a normalized or reduced form (no extraneous zeros), and with a
	   leading 'v':

	     print $ver-&gtnormal;	 # prints as v1.2.3.4
	     print $ver-&gtstringify;	 # ditto
	     print $ver;		 # ditto
	     print $nver-&gtnormal;	 # prints as v1.2.0
	     print $nver-&gtstringify;	 # prints as 1.002, see "Stringification"

	   In order to preserve the meaning of the processed version, the
	   normalized representation will always contain at least three sub
	   terms.  In other words, the following is guaranteed to always be
	   true:

	     my $newver = version-&gtnew($ver-&gtstringify);
	     if ($newver eq $ver ) # always true
	       {...}

       Numification
	   Although all mathematical operations on version objects are
	   forbidden by default, it is possible to retrieve a number which
	   corresponds to the version object through the use of the
	   $obj-&gtnumify method.  For formatting purposes, when displaying a
	   number which corresponds a version object, all sub versions are
	   assumed to have three decimal places.  So for example:

	     print $ver-&gtnumify;	 # prints 1.002003004
	     print $nver-&gtnumify;	 # prints 1.002

	   Unlike the stringification operator, there is never any need to
	   append trailing zeros to preserve the correct version value.

       Stringification
	   The default stringification for version objects returns exactly the
	   same string as was used to create it, whether you used "new()" or
	   "qv()", with one exception.	The sole exception is if the object
	   was created using "qv()" and the initializer did not have two
	   decimal places or a leading 'v' (both optional), then the
	   stringified form will have a leading 'v' prepended, in order to
	   support round-trip processing.

	   For example:

	     Initialized as	     Stringifies to
	     ==============	     ==============
	     version-&gtnew("1.2")       1.2
	     version-&gtnew("v1.2")     v1.2
	     qv("1.2.3")	       1.2.3
	     qv("v1.3.5")	      v1.3.5
	     qv("1.2")		      v1.2   ### exceptional case

	   See also UNIVERSAL::VERSION, as this also returns the stringified
	   form when used as a class method.

	   IMPORTANT NOTE: There is one exceptional cases shown in the above
	   table where the "initializer" is not stringwise equivalent to the
	   stringified representation.	If you use the "qv"() operator on a
	   version without a leading 'v' and with only a single decimal place,
	   the stringified output will have a leading 'v', to preserve the
	   sense.  See the qv() operator for more details.

	   IMPORTANT NOTE 2: Attempting to bypass the normal stringification
	   rules by manually applying numify() and normal() will sometimes
	   yield surprising results:

	     print version-&gtnew(version-&gtnew("v1.0")-&gtnumify)-&gtnormal; # v1.0.0

	   The reason for this is that the numify() operator will turn "v1.0"
	   into the equivalent string "1.000000".  Forcing the outer version
	   object to normal() form will display the mathematically equivalent
	   "v1.0.0".

	   As the example in new() shows, you can always create a copy of an
	   existing version object with the same value by the very compact:

	     $v2 = $v1-&gtnew($v1);

	   and be assured that both $v1 and $v2 will be completely equivalent,
	   down to the same internal representation as well as
	   stringification.

       Comparison operators
	   Both "cmp" and "&lt=&gt" operators perform the same comparison between
	   terms (upgrading to a version object automatically).  Perl
	   automatically generates all of the other comparison operators based
	   on those two.  In addition to the obvious equalities listed below,
	   appending a single trailing 0 term does not change the value of a
	   version for comparison purposes.  In other words "v1.2" and "1.2.0"
	   will compare as identical.

	   For example, the following relations hold:

	     As Number	      As String 	  Truth Value
	     -------------    ----------------	  -----------
	     $ver &gt  1.0      $ver gt "1.0"	  true
	     $ver &lt  2.5      $ver lt		  true
	     $ver != 1.3      $ver ne "1.3"	  true
	     $ver == 1.2      $ver eq "1.2"	  false
	     $ver == 1.2.3.4  $ver eq "1.2.3.4"   see discussion below

	   It is probably best to chose either the Decimal notation or the
	   string notation and stick with it, to reduce confusion.  Perl6
	   version objects may only support Decimal comparisons.  See also
	   "Quoting Rules".

	   WARNING: Comparing version with unequal numbers of decimal points
	   (whether explicitly or implicitly initialized), may yield
	   unexpected results at first glance.	For example, the following
	   inequalities hold:

	     version-&gtnew(0.96)     &gt version-&gtnew(0.95); # 0.960.0 &gt 0.950.0
	     version-&gtnew("0.96.1") &lt version-&gtnew(0.95); # 0.096.1 &lt 0.950.0

	   For this reason, it is best to use either exclusively "Decimal
	   Versions" or "Dotted-Decimal Versions" with multiple decimal
	   points.

       Logical Operators
	   If you need to test whether a version object has been initialized,
	   you can simply test it directly:

	     $vobj = version-&gtnew($something);
	     if ( $vobj )   # true only if $something was non-blank

	   You can also test whether a version object is an alpha version, for
	   example to prevent the use of some feature not present in the main
	   release:

	     $vobj = version-&gtnew("1.2_3"); # MUST QUOTE
	     ...later...
	     if ( $vobj-&gtis_alpha )	  # True
