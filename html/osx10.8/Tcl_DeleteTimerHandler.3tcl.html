NAME
       Tcl_CreateTimerHandler,	Tcl_DeleteTimerHandler - call a procedure at a
       given time

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lttcl.h&gt

       Tcl_TimerToken
       Tcl_CreateTimerHandler(milliseconds, proc, clientData)

       Tcl_DeleteTimerHandler(token)

ARGUMENTS
       int milliseconds (in)			 How many milliseconds to wait
						 before invoking proc.

       Tcl_TimerProc *proc (in) 		 Procedure   to  invoke  after
						 milliseconds have elapsed.

       ClientData clientData (in)		 Arbitrary one-word  value  to
						 pass to proc.

       Tcl_TimerToken token (in)		 Token	for previously created
						 timer	handler  (the	return
						 value from some previous call
						 to Tcl_CreateTimerHandler).

DESCRIPTION
       Tcl_CreateTimerHandler arranges for proc to be invoked at a  time  mil-
       liseconds  milliseconds	in  the  future.  The callback to proc will be
       made by Tcl_DoOneEvent, so Tcl_CreateTimerHandler  is  only  useful  in
       programs  that  dispatch  events  through Tcl_DoOneEvent or through Tcl
       commands such as vwait.	The call to proc may not be made at the  exact
       time  given  by	milliseconds:  it will be made at the next opportunity
       after that time.  For example, if Tcl_DoOneEvent is  not  called  until
       long  after  the time has elapsed, or if there are other pending events
       to process before the call to proc, then  the  call  to	proc  will  be
       delayed.

       Proc  should  have  arguments  and  return  value  that	match the type
       Tcl_TimerProc:
	      typedef void Tcl_TimerProc(ClientData clientData);
       The clientData parameter to proc is a copy of the  clientData  argument
       given  to  Tcl_CreateTimerHandler when the callback was created.  Typi-
       cally, clientData points to a data  structure  containing  application-
       specific information about what to do in proc.

       Tcl_DeleteTimerHandler  may  be	called	to delete a previously created
       timer handler.  It deletes the handler indicated by token  so  that  no
       call  to  proc  will  be  made;	if that handler no longer exists (e.g.
       because the time period has already elapsed and proc has  been  invoked
       then  Tcl_DeleteTimerHandler  does  nothing.   The  tokens  returned by
       Tcl_CreateTimerHandler never have a value of NULL, so if NULL is passed
       to Tcl_DeleteTimerHandler then the procedure does nothing.
