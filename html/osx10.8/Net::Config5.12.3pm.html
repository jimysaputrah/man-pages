Net::Config(3pm)       Perl Programmers Reference Guide       Net::Config(3pm)



NAME
       Net::Config - Local configuration data for libnet

SYNOPSYS
	   use Net::Config qw(%NetConfig);

DESCRIPTION
       "Net::Config" holds configuration data for the modules in the libnet
       distribution. During installation you will be asked for these values.

       The configuration data is held globally in a file in the perl
       installation tree, but a user may override any of these values by
       providing their own. This can be done by having a ".libnetrc" file in
       their home directory. This file should return a reference to a HASH
       containing the keys described below.  For example

	   # .libnetrc
	   {
	       nntp_hosts =&gt [ "my_preferred_host" ],
	       ph_hosts   =&gt [ "my_ph_server" ],
	   }
	   __END__

METHODS
       "Net::Config" defines the following methods. They are methods as they
       are invoked as class methods. This is because "Net::Config" inherits
       from "Net::LocalCfg" so you can override these methods if you want.

       requires_firewall HOST
	   Attempts to determine if a given host is outside your firewall.
	   Possible return values are.

	     -1  Cannot lookup hostname
	      0  Host is inside firewall (or there is no ftp_firewall entry)
	      1  Host is outside the firewall

	   This is done by using hostname lookup and the "local_netmask" entry
	   in the configuration data.

NetConfig VALUES
       nntp_hosts
       snpp_hosts
       pop3_hosts
       smtp_hosts
       ph_hosts
       daytime_hosts
       time_hosts
	   Each is a reference to an array of hostnames (in order of
	   preference), which should be used for the given protocol

       inet_domain
	   Your internet domain name

       ftp_firewall
	   If you have an FTP proxy firewall (NOT an HTTP or SOCKS firewall)
	   then this value should be set to the firewall hostname. If your
	   firewall does not listen to port 21, then this value should be set
	   to "hostname:port" (eg "hostname:99")

       ftp_firewall_type
	   There are many different ftp firewall products available. But
	   unfortunately there is no standard for how to traverse a firewall.
	   The list below shows the sequence of commands that Net::FTP will
	   use

	     user	 Username for remote host
	     pass	 Password for remote host
	     fwuser	 Username for firewall
	     fwpass	 Password for firewall
	     remote.host The hostname of the remote ftp server

	   0   There is no firewall

	   1
		    USER user@remote.host
		    PASS pass

	   2
		    USER fwuser
		    PASS fwpass
		    USER user@remote.host
		    PASS pass

	   3
		    USER fwuser
		    PASS fwpass
		    SITE remote.site
		    USER user
		    PASS pass

	   4
		    USER fwuser
		    PASS fwpass
		    OPEN remote.site
		    USER user
		    PASS pass

	   5
		    USER user@fwuser@remote.site
		    PASS pass@fwpass

	   6
		    USER fwuser@remote.site
		    PASS fwpass
		    USER user
		    PASS pass

	   7
		    USER user@remote.host
		    PASS pass
		    AUTH fwuser
		    RESP fwpass

       ftp_ext_passive
       ftp_int_passive
	   FTP servers can work in passive or active mode. Active mode is when
	   you want to transfer data you have to tell the server the address
	   and port to connect to.  Passive mode is when the server provide
	   the address and port and you establish the connection.

	   With some firewalls active mode does not work as the server cannot
	   connect to your machine (because you are behind a firewall) and the
	   firewall does not re-write the command. In this case you should set
	   "ftp_ext_passive" to a true value.

	   Some servers are configured to only work in passive mode. If you
	   have one of these you can force "Net::FTP" to always transfer in
	   passive mode; when not going via a firewall, by setting
	   "ftp_int_passive" to a true value.

       local_netmask
	   A reference to a list of netmask strings in the form
	   "134.99.4.0/24".  These are used by the "requires_firewall"
	   function to determine if a given host is inside or outside your
	   firewall.

       The following entries are used during installation & testing on the
       libnet package

       test_hosts
	   If true then "make test" may attempt to connect to hosts given in
	   the configuration.

       test_exists
	   If true then "Configure" will check each hostname given that it
	   exists
