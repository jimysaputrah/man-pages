NAME
       Path::Class::Dir - Objects representing directories

SYNOPSIS
	 use Path::Class qw(dir);  # Export a short constructor

	 my $dir = dir('foo', 'bar');	    # Path::Class::Dir object
	 my $dir = Path::Class::Dir-&gtnew('foo', 'bar');  # Same thing

	 # Stringifies to 'foo/bar' on Unix, 'foo\bar' on Windows, etc.
	 print "dir: $dir\n";

	 if ($dir-&gtis_absolute) { ... }
	 if ($dir-&gtis_relative) { ... }

	 my $v = $dir-&gtvolume; # Could be 'C:' on Windows, empty string
			       # on Unix, 'Macintosh HD:' on Mac OS

	 $dir-&gtcleanup; # Perform logical cleanup of pathname
	 $dir-&gtresolve; # Perform physical cleanup of pathname

	 my $file = $dir-&gtfile('file.txt'); # A file in this directory
	 my $subdir = $dir-&gtsubdir('george'); # A subdirectory
	 my $parent = $dir-&gtparent; # The parent directory, 'foo'

	 my $abs = $dir-&gtabsolute; # Transform to absolute path
	 my $rel = $abs-&gtrelative; # Transform to relative path
	 my $rel = $abs-&gtrelative('/foo'); # Relative to /foo

	 print $dir-&gtas_foreign('Mac');   # :foo:bar:
	 print $dir-&gtas_foreign('Win32'); #  foo\bar

	 # Iterate with IO::Dir methods:
	 my $handle = $dir-&gtopen;
	 while (my $file = $handle-&gtread) {
	   $file = $dir-&gtfile($file);  # Turn into Path::Class::File object
	   ...
	 }

	 # Iterate with Path::Class methods:
	 while (my $file = $dir-&gtnext) {
	   # $file is a Path::Class::File or Path::Class::Dir object
	   ...
	 }

DESCRIPTION
       The "Path::Class::Dir" class contains functionality for manipulating
       directory names in a cross-platform way.

METHODS
       $dir = Path::Class::Dir-&gtnew( &ltdir1&gt, &ltdir2&gt, ... )
       $dir = dir( &ltdir1&gt, &ltdir2&gt, ... )
	   Creates a new "Path::Class::Dir" object and returns it.  The
	   arguments specify names of directories which will be joined to
	   create a single directory object.  A volume may also be specified
	   as the first argument, or as part of the first argument.  You can
	   use platform-neutral syntax:

	     my $dir = dir( 'foo', 'bar', 'baz' );

	   or platform-native syntax:

	     my $dir = dir( 'foo/bar/baz' );

	   or a mixture of the two:

	     my $dir = dir( 'foo/bar', 'baz' );

	   All three of the above examples create relative paths.  To create
	   an absolute path, either use the platform native syntax for doing
	   so:

	     my $dir = dir( '/var/tmp' );

	   or use an empty string as the first argument:

	     my $dir = dir( '', 'var', 'tmp' );

	   If the second form seems awkward, that's somewhat intentional -
	   paths like "/var/tmp" or "\Windows" aren't cross-platform concepts
	   in the first place (many non-Unix platforms don't have a notion of
	   a "root directory"), so they probably shouldn't appear in your code
	   if you're trying to be cross-platform.  The first form is perfectly
	   natural, because paths like this may come from config files, user
	   input, or whatever.

	   As a special case, since it doesn't otherwise mean anything useful
	   and it's convenient to define this way, "Path::Class::Dir-&gtnew()"
	   (or "dir()") refers to the current directory
	   ("File::Spec-&gtcurdir").  To get the current directory as an
	   absolute path, do "dir()-&gtabsolute".

	   Finally, as another special case "dir(undef)" will return undef,
	   since that's usually an accident on the part of the caller, and
	   returning the root directory would be a nasty surprise just asking
	   for trouble a few lines later.

       $dir-&gtstringify
	   This method is called internally when a "Path::Class::Dir" object
	   is used in a string context, so the following are equivalent:

	     $string = $dir-&gtstringify;
	     $string = "$dir";

       $dir-&gtvolume
	   Returns the volume (e.g. "C:" on Windows, "Macintosh HD:" on Mac
	   OS, etc.) of the directory object, if any.  Otherwise, returns the
	   empty string.

       $dir-&gtis_dir
	   Returns a boolean value indicating whether this object represents a
	   directory.  Not surprisingly, "Path::Class::File" objects always
	   return false, and "Path::Class::Dir" objects always return true.

       $dir-&gtis_absolute
	   Returns true or false depending on whether the directory refers to
	   an absolute path specifier (like "/usr/local" or "\Windows").

       $dir-&gtis_relative
	   Returns true or false depending on whether the directory refers to
	   a relative path specifier (like "lib/foo" or "./dir").

       $dir-&gtcleanup
	   Performs a logical cleanup of the file path.  For instance:

	     my $dir = dir('/foo//baz/./foo')-&gtcleanup;
	     # $dir now represents '/foo/baz/foo';

       $dir-&gtresolve
	   Performs a physical cleanup of the file path.  For instance:

	     my $dir = dir('/foo//baz/../foo')-&gtresolve;
	     # $dir now represents '/foo/foo', assuming no symlinks

	   This actually consults the filesystem to verify the validity of the
	   path.

       $file = $dir-&gtfile( &ltdir1&gt, &ltdir2&gt, ..., &ltfile&gt )
	   Returns a "Path::Class::File" object representing an entry in $dir
	   or one of its subdirectories.  Internally, this just calls
	   "Path::Class::File-&gtnew( @_ )".

       $subdir = $dir-&gtsubdir( &ltdir1&gt, &ltdir2&gt, ... )
	   Returns a new "Path::Class::Dir" object representing a subdirectory
	   of $dir.

       $parent = $dir-&gtparent
	   Returns the parent directory of $dir.  Note that this is the
	   logical parent, not necessarily the physical parent.  It really
	   means we just chop off entries from the end of the directory list
	   until we cain't chop no more.  If the directory is relative, we
	   start using the relative forms of parent directories.

	   The following code demonstrates the behavior on absolute and
	   relative directories:

	     $dir = dir('/foo/bar');
	     for (1..6) {
	       print "Absolute: $dir\n";
	       $dir = $dir-&gtparent;
	     }

	     $dir = dir('foo/bar');
	     for (1..6) {
	       print "Relative: $dir\n";
	       $dir = $dir-&gtparent;
	     }

	     ########### Output on Unix ################
	     Absolute: /foo/bar
	     Absolute: /foo
	     Absolute: /
	     Absolute: /
	     Absolute: /
	     Absolute: /
	     Relative: foo/bar
	     Relative: foo
	     Relative: .
	     Relative: ..
	     Relative: ../..
	     Relative: ../../..

       @list = $dir-&gtchildren
	   Returns a list of "Path::Class::File" and/or "Path::Class::Dir"
	   objects listed in this directory, or in scalar context the number
	   of such objects.  Obviously, it is necessary for $dir to exist and
	   be readable in order to find its children.

	   Note that the children are returned as subdirectories of $dir, i.e.
	   the children of foo will be foo/bar and foo/baz, not bar and baz.

	   Ordinarily "children()" will not include the self and parent
	   entries "." and ".." (or their equivalents on non-Unix systems),
	   because that's like I'm-my-own-grandpa business.  If you do want
	   all directory entries including these special ones, pass a true
	   value for the "all" parameter:

	     @c = $dir-&gtchildren(); # Just the children
	     @c = $dir-&gtchildren(all =&gt 1); # All entries

       $abs = $dir-&gtabsolute
	   Returns a "Path::Class::Dir" object representing $dir as an
	   absolute path.  An optional argument, given as either a string or a
	   "Path::Class::Dir" object, specifies the directory to use as the
	   base of relativity - otherwise the current working directory will
	   be used.

       $rel = $dir-&gtrelative
	   Returns a "Path::Class::Dir" object representing $dir as a relative
	   path.  An optional argument, given as either a string or a
	   "Path::Class::Dir" object, specifies the directory to use as the
	   base of relativity - otherwise the current working directory will
	   be used.

       $boolean = $dir-&gtsubsumes($other)
	   Returns true if this directory spec subsumes the other spec, and
	   false otherwise.  Think of "subsumes" as "contains", but we only
	   look at the specs, not whether $dir actually contains $other on the
	   filesystem.

	   The $other argument may be a "Path::Class::Dir" object, a
	   "Path::Class::File" object, or a string.  In the latter case, we
	   assume it's a directory.

	     # Examples:
	     dir('foo/bar' )-&gtsubsumes(dir('foo/bar/baz'))  # True
	     dir('/foo/bar')-&gtsubsumes(dir('/foo/bar/baz')) # True
	     dir('foo/bar' )-&gtsubsumes(dir('bar/baz'))	    # False
	     dir('/foo/bar')-&gtsubsumes(dir('foo/bar'))	    # False

       $boolean = $dir-&gtcontains($other)
	   Returns true if this directory actually contains $other on the
	   filesystem.	$other doesn't have to be a direct child of $dir, it
	   just has to be subsumed.

       $foreign = $dir-&gtas_foreign($type)
	   Returns a "Path::Class::Dir" object representing $dir as it would
	   be specified on a system of type $type.  Known types include
	   "Unix", "Win32", "Mac", "VMS", and "OS2", i.e. anything for which
	   there is a subclass of "File::Spec".

	   Any generated objects (subdirectories, files, parents, etc.) will
	   also retain this type.

       $foreign = Path::Class::Dir-&gtnew_foreign($type, @args)
	   Returns a "Path::Class::Dir" object representing $dir as it would
	   be specified on a system of type $type.  Known types include
	   "Unix", "Win32", "Mac", "VMS", and "OS2", i.e. anything for which
	   there is a subclass of "File::Spec".

	   The arguments in @args are the same as they would be specified in
	   "new()".

       @list = $dir-&gtdir_list([OFFSET, [LENGTH]])
	   Returns the list of strings internally representing this directory
	   structure.  Each successive member of the list is understood to be
	   an entry in its predecessor's directory list.  By contract,
	   "Path::Class-&gtnew( $dir-&gtdir_list )" should be equivalent to $dir.

	   The semantics of this method are similar to Perl's "splice" or
	   "substr" functions; they return "LENGTH" elements starting at
	   "OFFSET".  If "LENGTH" is omitted, returns all the elements
	   starting at "OFFSET" up to the end of the list.  If "LENGTH" is
	   negative, returns the elements from "OFFSET" onward except for
	   "-LENGTH" elements at the end.  If "OFFSET" is negative, it counts
	   backward "OFFSET" elements from the end of the list.  If "OFFSET"
	   and "LENGTH" are both omitted, the entire list is returned.

	   In a scalar context, "dir_list()" with no arguments returns the
	   number of entries in the directory list; "dir_list(OFFSET)" returns
	   the single element at that offset; "dir_list(OFFSET, LENGTH)"
	   returns the final element that would have been returned in a list
	   context.

       $fh = $dir-&gtopen()
	   Passes $dir to "IO::Dir-&gtopen" and returns the result as an
	   "IO::Dir" object.  If the opening fails, "undef" is returned and $!
	   is set.

       $dir-&gtmkpath($verbose, $mode)
	   Passes all arguments, including $dir, to "File::Path::mkpath()" and
	   returns the result (a list of all directories created).

       $dir-&gtrmtree($verbose, $cautious)
	   Passes all arguments, including $dir, to "File::Path::rmtree()" and
	   returns the result (the number of files successfully deleted).

       $dir-&gtremove()
	   Removes the directory, which must be empty.	Returns a boolean
	   value indicating whether or not the directory was successfully
	   removed.  This method is mainly provided for consistency with
	   "Path::Class::File"'s "remove()" method.

       $dir_or_file = $dir-&gtnext()
	   A convenient way to iterate through directory contents.  The first
	   time "next()" is called, it will "open()" the directory and read
	   the first item from it, returning the result as a
	   "Path::Class::Dir" or "Path::Class::File" object (depending, of
	   course, on its actual type).  Each subsequent call to "next()" will
	   simply iterate over the directory's contents, until there are no
	   more items in the directory, and then the undefined value is
	   returned.  For example, to iterate over all the regular files in a
	   directory:

	     while (my $file = $dir-&gtnext) {
	       next unless -f $file;
	       my $fh = $file-&gtopen('r') or die "Can't read $file: $!";
	       ...
	     }

	   If an error occurs when opening the directory (for instance, it
	   doesn't exist or isn't readable), "next()" will throw an exception
	   with the value of $!.

       $dir-&gtrecurse( callback =&gt sub {...} )
	   Iterates through this directory and all of its children, and all of
	   its children's children, etc., calling the "callback" subroutine
	   for each entry.  This is a lot like what the "File::Find" module
	   does, and of course "File::Find" will work fine on "Path::Class"
	   objects, but the advantage of the "recurse()" method is that it
	   will also feed your callback routine "Path::Class" objects rather
	   than just pathname strings.

	   The "recurse()" method requires a "callback" parameter specifying
	   the subroutine to invoke for each entry.  It will be passed the
	   "Path::Class" object as its first argument.

	   "recurse()" also accepts two boolean parameters, "depthfirst" and
	   "preorder" that control the order of recursion.  The default is a
	   preorder, breadth-first search, i.e. "depthfirst =&gt 0, preorder =&gt
	   1".	At the time of this writing, all combinations of these two
	   parameters are supported except "depthfirst =&gt 0, preorder =&gt 0".

       $st = $file-&gtstat()
	   Invokes "File::stat::stat()" on this directory and returns a
	   "File::stat" object representing the result.

       $st = $file-&gtlstat()
	   Same as "stat()", but if $file is a symbolic link, "lstat()" stats
	   the link instead of the directory the link points to.
