VERSION
       version 2.0205

SYNOPSIS
	 package BankAccount;
	 use Moose;

	 has 'balance' =&gt ( isa =&gt 'Int', is =&gt 'rw', default =&gt 0 );

	 sub deposit {
	     my ( $self, $amount ) = @_;
	     $self-&gtbalance( $self-&gtbalance + $amount );
	 }

	     my ( $self, $amount ) = @_;
	     my $current_balance = $self-&gtbalance();
	     ( $current_balance &gt= $amount )
		 || confess "Account overdrawn";
	     $self-&gtbalance( $current_balance - $amount );
	 }

	 package CheckingAccount;
	 use Moose;

	 extends 'BankAccount';

	 has 'overdraft_account' =&gt ( isa =&gt 'BankAccount', is =&gt 'rw' );

	 before 'withdraw' =&gt sub {
	     my ( $self, $amount ) = @_;
	     my $overdraft_amount = $amount - $self-&gtbalance();
	     if ( $self-&gtoverdraft_account && $overdraft_amount &gt 0 ) {
		 $self-&gtoverdraft_account-&gtwithdraw($overdraft_amount);
		 $self-&gtdeposit($overdraft_amount);
	     }
	 };

DESCRIPTION
       The first recipe demonstrated how to build very basic Moose classes,
       focusing on creating and manipulating attributes. The objects in that
       recipe were very data-oriented, and did not have much in the way of
       behavior (i.e. methods). In this recipe, we expand upon the concepts
       from the first recipe to include some real behavior. In particular, we
       show how you can use a method modifier to implement new behavior for a
       method.

       The classes in the SYNOPSIS show two kinds of bank account. A simple
       bank account has one attribute, the balance, and two behaviors,
       depositing and withdrawing money.

       We then extend the basic bank account in the CheckingAccount class.
       This class adds another attribute, an overdraft account. It also adds
       overdraft protection to the withdraw method. If you try to withdraw
       more than you have, the checking account attempts to reconcile the
       difference by withdrawing money from the overdraft account. (1)

       The first class, BankAccount, introduces a new attribute feature, a
       default value:

	 has 'balance' =&gt ( isa =&gt 'Int', is =&gt 'rw', default =&gt 0 );

       This says that a BankAccount has a "balance" attribute, which has an
       "Int" type constraint, a read/write accessor, and a default value of 0.
       This means that every instance of BankAccount that is created will have
       its "balance" slot initialized to 0, unless some other value is
       provided to the constructor.

       The "deposit" and "withdraw" methods should be fairly self-explanatory,
       as they are just plain old Perl 5 OO. (2)

       As you know from the first recipe, the keyword "extends" sets a class's
       superclass. Here we see that CheckingAccount "extends" BankAccount. The
       next line introduces yet another new attribute feature, class-based
       type constraints:

	 has 'overdraft_account' =&gt ( isa =&gt 'BankAccount', is =&gt 'rw' );

       Up until now, we have only seen the "Int" type constraint, which (as we
       saw in the first recipe) is a builtin type constraint. The
       "BankAccount" type constraint is new, and was actually defined the
       moment we created the BankAccount class itself. In fact, Moose creates
       a corresponding type constraint for every class in your program (3).

       This means that in the first recipe, constraints for both "Point" and
       "Point3D" were created. In this recipe, both "BankAccount" and
       "CheckingAccount" type constraints are created automatically. Moose
       does this as a convenience so that your classes and type constraint can
       be kept in sync with one another. In short, Moose makes sure that it
       will just DWIM (4).

       In CheckingAccount, we see another method modifier, the "before"
       modifier.

	 before 'withdraw' =&gt sub {
	     my ( $self, $amount ) = @_;
	     my $overdraft_amount = $amount - $self-&gtbalance();
	     if ( $self-&gtoverdraft_account && $overdraft_amount &gt 0 ) {
		 $self-&gtoverdraft_account-&gtwithdraw($overdraft_amount);
		 $self-&gtdeposit($overdraft_amount);
	     }
	 };

       Just as with the "after" modifier from the first recipe, Moose will
       handle calling the superclass method (in this case
       "BankAccount-&gtwithdraw").

       The "before" modifier will (obviously) run before the code from the
       superclass is run. Here, "before" modifier implements overdraft
       protection by first checking if there are available funds in the
       checking account. If not (and if there is an overdraft account
       available), it transfers the amount needed into the checking account
       (5).

       As with the method modifier in the first recipe, we could use "SUPER::"
       to get the same effect:

	 sub withdraw {
	     my ( $self, $amount ) = @_;
	     my $overdraft_amount = $amount - $self-&gtbalance();
	     if ( $self-&gtoverdraft_account && $overdraft_amount &gt 0 ) {
		 $self-&gtoverdraft_account-&gtwithdraw($overdraft_amount);
		 $self-&gtdeposit($overdraft_amount);
	     }
	     $self-&gtSUPER::withdraw($amount);
	 }

       The benefit of taking the method modifier approach is we do not need to
       remember to call "SUPER::withdraw" and pass it the $amount argument
       when writing "CheckingAccount-&gtwithdraw".

       This is actually more than just a convenience for forgetful
       programmers. Using method modifiers helps isolate subclasses from
       changes in the superclasses. For instance, if BankAccount-&gtwithdraw
       were to add an additional argument of some kind, the version of
       CheckingAccount-&gtwithdraw which uses "SUPER::withdraw" would not pass
       that extra argument correctly, whereas the method modifier version
       would automatically pass along all arguments correctly.

       Just as with the first recipe, object instantiation uses the "new"
       method, which accepts named parameters.

	 my $savings_account = BankAccount-&gtnew( balance =&gt 250 );

	 my $checking_account = CheckingAccount-&gtnew(
	     balance	       =&gt 100,
	     overdraft_account =&gt $savings_account,
	 );

       And as with the first recipe, a more in-depth example can be found in
       the t/recipes/moose_cookbook_basics_recipe2.t test file.

CONCLUSION
       This recipe expanded on the basic concepts from the first recipe with a
       more "real world" use case.

FOOTNOTES
       (1) If you're paying close attention, you might realize that there's a
	   circular loop waiting to happen here. A smarter example would have
	   to make sure that we don't accidentally create a loop between the
	   checking account and its overdraft account.

       (2) Note that for simple methods like these, which just manipulate some
	   single piece of data, it is often not necessary to write them at
	   all.  For instance, "deposit" could be implemented via the "inc"
	   native delegation for counters - see
	   Moose::Meta::Attribute::Native::Trait::Counter for more specifics,
	   and Moose::Meta::Attribute::Native for a broader overview.

       (3) In reality, this creation is sensitive to the order in which
	   modules are loaded. In more complicated cases, you may find that
	   you need to explicitly declare a class type before the
	   corresponding class is loaded.

       (4) Moose does not attempt to encode a class's is-a relationships
	   within the type constraint hierarchy. Instead, Moose just considers
	   the class type constraint to be a subtype of "Object", and
	   specializes the constraint check to allow for subclasses. This
	   means that an instance of CheckingAccount will pass a "BankAccount"
	   type constraint successfully. For more details, please refer to the
	   Moose::Util::TypeConstraints documentation.

       (5) If the overdraft account does not have the amount needed, it will
	   throw an error. Of course, the overdraft account could also have
	   overdraft protection. See note 1.
