NAME
       curl_share_setopt - Set options for a shared object

SYNOPSIS
       #include &ltcurl/curl.h&gt

       CURLSHcode curl_share_setopt(CURLSH *share, CURLSHoption option, param-
       eter);

DESCRIPTION
       Set the option to parameter for the given share.

OPTIONS
       CURLSHOPT_LOCKFUNC
	      The parameter must be a pointer to a function matching the  fol-
	      lowing prototype:

	      void    lock_function(CURL    *handle,	curl_lock_data	 data,
	      curl_lock_access access, void *userptr);

	      data defines what data libcurl wants to lock, and you must  make
	      sure  that  only	one lock is given at any time for each kind of
	      data.

	      access defines what access type libcurl wants, shared or single.

	      userptr is the pointer you set with CURLSHOPT_USERDATA.

       CURLSHOPT_UNLOCKFUNC
	      The  parameter must be a pointer to a function matching the fol-
	      lowing prototype:

	      void unlock_function(CURL  *handle,  curl_lock_data  data,  void
	      *userptr);

	      data  defines  what  data  libcurl wants to unlock, and you must
	      make sure that only one lock is given at any time for each  kind
	      of data.

	      userptr is the pointer you set with CURLSHOPT_USERDATA.

       CURLSHOPT_SHARE
	      The  parameter  specifies  a type of data that should be shared.
	      This may be set to one of the values described below.

	      CURL_LOCK_DATA_COOKIE
		     Cookie data will be shared across the easy handles  using
		     this shared object.

	      CURL_LOCK_DATA_DNS
		     Cached  DNS  hosts will be shared across the easy handles
		     using this shared object. Note  that  when  you  use  the
		     multi interface, all easy handles added to the same multi
		     handle will share DNS cache by default without this  hav-
		     ing to be used!

	      CURL_LOCK_DATA_SSL_SESSION
		     SSL  session  IDs will be shared accross the easy handles
		     using this shared object. This will reduce the time spent
		     in  the  SSL  handshake  when  reconnecting  to  the same
		     server. Note SSL session IDs are reused within  the  same
		     easy handle by default.

       CURLSHOPT_UNSHARE
	      This  option  does the opposite of CURLSHOPT_SHARE. It specifies
	      that the specified parameter will no  longer  be	shared.  Valid
	      values are the same as those for CURLSHOPT_SHARE.

       CURLSHOPT_USERDATA
	      The  parameter allows you to specify a pointer to data that will
	      be passed to the lock_function and unlock_function each time  it
	      is called.

RETURN VALUE
       CURLSHE_OK  (zero)  means  that	the  option was set properly, non-zero
       means an error occurred as  &ltcurl/curl.h&gt  defines.  See  the  libcurl-
       errors.3 man page for the full list with descriptions.
