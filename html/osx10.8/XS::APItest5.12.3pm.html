NAME
       XS::APItest - Test the perl C API

SYNOPSIS
	 use XS::APItest;
	 print_double(4);

ABSTRACT
       This module tests the perl C API. Currently tests that "printf" works
       correctly.

DESCRIPTION
       This module can be used to check that the perl C API is behaving
       correctly. This module provides test functions and an associated test
       script that verifies the output.

       This module is not meant to be installed.

   EXPORT
       Exports all the test functions:

       print_double
	   Test that a double-precision floating point number is formatted
	   correctly by "printf".

	     print_double( $val );

	   Output is sent to STDOUT.

       print_long_double
	   Test that a "long double" is formatted correctly by "printf". Takes
	   no arguments - the test value is hard-wired into the function (as
	   "7").

	     print_long_double();

	   Output is sent to STDOUT.

       have_long_double
	   Determine whether a "long double" is supported by Perl.  This
	   should be used to determine whether to test "print_long_double".

	     print_long_double() if have_long_double;

       print_nv
	   Test that an "NV" is formatted correctly by "printf".

	     print_nv( $val );

	   Output is sent to STDOUT.

       print_iv
	   Test that an "IV" is formatted correctly by "printf".

	     print_iv( $val );

	   Output is sent to STDOUT.

       print_uv
	   Test that an "UV" is formatted correctly by "printf".

	     print_uv( $val );

	   Output is sent to STDOUT.

       print_int
	   Test that an "int" is formatted correctly by "printf".

	     print_int( $val );

	   Output is sent to STDOUT.

       print_long
	   Test that an "long" is formatted correctly by "printf".

	     print_long( $val );

	   Output is sent to STDOUT.

       print_float
	   Test that a single-precision floating point number is formatted
	   correctly by "printf".

	     print_float( $val );

	   Output is sent to STDOUT.

       call_sv, call_pv, call_method
	   These exercise the C calls of the same names. Everything after the
	   flags arg is passed as the the args to the called function. They
	   return whatever the C function itself pushed onto the stack, plus
	   the return value from the function; for example

	       call_sv( sub { @_, 'c' }, G_ARRAY,  'a', 'b'); # returns 'a', 'b', 'c', 3
	       call_sv( sub { @_ },	 G_SCALAR, 'a', 'b'); # returns 'b', 1

       eval_sv
	   Evaluates the passed SV. Result handling is done the same as for
	   "call_sv()" etc.

       eval_pv
	   Exercises the C function of the same name in scalar context.
	   Returns the same SV that the C function returns.

       require_pv
	   Exercises the C function of the same name. Returns nothing.
