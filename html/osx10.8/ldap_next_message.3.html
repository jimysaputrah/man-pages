NAME
       ldap_first_message,  ldap_next_message,	ldap_count_messages - Stepping
       through messages in a result chain

LIBRARY
       OpenLDAP LDAP (libldap, -lldap)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <ldap.h>

       int ldap_count_messages( LDAP *ld, LDAPMessage *result )

       LDAPMessage *ldap_first_message( LDAP *ld, LDAPMessage *result )

       LDAPMessage *ldap_next_message( LDAP *ld, LDAPMessage *message )

DESCRIPTION
       These routines are used to step through the messages in a result  chain
       received  from ldap_result(3).  For search operations, the result chain
       can contain referral, entry and result  messages.  The  ldap_msgtype(3)
       function  can  be  used	to  distinguish  between the different message
       types.

       The ldap_first_message() routine is used to retrieve the first  message
       in  a  result  chain.   It  takes  the  result as returned by a call to
       ldap_result(3), ldap_search_s(3) or  ldap_search_st(3)  and  returns  a
       pointer to the first message in the result chain.

       This  pointer should be supplied on a subsequent call to ldap_next_mes-
       sage() to get the next message, the result of which should be  supplied
       to the next call to ldap_next_message(), etc.  ldap_next_message() will
       return NULL when there are no more messages.

       These   functions    are    useful    when    using    routines	  like
       ldap_parse_result(3)  that  only  operate  on  the  first result in the
       chain.

       A count of the number of messages in the result chain can  be  obtained
       by  calling  ldap_count_messages().   It  can also be used to count the
       number of remaining messages in a chain if called with a message, entry
       or  reference  returned by ldap_first_message() , ldap_next_message() ,
       ldap_first_entry(3),    ldap_next_entry(3),    ldap_first_reference(3),
       ldap_next_reference(3).

ERRORS
       If an error occurs in ldap_first_message() or ldap_next_message(), NULL
       is returned.  If  an  error  occurs  in	ldap_count_messages(),	-1  is
       returned.
