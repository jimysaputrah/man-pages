NAME
       DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::ODBC::ACCESS - Support specific to MS Access
       over ODBC

DESCRIPTION
       This class implements support specific to Microsoft Access over ODBC.

       It is a subclass of DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::ODBC and
       DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::ACCESS, see those classes for more
       information.

       It is loaded automatically by by DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::ODBC when
       it detects a MS Access back-end.

       This driver implements workarounds for "IMAGE" and "MEMO" columns, and
       DBIx::Class::InflateColumn::DateTime support for "DATETIME" columns.

EXAMPLE DSN
	 dbi:ODBC:driver={Microsoft Access Driver (*.mdb, *.accdb)};dbq=C:\Users\rkitover\Documents\access_sample.accdb

TEXT/IMAGE/MEMO COLUMNS
       Avoid using "TEXT" columns as they will be truncated to 255 bytes. Some
       other drivers (like ADO) will automatically convert "TEXT" columns to
       "MEMO", but the ODBC driver does not.

       "IMAGE" columns work correctly, but the statements for inserting or
       updating an "IMAGE" column will not be cached, due to a bug in the
       Access ODBC driver.

       "MEMO" columns work correctly as well, but you must take care to set
       LongReadLen to "$max_memo_size * 2 + 1". This is done for you
       automatically if you pass LongReadLen in your connect_info; but if you
       set this attribute directly on the $dbh, keep this limitation in mind.
