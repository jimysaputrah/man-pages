NAME
       PPI::Token::QuoteLike - Quote-like operator abstract base class

INHERITANCE
	 PPI::Token::QuoteLike
	 isa PPI::Token
	     isa PPI::Element

DESCRIPTION
       The "PPI::Token::QuoteLike" class is never instantiated, and simply
       provides a common abstract base class for the five quote-like operator
       classes. In PPI, a "quote-like" is the set of quote-like things that
       exclude the string quotes and regular expressions.

       The subclasses of "PPI::Token::QuoteLike" are:

       qw{} - PPI::Token::QuoteLike::Words
       `` - PPI::Token::QuoteLike::Backtick
       qx{} - PPI::Token::QuoteLike::Command
       qr// - PPI::Token::QuoteLike::Regexp
       <FOO> - PPI::Token::QuoteLike::Readline

       The names are hopefully obvious enough not to have to explain what each
       class is. See their pages for more details.

       You may note that the backtick and command quote-like are treated
       separately, even though they do the same thing. This is intentional, as
       the inherit from and are processed by two different parts of the PPI's
       quote engine.
