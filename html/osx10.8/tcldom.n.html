DESCRIPTION
       TclDOM is a Tcl language binding for the  (DOM).  DOM provides  a  view
       of  a  XML  (or	HTML) document as a tree structure.  Currently, TclDOM
       only supports XML documents.


       The package implements most of the DOM Level 1 interfaces and also some
       Level  2  and Level 3 interfaces.  There are also a number of non-stan-
       dard commands and methods provided for the convenience  of  application
       developers (these are documented).


       The DOM specification should be read in conjunction with this reference
       manual, as it explains the meaning and purpose of  the  various	inter-
       faces.  This manual is not a tutorial on how to use the DOM.


       TclDOM also provides several implementations of the API, with a layered
       architecture.  A generic layer provides a stable API  to  the  applica-
       tion, and specific implementations may register themselves.  Currently,
       three implementations exists: a pure-Tcl implementation, a C  implemen-
       tation  (based  on TclDOMPro) and another C implementation based on the
       Gnome libxml2 & gdome2 libraries.


PACKAGES AND NAMESPACES
       The TclDOM generic layer defines the  package and also a Tcl  namespace
       using that name.  The generic layer also uses the package name .


       Implementations	define their own package name and Tcl namespace within
       the generic layer:



	      Tcl implementation

	      Package , Tcl namespace ::dom::tcl.


	      TclDOMPro

	      Package , Tcl namespace ::dom::c.


	      libxml2

	      Package , Tcl namespace ::dom::libxml2.



TOKENS
       The TclDOM API uses  as identifiers for nodes within  the  docu-
       ment  tree.   This  technique  has  been used to allow alternate
       implementations of TclDOM to be efficient, while retaining  com-
       patibility with the pure-Tcl implementation.


       The  format  of	the  token itself as well as the data structure
       referred to by the token are  public and an  application  should
       not  rely  on  these.   Instead,  an  application should use the
       accessor methods provided by the API.


DOM INTERFACES
       Each  in the DOM specification is implemented with a Tcl command
       in  the dom namespace.  A few interfaces have not been mapped to
       Tcl commands because Tcl already provides the required function-
       ality, for example the  interface.


       s  for interfaces are methods (subcommands) of the corresponding
       Tcl command.


       Each  of an interface is a configuration option for an object in
       the document tree.


CONVENIENCE COMMANDS AND METHODS
       DOM doesn't always provide an interface, method or attribute for
       every function required.  For example, until DOM Level 3 for was
       no  standard  for  creating, parsing and serializing a document.
       Sometimes using the standard DOM interface is  awkward.	 TclDOM
       provides  a  number  of	non-standard features to overcome these
       problems.


       A major convenience is that each method	of  the   interface  is
       also  defined  as  a  command.	For  example, rather than using
       dom::DOMImplementation create to  create  a  new  document,  the
       shorter command dom::create may be used.


       Implementations	may also provide direct access to specific fea-
       tures.  Refer to the documentation for a DOM implementation.


COMMANDS
       ::dom::DOMImplementation


       The ::dom::DOMImplementation command implements the  DOM  inter-
       face.   It  is  used to provide implementation-specific features
       not explicitly defined in the DOM specification.


	      Command Options


	      The following command options may  be  used.   These  are
	      also available as commands.



		     hasFeature  hasFeature feature

		     Provides  a  test for existence of a
		     feature.  Returns	if a  feature  is
		     implemented,   otherwise.	 Uses the
		     default DOM implementation.


		     create  create type

		     Creates the root node of a  new  DOM
		     document,	 using	the  default  DOM
		     implementation.  The  document  ele-
		     ment  type  may  be  specified as an
		     argument, in which case that element
		     is  created.   The return value is a
		     token referring to the root node  of
		     the newly created document.


		     createDocument  createDocument nsURI
		     type doctype

		     Creates  the  root node of a new DOM
		     document,	using  the  default   DOM
		     implementation.   The  document ele-
		     ment namespace  URI  and  local-name
		     (element  type)  may be specified as
		     an argument, in which case that ele-
		     ment  is  created.   If the document
		     type is given then the newly created
		     document  is  configured to use that
		     document type.  The return value  is
		     a	token  referring to the root node
		     of the newly created document.


		     createDocumentType   createDocument-
		     Type  token  name	publicid systemid
		     internaldtd

		     Creates a Document Type Declaration,
		     using  the  default  DOM implementa-
		     tion.  The return value is  a  token
		     for  the newly created document type
		     declaration.


		     createNode  createNode token xpath

		     May create a node in  the	document.
		     token  specifies  a  context for the
		     XPath expression  given  by   xpath.
		     The  expression  must  resolve  to a
		     node.  If the node  exists  then  no
		     further  action is taken.	Otherwise
		     the node is created.  The	token  of
		     the matched or newly created node is
		     returned.


		     destroy  destroy token

		     This method frees	all  data  struc-
		     tures  associated	with  a DOM node.
		     The  token argument must refer to	a
		     valid token for any node in the doc-
		     ument tree.   The	node  is  removed
		     from   the   tree	 before   it   is
		     destroyed.  If the  node  has  chil-
		     dren, they will also be destroyed.


		     isNode  isNode token

		     Tests  whether  the given token is a
		     valid token for some DOM node in the
		     default DOM implementation.


		     parse  parse xml ? option value?

		     This  method  parses  XML	formatted
		     text given by the	xml argument  and
		     constructs  a DOM tree for the docu-
		     ment.   The  return  result  is  the
		     token  of the root node of the newly
		     created document.


		     This method requires an  event-based
		     XML  parser  to be loaded to perform
		     the parsing operation.  The  package
		     itself   does  not  include  an  XML
		     parser.  Support for the use of   is
		     provided.	Any other Tcl event-based
		     XML parser implementing  the  TclXML
		     API  may also be used.  The  -parser
		     may be used  to  specify  which  XML
		     parser to use.


		     In  some circumstances, a DOM imple-
		     mentation may parse the XML document
		     directly,	for  example libxml2.  In
		     this case, it may not be possible to
		     interpose	on the parsing operation.


		     Valid configuration options are:



			     -parser
			    ?	  {}
			    expat
			    tcl?

			    This
			    option
			    speci-
			    fies
			    which
			    XML
			    parser
			    to	 use
			    to parse
			    the  XML
			    data.
			    If	  an
			    empty
			    string
			    is given
			    then the
			    default
			    behav-
			    iour
			    described
			    above is
			    used.
			    The
			    value
			    expat
			    speci-
			    fies
			    that the
			    Expat
			    parser
			    must  be
			    used.
			    The
			    value
			    tcl
			    speci-
			    fies
			    that the
			    Tcl-only
			    parser
			    must  be
			    used.
			    If	  an
			    explicit
			    value is
			    given
			    and that
			    parser
			    cannot
			    be
			    loaded
			    then the
			    command
			    will
			    fail,
			    despite
			    the fact
			    that
			    another
			    parser
			    may   be
			    avail-
			    able.


			     -pro-
			    gress-
			    command
			    script

			    This
			    option
			    speci-
			    fies   a
			    Tcl com-
			    mand  to
			    be
			    invoked
			    from
			    time  to
			    time
			    while
			    the  DOM
			    tree  is
			    being
			    con-
			    structed.
			    The
			    script
			    will  be
			    invoked
			    after  a
			    certain
			    number
			    of	ele-
			    ment
			    start
			    tags
			    have
			    been
			    pro-
			    cessed,
			    given by
			    the
			    -chunk-
			    size
			    option.


			     -chunk-
			    size
			    integer

			    This
			    option
			    speci-
			    fies how
			    many
			    element
			    start
			    tags  to
			    process
			    before
			    invoking
			    the
			    script
			    given by
			    the
			    -pro-
			    gress-
			    command
			    option.



		     selectNode
		     selectNode
		     token  xpath  ?
		     option    value
		     ... ?

		     Resolves	 the
		     XPath  location
		     path  given  by
		     xpath.    token
		     is the  initial
		     context for the
		     location  path.
		     Returns	 the
		     resulting node-
		     set  as  a  Tcl
		     list.


		     The   following
		     options  may be
		     specified:



			     -names-
			    paces

			    The
			    value
			    for
			    this
			    option
			    is
			    a
			    list
			    of
			    pre-
			    fix-
			    URI
			    pairs.
			    Each
			    of
			    these
			    pairs
			    defines
			    an
			    XML
			    Names-
			    pace
			    and
			    its
			    pre-
			    fix
			    for
			    the
			    pur-
			    poses
			    of
			    eval-
			    u-
			    at-
			    ing
			    the
			    XPath
			    expres-
			    sion.
			    The
			    doc-

			    itself
			    may

			    for
			    the
			    same
			    XML
			    Names-

			    This
			    option
			    may
			    be
			    repeated,
			    in
			    which
			    case
			    the
			    lists
			    of
			    names-
			    pace
			    pairs
			    are
			    merged
			    and
