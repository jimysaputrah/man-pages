NAME
       Net::POP3 - Post Office Protocol 3 Client class (RFC1939)

SYNOPSIS
	   use Net::POP3;

	   # Constructors
	   $pop = Net::POP3-&gtnew('pop3host');
	   $pop = Net::POP3-&gtnew('pop3host', Timeout =&gt 60);

	   if ($pop-&gtlogin($username, $password) &gt 0) {
	     my $msgnums = $pop-&gtlist; # hashref of msgnum =&gt size
	     foreach my $msgnum (keys %$msgnums) {
	       my $msg = $pop-&gtget($msgnum);
	       print @$msg;
	       $pop-&gtdelete($msgnum);
	     }
	   }

	   $pop-&gtquit;

DESCRIPTION
       This module implements a client interface to the POP3 protocol,
       enabling a perl5 application to talk to POP3 servers. This
       documentation assumes that you are familiar with the POP3 protocol
       described in RFC1939.

       A new Net::POP3 object must be created with the new method. Once this
       has been done, all POP3 commands are accessed via method calls on the
       object.

CONSTRUCTOR
       new ( [ HOST ] [, OPTIONS ] 0
	   This is the constructor for a new Net::POP3 object. "HOST" is the
	   name of the remote host to which an POP3 connection is required.

	   "HOST" is optional. If "HOST" is not given then it may instead be
	   passed as the "Host" option described below. If neither is given
	   then the "POP3_Hosts" specified in "Net::Config" will be used.

	   "OPTIONS" are passed in a hash like fashion, using key and value
	   pairs.  Possible options are:

	   Host - POP3 host to connect to. It may be a single scalar, as
	   defined for the "PeerAddr" option in IO::Socket::INET, or a
	   reference to an array with hosts to try in turn. The "host" method
	   will return the value which was used to connect to the host.

	   ResvPort - If given then the socket for the "Net::POP3" object will
	   be bound to the local port given using "bind" when the socket is
	   created.

	   Timeout - Maximum time, in seconds, to wait for a response from the
	   POP3 server (default: 120)

	   Debug - Enable debugging information

METHODS
       Unless otherwise stated all methods return either a true or false
       value, with true meaning that the operation was a success. When a
       method states that it returns a value, failure will be returned as
       undef or an empty list.

       auth ( USERNAME, PASSWORD )
	   Attempt SASL authentication.

       user ( USER )
	   Send the USER command.

       pass ( PASS )
	   Send the PASS command. Returns the number of messages in the
	   mailbox.

       login ( [ USER [, PASS ]] )
	   Send both the USER and PASS commands. If "PASS" is not given the
	   "Net::POP3" uses "Net::Netrc" to lookup the password using the host
	   and username. If the username is not specified then the current
	   user name will be used.

	   Returns the number of messages in the mailbox. However if there are
	   no messages on the server the string "0E0" will be returned. This
	   is will give a true value in a boolean context, but zero in a
	   numeric context.

	   If there was an error authenticating the user then undef will be
	   returned.

       apop ( [ USER [, PASS ]] )
	   Authenticate with the server identifying as "USER" with password
	   "PASS".  Similar to "login", but the password is not sent in clear
	   text.

	   To use this method you must have the Digest::MD5 or the MD5 module
	   installed, otherwise this method will return undef.

       banner ()
	   Return the sever's connection banner

       capa ()
	   Return a reference to a hash of the capabilities of the server.
	   APOP is added as a pseudo capability.  Note that I've been unable
	   to find a list of the standard capability values, and some appear
	   to be multi-word and some are not.  We make an attempt at
	   intelligently parsing them, but it may not be correct.

       capabilities ()
	   Just like capa, but only uses a cache from the last time we asked
	   the server, so as to avoid asking more than once.

       top ( MSGNUM [, NUMLINES ] )
	   Get the header and the first "NUMLINES" of the body for the message
	   "MSGNUM". Returns a reference to an array which contains the lines
	   of text read from the server.

       list ( [ MSGNUM ] )
	   If called with an argument the "list" returns the size of the
	   message in octets.

	   If called without arguments a reference to a hash is returned. The
	   keys will be the "MSGNUM"'s of all undeleted messages and the
	   values will be their size in octets.

       get ( MSGNUM [, FH ] )
	   Get the message "MSGNUM" from the remote mailbox. If "FH" is not
	   given then get returns a reference to an array which contains the
	   lines of text read from the server. If "FH" is given then the lines
	   returned from the server are printed to the filehandle "FH".

       getfh ( MSGNUM )
	   As per get(), but returns a tied filehandle.  Reading from this
	   filehandle returns the requested message.  The filehandle will
	   return EOF at the end of the message and should not be reused.

       last ()
	   Returns the highest "MSGNUM" of all the messages accessed.

       popstat ()
	   Returns a list of two elements. These are the number of undeleted
	   elements and the size of the mbox in octets.

       ping ( USER )
	   Returns a list of two elements. These are the number of new
	   messages and the total number of messages for "USER".

       uidl ( [ MSGNUM ] )
	   Returns a unique identifier for "MSGNUM" if given. If "MSGNUM" is
	   not given "uidl" returns a reference to a hash where the keys are
	   the message numbers and the values are the unique identifiers.

       delete ( MSGNUM )
	   Mark message "MSGNUM" to be deleted from the remote mailbox. All
	   messages that are marked to be deleted will be removed from the
	   remote mailbox when the server connection closed.

       reset ()
	   Reset the status of the remote POP3 server. This includes resetting
	   the status of all messages to not be deleted.

       quit ()
	   Quit and close the connection to the remote POP3 server. Any
	   messages marked as deleted will be deleted from the remote mailbox.

NOTES
       If a "Net::POP3" object goes out of scope before "quit" method is
       called then the "reset" method will called before the connection is
       closed. This means that any messages marked to be deleted will not be.
