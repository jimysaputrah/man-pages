NAME
       ExtUtils::MM_MacOS - once produced Makefiles for MacOS Classic

SYNOPSIS
	 # MM_MacOS no longer contains any code.  This is just a stub.

DESCRIPTION
       Once upon a time, MakeMaker could produce an approximation of a correct
       Makefile on MacOS Classic (MacPerl).  Due to a lack of maintainers,
       this fell out of sync with the rest of MakeMaker and hadn't worked in
       years.  Since there's little chance of it being repaired, MacOS Classic
       is fading away, and the code was icky to begin with, the code has been
       deleted to make maintenance easier.

       Those interested in writing modules for MacPerl should use
       Module::Build which works better than MakeMaker ever did.

       Anyone interested in resurrecting this file should pull the old version
       from the MakeMaker CVS repository and contact makemaker@perl.org, but
       we really encourage you to work on Module::Build instead.
