NAME
       glDrawBuffer - specify which color buffers are to be drawn into


C SPECIFICATION
       void glDrawBuffer( GLenum mode )


PARAMETERS
       mode  Specifies	up  to	four color buffers to be drawn into.  Symbolic
	     constants GL_NONE, GL_FRONT_LEFT,	GL_FRONT_RIGHT,  GL_BACK_LEFT,
	     GL_BACK_RIGHT,	GL_FRONT,    GL_BACK,	 GL_LEFT,    GL_RIGHT,
	     GL_FRONT_AND_BACK, and GL_AUXi, where i is between 0 and
	     ``GL_AUX_BUFFERS'' -1, are accepted (GL_AUX_BUFFERS  is  not  the
	     upper  limit;  use  glGet	to  query  the number of available aux
	     buffers.)	The initial value is GL_FRONT for single-buffered con-
	     texts, and GL_BACK for double-buffered contexts.

DESCRIPTION
       When  colors are written to the frame buffer, they are written into the
       color buffers specified by glDrawBuffer.   The  specifications  are  as
       follows:

       GL_NONE			No color buffers are written.

       GL_FRONT_LEFT		Only the front left color buffer is written.

       GL_FRONT_RIGHT		Only  the front right color buffer is written.

       GL_BACK_LEFT		Only the back left color buffer is written.

       GL_BACK_RIGHT		Only the back right color buffer is written.

       GL_FRONT 		Only the front	left  and  front  right  color
				buffers  are  written.	 If  there is no front
				right color buffer, only the front left  color
				buffer is written.

       GL_BACK			Only  the  back  left  and  back  right  color
				buffers are written.   If  there  is  no  back
				right  color  buffer, only the back left color
				buffer is written.

       GL_LEFT			Only  the  front  left	and  back  left  color
				buffers are written.  If there is no back left
				color buffer, only the front left color buffer
				is written.

       GL_RIGHT 		Only  the  front  right  and  back right color
				buffers are written.   If  there  is  no  back
				right color buffer, only the front right color
				buffer is written.

       GL_FRONT_AND_BACK	All the front and back	color  buffers	(front
				left,  front right, back left, back right) are
				written.  If there are no back color  buffers,
				only  the  front  left	and  front right color
				buffers are written.  If there	are  no  right
				color  buffers,  only  the front left and back
				left color buffers are written.  If there  are
				no right or back color buffers, only the front
				left color buffer is written.

       GL_AUXi			Only auxiliary color buffer i is written.

       If more than one color buffer is selected for drawing, then blending or
       logical	operations  are  computed  and	applied independently for each
       color buffer and can produce different results in each buffer.

       Monoscopic contexts include only left buffers,  and  stereoscopic  con-
       texts  include  both left and right buffers.  Likewise, single-buffered
       contexts include  only  front  buffers,	and  double-buffered  contexts
       include	both  front  and  back buffers.  The context is selected at GL
       initialization.

NOTES
       It is always the case that GL_AUXi = GL_AUX0 + i.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if mode is not an accepted value.

       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if none of the buffers  indicated  by
       mode exists.

       GL_INVALID_OPERATION  is  generated if glDrawBuffer is executed between
       the execution of glBegin and the corresponding execution of glEnd.
