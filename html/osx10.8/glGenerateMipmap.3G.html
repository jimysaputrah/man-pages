NAME
       glGenerateMipmap - generate mipmaps for a specified texture target

C SPECIFICATION
       void glGenerateMipmap(GLenum target);

PARAMETERS
       target
	   Specifies the target to which the texture whose mimaps to generate
	   is bound.  target must be GL_TEXTURE_1D, GL_TEXTURE_2D,
	   GL_TEXTURE_3D, GL_TEXTURE_1D_ARRAY, GL_TEXTURE_2D_ARRAY or
	   GL_TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP.

DESCRIPTION
       glGenerateMipmap generates mipmaps for the texture attached to target
       of the active texture unit. For cube map textures, a
       GL_INVALID_OPERATION error is generated if the texture attached to
       target is not cube complete.

       Mipmap generation replaces texel array levels level base + 1 through q
       with arrays derived from the level base array, regardless of their
       previous contents. All other mimap arrays, including the level base
       array, are left unchanged by this computation.

       The internal formats of the derived mipmap arrays all match those of
       the level base array. The contents of the derived arrays are computed
       by repeated, filtered reduction of the level base array. For one- and
       two-dimensional texture arrays, each layer is filtered independently.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if target is not one of the accepted
       texture targets.


       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if target is GL_TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP and
       the texture bound to the GL_TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP target of the active
       texture unit is not cube complete.
