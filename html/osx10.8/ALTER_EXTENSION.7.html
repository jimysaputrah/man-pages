NAME
       ALTER_EXTENSION - change the definition of an extension

SYNOPSIS
       ALTER EXTENSION extension_name UPDATE [ TO new_version ]
       ALTER EXTENSION extension_name SET SCHEMA new_schema
       ALTER EXTENSION extension_name ADD member_object
       ALTER EXTENSION extension_name DROP member_object

       where member_object is:

	 AGGREGATE agg_name (agg_type [, ...] ) |
	 CAST (source_type AS target_type) |
	 COLLATION object_name |
	 CONVERSION object_name |
	 DOMAIN object_name |

	 FOREIGN TABLE object_name |
	 FUNCTION function_name ( [ [ argmode ] [ argname ] argtype [, ...] ] ) |
	 OPERATOR operator_name (left_type, right_type) |
	 OPERATOR CLASS object_name USING index_method |
	 OPERATOR FAMILY object_name USING index_method |
	 [ PROCEDURAL ] LANGUAGE object_name |
	 SCHEMA object_name |
	 SEQUENCE object_name |
	 SERVER object_name |
	 TABLE object_name |
	 TEXT SEARCH CONFIGURATION object_name |

	 VIEW object_name

DESCRIPTION
       ALTER EXTENSION changes the definition of an installed extension. There
       are several subforms:

       UPDATE
	   This form updates the extension to a newer version. The extension
	   must supply a suitable update script (or series of scripts) that
	   can modify the currently-installed version into the requested
	   version.

       SET SCHEMA
	   This form moves the extension's objects into another schema. The
	   extension has to be relocatable for this command to succeed.

       ADD member_object
	   This form adds an existing object to the extension. This is mainly
	   useful in extension update scripts. The object will subsequently be
	   treated as a member of the extension; notably, it can only be
	   dropped by dropping the extension.

       DROP member_object
	   This form removes a member object from the extension. This is
	   mainly useful in extension update scripts. The object is not
	   dropped, only disassociated from the extension.
       See Section 35.15, "Packaging Related Objects into an Extension", in
       the documentation for more information about these operations.

       You must own the extension to use ALTER EXTENSION. The ADD/DROP forms
       require ownership of the added/dropped object as well.

PARAMETERS
       extension_name
	   The name of an installed extension.

       new_version
	   The desired new version of the extension. This can be written as
	   either an identifier or a string literal. If not specified, ALTER
	   EXTENSION UPDATE attempts to update to whatever is shown as the
	   default version in the extension's control file.

       new_schema
	   The new schema for the extension.

       object_name, agg_name, function_name, operator_name
	   The name of an object to be added to or removed from the extension.
	   Names of tables, aggregates, domains, foreign tables, functions,
	   operators, operator classes, operator families, sequences, text
	   search objects, types, and views can be schema-qualified.

       agg_type
	   An input data type on which the aggregate function operates. To
	   reference a zero-argument aggregate function, write * in place of
	   the list of input data types.

       source_type
	   The name of the source data type of the cast.

       target_type
	   The name of the target data type of the cast.

       argmode
	   The mode of a function argument: IN, OUT, INOUT, or VARIADIC. If
	   omitted, the default is IN. Note that ALTER EXTENSION does not
	   actually pay any attention to OUT arguments, since only the input
	   arguments are needed to determine the function's identity. So it is
	   sufficient to list the IN, INOUT, and VARIADIC arguments.

       argname
	   The name of a function argument. Note that ALTER EXTENSION does not
	   actually pay any attention to argument names, since only the
	   argument data types are needed to determine the function's
	   identity.

       argtype
	   The data type(s) of the function's arguments (optionally
	   schema-qualified), if any.

       left_type, right_type
	   The data type(s) of the operator's arguments (optionally
	   schema-qualified). Write NONE for the missing argument of a prefix
	   or postfix operator.

       PROCEDURAL
	   This is a noise word.

EXAMPLES
       To update the hstore extension to version 2.0:

	   ALTER EXTENSION hstore UPDATE TO '2.0';

       To change the schema of the hstore extension to utils:

	   ALTER EXTENSION hstore SET SCHEMA utils;

       To add an existing function to the hstore extension:

	   ALTER EXTENSION hstore ADD FUNCTION populate_record(anyelement, hstore);

COMPATIBILITY
       ALTER EXTENSION is a PostgreSQL extension.
