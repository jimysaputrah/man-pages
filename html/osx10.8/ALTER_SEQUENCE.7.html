ALTER SEQUENCE(7)	PostgreSQL 9.1.4 Documentation	     ALTER SEQUENCE(7)



NAME
       ALTER_SEQUENCE - change the definition of a sequence generator

SYNOPSIS
       ALTER SEQUENCE name [ INCREMENT [ BY ] increment ]
	   [ MINVALUE minvalue | NO MINVALUE ] [ MAXVALUE maxvalue | NO MAXVALUE ]
	   [ START [ WITH ] start ]
	   [ RESTART [ [ WITH ] restart ] ]
	   [ CACHE cache ] [ [ NO ] CYCLE ]
	   [ OWNED BY { table.column | NONE } ]
       ALTER SEQUENCE name OWNER TO new_owner
       ALTER SEQUENCE name RENAME TO new_name
       ALTER SEQUENCE name SET SCHEMA new_schema

DESCRIPTION
       ALTER SEQUENCE changes the parameters of an existing sequence
       generator. Any parameters not specifically set in the ALTER SEQUENCE
       command retain their prior settings.

       You must own the sequence to use ALTER SEQUENCE. To change a sequence's
       schema, you must also have CREATE privilege on the new schema. To alter
       the owner, you must also be a direct or indirect member of the new
       owning role, and that role must have CREATE privilege on the sequence's
       schema. (These restrictions enforce that altering the owner doesn't do
       anything you couldn't do by dropping and recreating the sequence.
       However, a superuser can alter ownership of any sequence anyway.)

PARAMETERS
       name
	   The name (optionally schema-qualified) of a sequence to be altered.

       increment
	   The clause INCREMENT BY increment is optional. A positive value
	   will make an ascending sequence, a negative one a descending
	   sequence. If unspecified, the old increment value will be
	   maintained.

       minvalue, NO MINVALUE
	   The optional clause MINVALUE minvalue determines the minimum value
	   a sequence can generate. If NO MINVALUE is specified, the defaults
	   of 1 and -263-1 for ascending and descending sequences,
	   respectively, will be used. If neither option is specified, the
	   current minimum value will be maintained.

       maxvalue, NO MAXVALUE
	   The optional clause MAXVALUE maxvalue determines the maximum value
	   for the sequence. If NO MAXVALUE is specified, the defaults are
	   263-1 and -1 for ascending and descending sequences, respectively,
	   will be used. If neither option is specified, the current maximum
	   value will be maintained.

       start
	   The optional clause START WITH start changes the recorded start
	   value of the sequence. This has no effect on the current sequence
	   value; it simply sets the value that future ALTER SEQUENCE RESTART
	   commands will use.

       restart
	   The optional clause RESTART [ WITH restart ] changes the current
	   value of the sequence. This is equivalent to calling the setval
	   function with is_called = false: the specified value will be
	   returned by the next call of nextval. Writing RESTART with no
	   restart value is equivalent to supplying the start value that was
	   recorded by CREATE SEQUENCE or last set by ALTER SEQUENCE START
	   WITH.

       cache
	   The clause CACHE cache enables sequence numbers to be preallocated
	   and stored in memory for faster access. The minimum value is 1
	   (only one value can be generated at a time, i.e., no cache). If
	   unspecified, the old cache value will be maintained.

       CYCLE
	   The optional CYCLE key word can be used to enable the sequence to
	   wrap around when the maxvalue or minvalue has been reached by an
	   ascending or descending sequence respectively. If the limit is
	   reached, the next number generated will be the minvalue or
	   maxvalue, respectively.

       NO CYCLE
	   If the optional NO CYCLE key word is specified, any calls to
	   nextval after the sequence has reached its maximum value will
	   return an error. If neither CYCLE or NO CYCLE are specified, the
	   old cycle behavior will be maintained.

       OWNED BY table.column, OWNED BY NONE
	   The OWNED BY option causes the sequence to be associated with a
	   specific table column, such that if that column (or its whole
	   table) is dropped, the sequence will be automatically dropped as
	   well. If specified, this association replaces any previously
	   specified association for the sequence. The specified table must
	   have the same owner and be in the same schema as the sequence.
	   Specifying OWNED BY NONE removes any existing association, making
	   the sequence "free-standing".

       new_owner
	   The user name of the new owner of the sequence.

       new_name
	   The new name for the sequence.

       new_schema
	   The new schema for the sequence.

NOTES
       To avoid blocking of concurrent transactions that obtain numbers from
       the same sequence, ALTER SEQUENCE's effects on the sequence generation
       parameters are never rolled back; those changes take effect immediately
       and are not reversible. However, the OWNED BY, OWNER TO, RENAME TO, and
       SET SCHEMA clauses cause ordinary catalog updates that can be rolled
       back.


       ALTER SEQUENCE will not immediately affect nextval results in backends,
       other than the current one, that have preallocated (cached) sequence
       values. They will use up all cached values prior to noticing the
       changed sequence generation parameters. The current backend will be
       affected immediately.


       ALTER SEQUENCE does not affect the currval status for the sequence.
       (Before PostgreSQL 8.3, it sometimes did.)

       For historical reasons, ALTER TABLE can be used with sequences too; but
       the only variants of ALTER TABLE that are allowed with sequences are
       equivalent to the forms shown above.

EXAMPLES
       Restart a sequence called serial, at 105:

	   ALTER SEQUENCE serial RESTART WITH 105;

COMPATIBILITY
       ALTER SEQUENCE conforms to the SQL standard, except for the START WITH,
       OWNED BY, OWNER TO, RENAME TO, and SET SCHEMA clauses, which are
       PostgreSQL extensions.
