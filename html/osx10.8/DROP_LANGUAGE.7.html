DROP LANGUAGE(7)	PostgreSQL 9.1.4 Documentation	      DROP LANGUAGE(7)



NAME
       DROP_LANGUAGE - remove a procedural language

SYNOPSIS
       DROP [ PROCEDURAL ] LANGUAGE [ IF EXISTS ] name [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ]

DESCRIPTION
       DROP LANGUAGE removes the definition of a previously registered
       procedural language. You must be a superuser or the owner of the
       language to use DROP LANGUAGE.

	   Note
	   As of PostgreSQL 9.1, most procedural languages have been made into
	   "extensions", and should therefore be removed with DROP EXTENSION
	   (DROP_EXTENSION(7)) not DROP LANGUAGE.

PARAMETERS
       IF EXISTS
	   Do not throw an error if the language does not exist. A notice is
	   issued in this case.

       name
	   The name of an existing procedural language. For backward
	   compatibility, the name can be enclosed by single quotes.

       CASCADE
	   Automatically drop objects that depend on the language (such as
	   functions in the language).

       RESTRICT
	   Refuse to drop the language if any objects depend on it. This is
	   the default.

EXAMPLES
       This command removes the procedural language plsample:

	   DROP LANGUAGE plsample;

COMPATIBILITY
       There is no DROP LANGUAGE statement in the SQL standard.

SEE ALSO
       ALTER LANGUAGE (ALTER_LANGUAGE(7)), CREATE LANGUAGE
       (CREATE_LANGUAGE(7)), droplang(1)
