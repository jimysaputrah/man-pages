NAME
       glDrawElementsInstancedBaseVertex - render multiple instances of a set
       of primitives from array data with a per-element offset

C SPECIFICATION
       void glDrawElementsInstancedBaseVertex(GLenum mode, GLsizei count,
					      GLenum type, GLvoid *indices,
					      GLsizei primcount,
					      GLint basevertex);

PARAMETERS
       mode
	   Specifies what kind of primitives to render. Symbolic constants
	   GL_POINTS, GL_LINE_STRIP, GL_LINE_LOOP, GL_LINES,
	   GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP, GL_TRIANGLE_FAN, and GL_TRIANGLES are accepted.

       count
	   Specifies the number of elements to be rendered.

       type
	   Specifies the type of the values in indices. Must be one of
	   GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT, or GL_UNSIGNED_INT.

       indices
	   Specifies a pointer to the location where the indices are stored.

       primcount
	   Specifies the number of instances of the indexed geometry that
	   should be drawn.

       basevertex
	   Specifies a constant that should be added to each element of
	   indices when chosing elements from the enabled vertex arrays.

DESCRIPTION
       glDrawElementsInstancedBaseVertex behaves identically to
       glDrawElementsInstanced() except that the ith element transferred by
       the corresponding draw call will be taken from element indices[i] +
       basevertex of each enabled array. If the resulting value is larger than
       the maximum value representable by type, it is as if the calculation
       were upconverted to 32-bit unsigned integers (with wrapping on overflow
       conditions). The operation is undefined if the sum would be negative.

NOTES
       glDrawElementsInstancedBaseVertex is only supported if the GL version
       is 3.2 or greater.
	   .SH "ERRORS"


       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if mode is not an accepted value.


       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if count or primcount is negative.


       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if a geometry shader is active and
       mode is incompatible with the input primitive type of the geometry
       shader in the currently installed program object.


       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if a non-zero buffer object name is
       bound to an enabled array or the element array and the buffer object's
       data store is currently mapped.
