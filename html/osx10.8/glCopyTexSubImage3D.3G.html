NAME
       glCopyTexSubImage3D - copy a three-dimensional texture subimage

C SPECIFICATION
       void glCopyTexSubImage3D(GLenum target, GLint level, GLint xoffset,
				GLint yoffset, GLint zoffset, GLint x,
				GLint y, GLsizei width, GLsizei height);


PARAMETERS
       target
	   Specifies the target texture. Must be GL_TEXTURE_3D

       level
	   Specifies the level-of-detail number. Level 0 is the base image
	   level. Level n is the nth mipmap reduction image.

       xoffset
	   Specifies a texel offset in the x direction within the texture
	   array.

       yoffset
	   Specifies a texel offset in the y direction within the texture
	   array.

       zoffset
	   Specifies a texel offset in the z direction within the texture
	   array.

       x, y
	   Specify the window coordinates of the lower left corner of the
	   rectangular region of pixels to be copied.

       width
	   Specifies the width of the texture subimage.

       height
	   Specifies the height of the texture subimage.

DESCRIPTION
       glCopyTexSubImage3D replaces a rectangular portion of a
       three-dimensional texture image with pixels from the current
       GL_READ_BUFFER (rather than from main memory, as is the case for
       glTexSubImage3D()).

       The screen-aligned pixel rectangle with lower left corner at (x, y) and
       with width width and height height replaces the portion of the texture
       array with x indices xoffset through xoffset + width - 1, inclusive,
       and y indices yoffset through yoffset + height - 1, inclusive, at z
       index zoffset and at the mipmap level specified by level.

       The pixels in the rectangle are processed exactly as if glReadPixels()
       had been called, but the process stops just before final conversion. At
       this point, all pixel component values are clamped to the range 0 1 and
       then converted to the texture's internal format for storage in the
       texel array.

       The destination rectangle in the texture array may not include any
       texels outside the texture array as it was originally specified. It is
       not an error to specify a subtexture with zero width or height, but
       such a specification has no effect.

       If any of the pixels within the specified rectangle of the current
       GL_READ_BUFFER are outside the read window associated with the current
       rendering context, then the values obtained for those pixels are
       undefined.

       No change is made to the internalformat, width, height, depth, or
       border parameters of the specified texture array or to texel values
       outside the specified subregion.

NOTES
       glPixelStore() modes affect texture images.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if /target is not GL_TEXTURE_3D.


       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if the texture array has not been
       defined by a previous glTexImage3D() operation.


       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if level is less than 0.


       GL_INVALID_VALUE may be generated if level > log 2 ai max, where max is
       the returned value of GL_MAX_3D_TEXTURE_SIZE.


       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if xoffset < - b, xoffset + width > w -
       b, yoffset < - b, yoffset + height > h - b, zoffset < - b, or zoffset +
       1 > d - b, where w is the GL_TEXTURE_WIDTH, h is the GL_TEXTURE_HEIGHT,
       d is the GL_TEXTURE_DEPTH, and b is the GL_TEXTURE_BORDER of the
       texture image being modified. Note that w, h, and d include twice the
       border width.
