NAME
       DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::ODBC::Microsoft_SQL_Server - Support
       specific to Microsoft SQL Server over ODBC

DESCRIPTION
       This class implements support specific to Microsoft SQL Server over
       ODBC.  It is loaded automatically by by DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::ODBC
       when it detects a MSSQL back-end.

       Most of the functionality is provided from the superclass
       DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::MSSQL.

USAGE NOTES
   Basic Linux Setup (Debian)
	 sudo aptitude install tdsodbc libdbd-odbc-perl unixodbc

       In case it is not already there put the following in
       "/etc/odbcinst.ini":

	 [FreeTDS]
	 Description = FreeTDS
	 Driver      = /usr/lib/odbc/libtdsodbc.so
	 Setup	     = /usr/lib/odbc/libtdsS.so
	 UsageCount  = 1

       Set your $dsn in connect_info as follows:

	 dbi:ODBC:server=<my.host.name>;port=1433;driver=FreeTDS;tds_version=8.0

       If you use the EasySoft driver (<http://www.easysoft.com>):

	 dbi:ODBC:server=<my.host.name>;port=1433;driver=Easysoft ODBC-SQL Server

   Basic Windows Setup
       Use the following $dsn for the Microsoft ODBC driver:

	 dbi:ODBC:driver={SQL Server};server=SERVER\SQL_SERVER_INSTANCE_NAME

       And for the Native Client:

	 dbi:ODBC:driver={SQL Server Native Client 10.0};server=SERVER\SQL_SERVER_INSTANCE_NAME

       Go into Control Panel -> System and Security -> Administrative Tools ->
       Data Sources (ODBC) to check driver names and to set up data sources.

       Use System DSNs, not User DSNs if you want to use DSNs.

       If you set up a DSN, use the following $dsn for connect_info:

	 dbi:ODBC:dsn=MY_DSN

MULTIPLE ACTIVE STATEMENTS
       The following options are alternative ways to enable concurrent
       executing statement support. Each has its own advantages and drawbacks
       and works on different platforms. Read each section carefully.

       In order of preference, they are:

       o       mars

       o       dynamic_cursors

       o       server_cursors

METHODS
   connect_call_use_mars
       Use as:

	 on_connect_call => 'use_mars'

       in your connection info, or alternatively specify it directly:

	 Your::Schema->connect (
	   $original_dsn . '; MARS_Connection=Yes',
	   $user,
	   $pass,
	   \%attrs,
	 )

       Use to enable a feature of SQL Server 2005 and later, "Multiple Active
       Result Sets". See "Does DBD::ODBC support Multiple Active Statements?"
       in DBD::ODBC::FAQ for more information.

       This does not work on FreeTDS drivers at the time of this writing, and
       only works with the Native Client, later versions of the Windows MS
       ODBC driver, and the Easysoft driver.

   connect_call_use_dynamic_cursors
       Use as:

	 on_connect_call => 'use_dynamic_cursors'

       Which will add "odbc_cursortype => 2" to your DBI connection
       attributes, or alternatively specify the necessary flag directly:

	 Your::Schema->connect (@dsn, { ... odbc_cursortype => 2 })

       See "odbc_cursortype" in DBD::ODBC for more information.

       If you're using FreeTDS, "tds_version" must be set to at least 8.0.

       This will not work with CODE ref connect_info's.

       WARNING: on FreeTDS (and maybe some other drivers) this will break
       "SCOPE_IDENTITY()", and "SELECT @@IDENTITY" will be used instead, which
       on SQL Server 2005 and later will return erroneous results on tables
       which have an on insert trigger that inserts into another table with an
       "IDENTITY" column.

       WARNING: on FreeTDS, changes made in one statement (e.g. an insert) may
       not be visible from a following statement (e.g. a select.)

   connect_call_use_server_cursors
       Use as:

	 on_connect_call => 'use_server_cursors'

       May allow multiple active select statements. See "odbc_SQL_ROWSET_SIZE"
       in DBD::ODBC for more information.

       Takes an optional parameter for the value to set the attribute to,
       default is 2.

       WARNING: this does not work on all versions of SQL Server, and may lock
       up your database!

       At the time of writing, this option only works on Microsoft's Windows
       drivers, later versions of the ODBC driver and the Native Client
       driver.

   using_freetds
       Tries to determine, to the best of our ability, whether or not you are
       using the FreeTDS driver with DBD::ODBC.
