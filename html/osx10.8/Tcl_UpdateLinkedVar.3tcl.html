DESCRIPTION
       Tcl_LinkVar uses variable traces to keep the Tcl variable named by var-
       Name in sync with the C variable at the address given by  addr.	 When-
       ever  the  Tcl  variable  is  read  the value of the C variable will be
       returned, and whenever the Tcl variable is written the C variable  will
       be  updated  to	have  the  same  value.   Tcl_LinkVar normally returns
       TCL_OK;	if an error occurs while setting up  the  link	(e.g.  because
       varName is the name of array) then TCL_ERROR is returned and the inter-
       preter's result contains an error message.

       The type argument specifies the type of the C variable, and  must  have
       one of the following values, optionally OR'ed with TCL_LINK_READ_ONLY:

       TCL_LINK_INT
	      The  C  variable is of type int.	Any value written into the Tcl
	      variable must have a proper integer form acceptable to  Tcl_Get-
	      IntFromObj;   attempts  to write non-integer values into varName
	      will be rejected with Tcl errors. 			       |

       TCL_LINK_UINT							       ||
	      The  C variable is of type unsigned int.	Any value written into |
	      the Tcl variable	must  have  a  proper  unsigned  integer  form |
	      acceptable   to  Tcl_GetWideIntFromObj  and  in  the  platform's |
	      defined range for the unsigned int type; attempts to write  non- |
	      integer  values  (or values outside the range) into varName will |
	      be rejected with Tcl errors.				       |

       TCL_LINK_CHAR							       ||
	      The  C variable is of type char.	Any value written into the Tcl |
	      variable must have a proper integer form acceptable to  Tcl_Get- |
	      IntFromObj and be in the range of the char datatype; attempts to |
	      write non-integer or out-of-range values into  varName  will  be |
	      rejected with Tcl errors. 				       |

       TCL_LINK_UCHAR							       ||
	      The C variable is of type unsigned char.	Any value written into |
	      the  Tcl	variable  must	have  a  proper  unsigned integer form |
	      acceptable to Tcl_GetIntFromObj and in  the  platform's  defined |
	      range  for the unsigned char type; attempts to write non-integer |
	      values (or values  outside  the  range)  into  varName  will  be |
	      rejected with Tcl errors. 				       |

       TCL_LINK_SHORT							       ||
	      The C variable is of type short.	Any value written into the Tcl |
	      variable	must have a proper integer form acceptable to Tcl_Get- |
	      IntFromObj and be in the range of the short  datatype;  attempts |
	      to write non-integer or out-of-range values into varName will be |
	      rejected with Tcl errors. 				       |

       TCL_LINK_USHORT							       ||
	      The  C  variable	is  of type unsigned short.  Any value written |
	      into the Tcl variable must have a proper unsigned  integer  form |
	      acceptable  to  Tcl_GetIntFromObj  and in the platform's defined |
	      range for the unsigned short type; attempts to write non-integer |
	      values  (or  values  outside  the  range)  into  varName will be |
	      rejected with Tcl errors. 				       |

       TCL_LINK_LONG							       ||
	      The  C variable is of type long.	Any value written into the Tcl |
	      variable must have a proper integer form acceptable to  Tcl_Get- |
	      LongFromObj;  attempts to write non-integer or out-of-range val- |
	      ues into varName will be rejected with Tcl errors.	       |

       TCL_LINK_ULONG							       ||
	      The C variable is of type unsigned long.	Any value written into |
	      the Tcl variable	must  have  a  proper  unsigned  integer  form |
	      acceptable   to  Tcl_GetWideIntFromObj  and  in  the  platform's |
	      defined range for the unsigned long type; attempts to write non- |
	      integer  values  (or values outside the range) into varName will |
	      be rejected with Tcl errors.

       TCL_LINK_DOUBLE
	      The C variable is of type double.  Any value  written  into  the
	      Tcl variable must have a proper real form acceptable to Tcl_Get-
	      DoubleFromObj;  attempts to write non-real values  into  varName
	      will be rejected with Tcl errors. 			       |

       TCL_LINK_FLOAT							       ||
	      The C variable is of type float.	Any value written into the Tcl |
	      variable	must have a proper real form acceptable to Tcl_GetDou- |
	      bleFromObj and must be within the range acceptable for a	float; |
	      attempts	to write non-real values (or values outside the range) |
	      into varName will be rejected with Tcl errors.

       TCL_LINK_WIDE_INT
	      The C variable is of type Tcl_WideInt (which is an integer  type
	      at  least  64-bits  wide	on all platforms that can support it.)
	      Any value written into the Tcl variable must have a proper inte-
	      ger form acceptable to Tcl_GetWideIntFromObj;  attempts to write
	      non-integer values  into	varName  will  be  rejected  with  Tcl
	      errors.							       |

       TCL_LINK_WIDE_UINT						       ||
	      The C variable is of type Tcl_WideUInt  (which  is  an  unsigned |
	      integer  type  at  least	64-bits wide on all platforms that can |
	      support it.)  Any value written into the Tcl variable must  have |
	      a  proper unsigned integer form acceptable to Tcl_GetWideIntFro- |
	      mObj (it will be cast to unsigned); attempts to write  non-inte- |
	      ger values into varName will be rejected with Tcl errors.

       TCL_LINK_BOOLEAN
	      The  C  variable	is  of type int.  If its value is zero then it
	      will read from Tcl as "0"; otherwise it will read  from  Tcl  as
	      "1".   Whenever  varName is modified, the C variable will be set
	      to a 0 or 1 value.  Any value written into the Tcl variable must
	      have  a proper boolean form acceptable to Tcl_GetBooleanFromObj;
	      attempts to  write  non-boolean  values  into  varName  will  be
	      rejected with Tcl errors.

       TCL_LINK_STRING
	      The C variable is of type char *.  If its value is not NULL then
	      it must be a pointer to a string	allocated  with  Tcl_Alloc  or
	      ckalloc.	 Whenever  the	Tcl variable is modified the current C
	      string will be freed and new memory will be allocated to hold  a
	      copy  of the variable's new value.  If the C variable contains a
	      NULL pointer then the Tcl variable will read as "NULL".

       If the TCL_LINK_READ_ONLY flag is present in  type  then  the  variable
       will  be  read-only  from Tcl, so that its value can only be changed by
       modifying the C variable.  Attempts to write the variable from Tcl will
       be rejected with errors.

       Tcl_UnlinkVar removes the link previously set up for the variable given
       by varName.  If there does not exist a link for varName then the proce-
       dure has no effect.

       Tcl_UpdateLinkedVar  may be invoked after the C variable has changed to
       force the Tcl variable to be updated immediately.  In many  cases  this
       procedure  is  not  needed,  since any attempt to read the Tcl variable
       will return the latest value of the C variable.	However,  if  a  trace
       has  been  set  on the Tcl variable (such as a Tk widget that wishes to
       display the value of the variable), the trace will not trigger when the
       C variable has changed.	Tcl_UpdateLinkedVar ensures that any traces on
       the Tcl variable are invoked.
