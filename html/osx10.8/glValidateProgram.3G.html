NAME
       glValidateProgram - Validates a program object

C SPECIFICATION
       void glValidateProgram(GLuint program);

PARAMETERS
       program
	   Specifies the handle of the program object to be validated.

DESCRIPTION
       glValidateProgram checks to see whether the executables contained in
       program can execute given the current OpenGL state. The information
       generated by the validation process will be stored in program's
       information log. The validation information may consist of an empty
       string, or it may be a string containing information about how the
       current program object interacts with the rest of current OpenGL state.
       This provides a way for OpenGL implementers to convey more information
       about why the current program is inefficient, suboptimal, failing to
       execute, and so on.

       The status of the validation operation will be stored as part of the
       program object's state. This value will be set to GL_TRUE if the
       validation succeeded, and GL_FALSE otherwise. It can be queried by
       calling glGetProgram() with arguments program and GL_VALIDATE_STATUS.
       If validation is successful, program is guaranteed to execute given the
       current state. Otherwise, program is guaranteed to not execute.

       This function is typically useful only during application development.
       The informational string stored in the information log is completely
       implementation dependent; therefore, an application should not expect
       different OpenGL implementations to produce identical information
       strings.

NOTES
       This function mimics the validation operation that OpenGL
       implementations must perform when rendering commands are issued while
       programmable shaders are part of current state. The error
       GL_INVALID_OPERATION will be generated by any command that triggers the
       rendering of geometry if:

       o   any two active samplers in the current program object are of
	   different types, but refer to the same texture image unit,

       o   the number of active samplers in the program exceeds the maximum
	   number of texture image units allowed.

       It may be difficult or cause a performance degradation for applications
       to catch these errors when rendering commands are issued. Therefore,
       applications are advised to make calls to glValidateProgram to detect
       these issues during application development.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if program is not a value generated by
       OpenGL.

       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if program is not a program object.

ASSOCIATED GETS
       glGetProgram() with arguments program and GL_VALIDATE_STATUS

       glGetProgramInfoLog() with argument program

       glIsProgram()
