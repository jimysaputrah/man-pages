NAME
       DBD::File - Base class for writing file based DBI drivers

SYNOPSIS
       This module is a base class for writing other DBDs.  It is not intended
       to function as a DBD itself (though it is possible).  If you want to
       access flat files, use DBD::AnyData, or DBD::CSV (both of which are
       subclasses of DBD::File).

DESCRIPTION
       The DBD::File module is not a true DBI driver, but an abstract base
       class for deriving concrete DBI drivers from it. The implication is,
       that these drivers work with plain files, for example CSV files or INI
       files. The module is based on the SQL::Statement module, a simple SQL
       engine.

       See DBI for details on DBI, SQL::Statement for details on
       SQL::Statement and DBD::CSV, DBD::DBM or DBD::AnyData for example
       drivers.

   Metadata
       The following attributes are handled by DBI itself and not by
       DBD::File, thus they all work as expected:

	   Active
	   ActiveKids
	   CachedKids
	   CompatMode		  (Not used)
	   InactiveDestroy
	   AutoInactiveDestroy
	   Kids
	   PrintError
	   RaiseError
	   Warn 		  (Not used)

       The following DBI attributes are handled by DBD::File:

       AutoCommit

       Always on.

       ChopBlanks

       Works.

       NUM_OF_FIELDS

       Valid after "$sth->execute".

       NUM_OF_PARAMS

       Valid after "$sth->prepare".

       NAME

       Valid after "$sth->execute"; undef for Non-Select statements.

       NULLABLE

       Not really working, always returns an array ref of ones, except the
       affected table has been created in this session.  Valid after
       "$sth->execute"; undef for non-select statements.

       The following DBI attributes and methods are not supported:

       bind_param_inout
       CursorName
       LongReadLen
       LongTruncOk

       DBD::File specific attributes

       In addition to the DBI attributes, you can use the following dbh
       attributes:

       f_dir

       This attribute is used for setting the directory where the files are
       opened and it defaults to the current directory (.). Usually you set it
       on the dbh but it may be overridden per table (see f_meta).

       When the value for "f_dir" is a relative path, it is converted into the
       appropriate absolute path name (based on the current working directory)
       when the dbh attribute is set.

       See "KNOWN BUGS AND LIMITATIONS".

       f_ext

       This attribute is used for setting the file extension. The format is:

	 extension{/flag}

       where the /flag is optional and the extension is case-insensitive.
       "f_ext" allows you to specify an extension which:

       o   makes DBD::File prefer table.extension over table.

       o   makes the table name the filename minus the extension.

	   DBI:CSV:f_dir=data;f_ext=.csv

       In the above example and when "f_dir" contains both table.csv and
       table, DBD::File will open table.csv and the table will be named
       "table". If table.csv does not exist but table does that file is opened
       and the table is also called "table".

       If "f_ext" is not specified and table.csv exists it will be opened and
       the table will be called "table.csv" which is probably not what you
       want.

       NOTE: even though extensions are case-insensitive, table names are not.

	   DBI:CSV:f_dir=data;f_ext=.csv/r

       The "r" flag means the file extension is required and any filename that
       does not match the extension is ignored.

       Usually you set it on the dbh but it may be overridden per table (see
       f_meta).

       f_schema

       This will set the schema name and defaults to the owner of the
       directory in which the table file resides. You can set "f_schema" to
       "undef".

	   my $dbh = DBI->connect ("dbi:CSV:", "", "", {
	       f_schema => undef,
	       f_dir	=> "data",
	       f_ext	=> ".csv/r",
	       }) or die $DBI::errstr;

       By setting the schema you affect the results from the tables call:

	   my @tables = $dbh->tables ();

	   # no f_schema
	   "merijn".foo
	   "merijn".bar

	   # f_schema => "dbi"
	   "dbi".foo
	   "dbi".bar

	   # f_schema => undef
	   foo
	   bar

       Defining "f_schema" to the empty string is equal to setting it to
       "undef" so the DSN can be "dbi:CSV:f_schema=;f_dir=.".

       f_lock

       The "f_lock" attribute is used to set the locking mode on the opened
       table files. Note that not all platforms support locking.  By default,
       tables are opened with a shared lock for reading, and with an exclusive
       lock for writing. The supported modes are:

	 0: No locking at all.

	 1: Shared locks will be used.

	 2: Exclusive locks will be used.

       But see KNOWN BUGS below.

       f_lockfile

       If you wish to use a lockfile extension other than ".lck", simply
       specify the "f_lockfile" attribute:

	 $dbh = DBI->connect ("dbi:DBM:f_lockfile=.foo");
	 $dbh->{f_lockfile} = ".foo";
	 $dbh->{f_meta}{qux}{f_lockfile} = ".foo";

       If you wish to disable locking, set the "f_lockfile" to 0.

	 $dbh = DBI->connect ("dbi:DBM:f_lockfile=0");
	 $dbh->{f_lockfile} = 0;
	 $dbh->{f_meta}{qux}{f_lockfile} = 0;

       f_encoding

       With this attribute, you can set the encoding in which the file is
       opened.	This is implemented using "binmode $fh,
       ":encoding(<f_encoding>)"".

       f_meta

       Private data area which contains information about the tables this
       module handles. Table meta data might not be available until the table
       has been accessed for the first time e.g., by issuing a select on it
       however it is possible to pre-initialize attributes for each table you
       use.

       DBD::File recognizes the (public) attributes "f_ext", "f_dir",
       "f_file", "f_encoding", "f_lock", "f_lockfile", "f_schema",
       "col_names", "table_name" and "sql_identifier_case". Be very careful
       when modifying attributes you do not know, the consequence might be a
       destroyed or corrupted table.

       "f_file" is an attribute applicable to table meta data only and you
       will not find a corresponding attribute in the dbh. Whilst it may be
       reasonable to have several tables with the same column names, it is not
       for the same file name. If you need access to the same file using
       different table names, use "SQL::Statement" as the SQL engine and the
       "AS" keyword:

	   SELECT * FROM tbl AS t1, tbl AS t2 WHERE t1.id = t2.id

       "f_file" can be an absolute path name or a relative path name but if it
       is relative, it is interpreted as being relative to the "f_dir"
       attribute of the table meta data. When "f_file" is set DBD::File will
       use "f_file" as specified and will not attempt to work out an
       alternative for "f_file" using the "table name" and "f_ext" attribute.

       While "f_meta" is a private and readonly attribute (which means, you
       cannot modify it's values), derived drivers might provide restricted
       write access through another attribute. Well known accessors are
       "csv_tables" for DBD::CSV, "ad_tables" for DBD::AnyData and
       "dbm_tables" for DBD::DBM.

       Internally private attributes to deal with SQL backends:

       Do not modify any of these private attributes unless you understand the
       implications of doing so. The behavior of DBD::File and derived DBDs
       might be unpredictable when one or more of those attributes are
       modified.

       sql_nano_version

       Contains the version of loaded DBI::SQL::Nano.

       sql_statement_version

       Contains the version of loaded SQL::Statement.

       sql_handler

       Contains either the text 'SQL::Statement' or 'DBI::SQL::Nano'.

       sql_ram_tables

       Contains optionally temporary tables.

       sql_flags

       Contains optional flags to instantiate the SQL::Parser parsing engine
       when SQL::Statement is used as SQL engine. See SQL::Parser for valid
       flags.

   Driver private methods
       Default DBI methods

       data_sources

       The "data_sources" method returns a list of subdirectories of the
       current directory in the form "dbi:CSV:f_dir=$dirname".

       If you want to read the subdirectories of another directory, use

	   my ($drh)  = DBI->install_driver ("CSV");
	   my (@list) = $drh->data_sources (f_dir => "/usr/local/csv_data");

       list_tables

       This method returns a list of file names inside $dbh->{f_dir}.
       Example:

	   my ($dbh)  = DBI->connect ("dbi:CSV:f_dir=/usr/local/csv_data");
	   my (@list) = $dbh->func ("list_tables");

       Note that the list includes all files contained in the directory, even
       those that have non-valid table names, from the view of SQL.

       Additional methods

       The following methods are only available via their documented name when
       DBD::File is used directly. Because this is only reasonable for testing
       purposes, the real names must be used instead. Those names can be
       computed by replacing the "f_" in the method name with the driver
       prefix.

       f_versions

       Signature:

	   sub f_versions (;$)
	   {
	       my ($table_name) = @_;
	       $table_name ||= ".";
	       ...
	   }

       Returns the versions of the driver, including the DBI version, the Perl
       version, DBI::PurePerl version (if DBI::PurePerl is active) and the
       version of the SQL engine in use.

	   my $dbh = DBI->connect ("dbi:File:");
	   my $f_versions = $dbh->f_versions ();
	   print "$f_versions\n";
	   __END__
	   # DBD::File	      0.39 using SQL::Statement 1.28
	   # DBI	      1.612
	   # OS 	      netbsd (5.99.24)
	   # Perl	      5.010001 (x86_64-netbsd-thread-multi)

       Called in list context, f_versions will return an array containing each
       line as single entry.

       Some drivers might use the optional (table name) argument and modify
       version information related to the table (e.g. DBD::DBM provides
       storage backend information for the requested table, when it has a
       table name).

       f_get_meta

       Signature:

	   sub f_get_meta ($$)
	   {
	       my ($table_name, $attrib) = @_;
	       ...
	   }

       Returns the value of a meta attribute set for a specific table, if any.
       See f_meta for the possible attributes.

       A table name of "." (single dot) is interpreted as the default table.
       This will retrieve the appropriate attribute globally from the dbh.
       This has the same restrictions as "$dbh->{$attrib}".

       f_set_meta

       Signature:

	   sub f_set_meta ($$$)
	   {
	       my ($table_name, $attrib, $value) = @_;
	       ...
	   }

       Sets the value of a meta attribute set for a specific table.  See
       f_meta for the possible attributes.

       A table name of "." (single dot) is interpreted as the default table
       which will set the specified attribute globally for the dbh.  This has
       the same restrictions as "$dbh->{$attrib} = $value".

       f_clear_meta

       Signature:

	   sub f_clear_meta ($)
	   {
	       my ($table_name) = @_;
	       ...
	   }

       Clears the table specific meta information in the private storage of
       the dbh.

SQL ENGINES
       DBD::File currently supports two SQL engines: SQL::Statement and
       DBI::SQL::Nano::Statement_. DBI::SQL::Nano supports a very limited
       subset of SQL statements, but it might be faster for some very simple
       tasks. SQL::Statement in contrast supports a much larger subset of ANSI
       SQL.

       To use SQL::Statement, you need at least version 1.28 of SQL::Statement
       and the environment variable "DBI_SQL_NANO" must not be set to a true
       value.

KNOWN BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
       o   This module uses flock () internally but flock is not available on
	   all platforms. On MacOS and Windows 95 there is no locking at all
	   (perhaps not so important on MacOS and Windows 95, as there is only
	   a single user).

       o   The module stores details about the handled tables in a private
	   area of the driver handle ($drh). This data area is not shared
	   between different driver instances, so several "DBI->connect ()"
	   calls will cause different table instances and private data areas.

	   This data area is filled for the first time when a table is
	   accessed, either via an SQL statement or via "table_info" and is
	   not destroyed until the table is dropped or the driver handle is
	   released.  Manual destruction is possible via f_clear_meta.

	   The following attributes are preserved in the data area and will
	   evaluated instead of driver globals:

	   f_ext
	   f_dir
	   f_lock
	   f_lockfile
	   f_encoding
	   f_schema
	   col_names
	   sql_identifier_case

	   The following attributes are preserved in the data area only and
	   cannot be set globally.

	   f_file

	   The following attributes are preserved in the data area only and
	   are computed when initializing the data area:

	   f_fqfn
	   f_fqbn
	   f_fqln
	   table_name

	   For DBD::CSV tables this means, once opened "foo.csv" as table
	   named "foo", another table named "foo" accessing the file "foo.txt"
	   cannot be opened.  Accessing "foo" will always access the file
	   "foo.csv" in memorized "f_dir", locking "f_lockfile" via memorized
	   "f_lock".

	   You can use f_clear_meta or the "f_file" attribute for a specific
	   table to work around this.

       o   When used with SQL::Statement and temporary tables e.g.,

	     CREATE TEMP TABLE ...

	   the table data processing bypasses DBD::File::Table. No file system
	   calls will be made and there are no clashes with existing (file
	   based) tables with the same name. Temporary tables are chosen over
	   file tables, but they will not covered by "table_info".
