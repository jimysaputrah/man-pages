SIGPROCMASK(2)		    BSD System Calls Manual		SIGPROCMASK(2)

NAME
     sigprocmask -- manipulate current signal mask

SYNOPSIS
     #include &ltsignal.h&gt

     int
     sigprocmask(int how, const sigset_t *restrict set,
	 sigset_t *restrict oset);

DESCRIPTION
     The sigprocmask() function examines and/or changes the current signal
     mask (those signals that are blocked from delivery).  Signals are blocked
     if they are members of the current signal mask set.

     If set is not null, the action of sigprocmask() depends on the value of
     the parameter how.  The signal mask is changed as a function of the spec-
     ified set and the current mask.  The function is specified by how using
     one of the following values from &ltsignal.h&gt:

     SIG_BLOCK	  The new mask is the union of the current mask and the speci-
		  fied set.

     SIG_UNBLOCK  The new mask is the intersection of the current mask and the
		  complement of the specified set.

     SIG_SETMASK  The current mask is replaced by the specified set.

     If oset is not null, it is set to the previous value of the signal mask.
     When set is null, the value of how is insignificant and the mask remains
     unset providing a way to examine the signal mask without modification.

     The system quietly disallows SIGKILL or SIGSTOP to be blocked.

RETURN VALUES
     A 0 value indicated that the call succeeded.  A -1 return value indicates
     an error occurred and errno is set to indicated the reason.

ERRORS
     The sigprocmask() call will fail and the signal mask will be unchanged if
     one of the following occurs:

     [EINVAL]		how has a value other than those listed here.

SEE ALSO
     kill(2), sigaction(2), sigsuspend(2), sigsetops(3)

STANDARDS
     The sigprocmask() function call is expected to conform to IEEE Std
     1003.1-1988 (``POSIX.1'').
