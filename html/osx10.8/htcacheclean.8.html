NAME
       htcacheclean - Clean up the disk cache


SYNOPSIS
       htcacheclean [ -D ] [ -v ] [ -t ] [ -r ] [ -n ] -ppath -llimit


       htcacheclean [ -n ] [ -t ] [ -i ] -dinterval -ppath -llimit



SUMMARY
       htcacheclean  is  used  to  keep  the  size of mod_disk_cache's storage
       within a certain limit. This tool can run either manually or in	daemon
       mode.  When  running  in  daemon  mode, it sleeps in the background and
       checks the cache directories at regular intervals for cached content to
       be removed. You can stop the daemon cleanly by sending it a TERM or INT
       signal.



OPTIONS
       -dinterval
	      Daemonize and repeat cache cleaning every interval minutes. This
	      option  is mutually exclusive with the -D, -v and -r options. To
	      shutdown the daemon cleanly, just send it a SIGTERM or SIGINT.

       -D     Do a dry run and don't delete anything. This option is  mutually
	      exclusive with the -d option.

       -v     Be  verbose and print statistics. This option is mutually exclu-
	      sive with the -d option.

       -r     Clean thoroughly. This assumes that the Apache web server is not
	      running  (otherwise  you	may  get  garbage  in the cache). This
	      option is mutually exclusive with the -d option and implies  the
	      -t option.

       -n     Be  nice.  This causes slower processing in favour of other pro-
	      cesses. htcacheclean will sleep from time to time  so  that  (a)
	      the  disk  IO  will  be  delayed and (b) the kernel can schedule
	      other processes in the meantime.

       -t     Delete all empty directories. By default only  cache  files  are
	      removed,	however  with  some configurations the large number of
	      directories created may require attention. If your configuration
	      requires	a  very large number of directories, to the point that
	      inode or file allocation table exhaustion may become  an	issue,
	      use of this option is advised.

       -ppath Specify  path  as  the  root  directory  of the disk cache. This
	      should be the same value as specified with the CacheRoot	direc-
	      tive.

       -llimit
	      Specify  limit  as the total disk cache size limit. The value is
	      expressed in bytes by default (or attaching B  to  the  number).
	      Attach K for Kbytes or M for MBytes.

       -i     Be intelligent and run only when there was a modification of the
	      disk cache. This option is only possible together  with  the  -d
	      option.


EXIT STATUS
       htcacheclean returns a zero status ("true") if all operations were suc-
       cessful, 1 otherwise.
