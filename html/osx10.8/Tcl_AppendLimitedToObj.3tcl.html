DESCRIPTION
       The  procedures	described in this manual entry allow Tcl objects to be
       manipulated as string values.  They use the internal representation  of
       the object to store additional information to make the string manipula-
       tions more efficient.  In particular, they  make  a  series  of	append
       operations  efficient  by allocating extra storage space for the string
       so that it does not have to be copied for each append.  Also,  indexing
       and length computations are optimized because the Unicode string repre-
       sentation  is  calculated  and  cached  as  needed.   When  using   the
       Tcl_Append*  family  of functions where the interpreter's result is the
       object being appended to, it is important to call Tcl_ResetResult first
       to ensure you are not unintentionally appending to existing data in the
       result object.

       Tcl_NewStringObj and Tcl_SetStringObj create a new object or modify  an
       existing object to hold a copy of the string given by bytes and length.
       Tcl_NewUnicodeObj and Tcl_SetUnicodeObj create a new object  or	modify
       an  existing  object to hold a copy of the Unicode string given by uni-
       code and numChars.  Tcl_NewStringObj  and  Tcl_NewUnicodeObj  return  a
       pointer	to a newly created object with reference count zero.  All four
       procedures set the object to hold  a  copy  of  the  specified  string.
       Tcl_SetStringObj  and Tcl_SetUnicodeObj free any old string representa-
       tion as well as any old internal representation of the object.

       Tcl_GetStringFromObj and Tcl_GetString return an object's string repre-
       sentation.   This  is  given  by  the  returned	byte  pointer and (for
       Tcl_GetStringFromObj) length, which is stored in  lengthPtr  if	it  is
       non-NULL.   If  the  object's UTF string representation is invalid (its
       byte pointer is NULL), the string representation  is  regenerated  from
       the  object's  internal	representation.  The storage referenced by the
       returned byte pointer is owned by the object  manager.	It  is	passed
       back  as a writable pointer so that extension author creating their own
       Tcl_ObjType will be able to modify the string representation within the
       Tcl_UpdateStringProc  of  their	Tcl_ObjType.   Except for that limited
       purpose, the pointer returned by Tcl_GetStringFromObj or  Tcl_GetString
       should be treated as read-only.	It is recommended that this pointer be
       assigned to a (const char *) variable.  Even in the limited  situations
       where  writing  to  this pointer is acceptable, one should take care to
       respect the copy-on-write semantics required by Tcl_Obj's, with	appro-
       priate calls to Tcl_IsShared and Tcl_DuplicateObj prior to any in-place
       modification of the string representation.  The procedure Tcl_GetString
       is used in the common case where the caller does not need the length of
       the string representation.

       Tcl_GetUnicodeFromObj and Tcl_GetUnicode return an object's value as  a
       Unicode	string.   This	is  given  by  the  returned  pointer and (for
       Tcl_GetUnicodeFromObj) length, which is stored in lengthPtr  if	it  is
       non-NULL.  The storage referenced by the returned byte pointer is owned
       by the object manager and should not be modified by  the  caller.   The
       procedure  Tcl_GetUnicode  is  used in the common case where the caller
       does not need the length of the unicode string representation.

       Tcl_GetUniChar returns the index'th character in the  object's  Unicode
       representation.

       Tcl_GetRange returns a newly created object comprised of the characters
       between first and last (inclusive) in the object's Unicode  representa-
       tion.   If  the object's Unicode representation is invalid, the Unicode
       representation is regenerated from the object's string  representation.

       Tcl_GetCharLength  returns  the	number	of  characters	(as opposed to
       bytes) in the string object.

       Tcl_AppendToObj appends the data given  by  bytes  and  length  to  the
       string representation of the object specified by objPtr.  If the object
       has an invalid string representation, then an attempt is made  to  con-
       vert  bytes is to the Unicode format.  If the conversion is successful,
       then the converted form of bytes is appended to	the  object's  Unicode
       representation.	 Otherwise,  the  object's  Unicode  representation is
       invalidated and converted to the UTF format, and bytes is  appended  to
       the object's new string representation.

       Tcl_AppendUnicodeToObj  appends the Unicode string given by unicode and
       numChars to the object specified by  objPtr.   If  the  object  has  an
       invalid	Unicode  representation,  then unicode is converted to the UTF
       format and appended to the object's string representation.  Appends are
       optimized to handle repeated appends relatively efficiently (it overal-
       locates the string or Unicode space to avoid repeated reallocations and
       copies of object's string value).

       Tcl_AppendObjToObj  is  similar	to Tcl_AppendToObj, but it appends the
       string or Unicode value (whichever exists and  is  best	suited	to  be
       appended to objPtr) of appendObjPtr to objPtr.

       Tcl_AppendStringsToObj is similar to Tcl_AppendToObj except that it can
       be passed more than one value to append and each value must be a  null-
       terminated  string  (i.e.  none of the values may contain internal null
       characters).  Any number of string arguments may be provided,  but  the
       last argument must be a NULL pointer to indicate the end of the list.

       Tcl_AppendStringsToObjVA  is  the same as Tcl_AppendStringsToObj except
       that instead of taking a variable number of arguments it takes an argu-
       ment list.

       Tcl_AppendLimitedToObj  is  similar  to	Tcl_AppendToObj except that it |
       imposes a limit on how many bytes are appended.	This can be handy when |
       the string to be appended might be very large, but the value being con- |
       structed should not be allowed to grow without bound. A common usage is |
       when constructing an error message, where the end result should be kept |
       short enough to be read.  Bytes from bytes are appended to objPtr,  but |
       no  more  than  limit bytes total are to be appended. If the limit pre- |
       vents all length bytes that are available from being appended, then the |
       appending  is  done so that the last bytes appended are from the string |
       ellipsis. This allows for an indication of the truncation to be left in |
       the string.  When length is -1, all bytes up to the first zero byte are |
       appended, subject to the limit. When  ellipsis  is  NULL,  the  default |
       string ... is used. When ellipsis is non-NULL, it must point to a zero- |
       byte-terminated string in Tcl's internal UTF encoding.  The  number  of |
       bytes  appended	can  be  less than the lesser of length and limit when |
       appending fewer bytes is necessary  to  append  only  whole  multi-byte |
       characters.							       |

       Tcl_Format  is  the  C-level interface to the engine of the format com- |
       mand.  The actual command procedure for format is little more than      |
	      Tcl_Format(interp, Tcl_GetString(objv[1]), objc-2, objv+2);      |
       The objc Tcl_Obj values in objv are formatted into a  string  according |
       to the conversion specification in format argument, following the docu- |
       mentation for the format command.  The resulting  formatted  string  is |
       converted to a new Tcl_Obj with refcount of zero and returned.  If some |
       error happens during  production  of  the  formatted  string,  NULL  is |
       returned, and an error message is recorded in interp, if interp is non- |
       NULL.								       |

       Tcl_AppendFormatToObj is an appending alternative  form	of  Tcl_Format |
       with functionality equivalent to 				       |
	      Tcl_Obj *newPtr = Tcl_Format(interp, format, objc, objv);        |
	      if (newPtr == NULL) return TCL_ERROR;			       |
	      Tcl_AppendObjToObj(objPtr, newPtr);			       |
	      return TCL_OK;						       |
       but  with  greater  convenience and efficiency when the appending func- |
       tionality is needed.						       |

       Tcl_ObjPrintf serves as a replacement for the common sequence	       |
	      char buf[SOME_SUITABLE_LENGTH];				       |
	      sprintf(buf, format, ...);				       |
	      Tcl_NewStringObj(buf, -1);				       |
       but with greater  convenience  and  no  need  to  determine  SOME_SUIT- |
       ABLE_LENGTH.  The  formatting  is  done	with  the same core formatting |
       engine used by Tcl_Format.  This means the set of supported  conversion |
       specifiers  is  that  of the format command and not that of the sprintf |
       routine where the two sets differ. When a conversion  specifier	passed |
       to  Tcl_ObjPrintf  includes a precision, the value is taken as a number |
       of bytes, as sprintf does, and not as a number of characters, as format |
       does.   This  is  done  on the assumption that C code is more likely to |
       know how many bytes it is passing around than  the  number  of  encoded |
       characters  those  bytes  happen  to represent.	The variable number of |
       arguments passed in should be of the types that would be  suitable  for |
       passing to sprintf.  Note in this example usage, x is of type long.     |
	      long x = 5;						       |
	      Tcl_Obj *objPtr = Tcl_ObjPrintf("Value is %d", x);	       |
       If  the	value  of  format contains internal inconsistencies or invalid |
       specifier  formats,   the   formatted   string	result	 produced   by |
       Tcl_ObjPrintf will be an error message describing the error.	       |

       Tcl_AppendPrintfToObj is an appending alternative form of Tcl_ObjPrintf |
       with functionality equivalent to 				       |
	      Tcl_AppendObjToObj(objPtr, Tcl_ObjPrintf(format, ...));	       |
       but with greater convenience and efficiency when  the  appending  func- |
       tionality is needed.

       The  Tcl_SetObjLength  procedure changes the length of the string value
       of its objPtr argument.	If the newLength argument is greater than  the
       space allocated for the object's string, then the string space is real-
       located and the old value is copied to the new space; the bytes between
       the old length of the string and the new length may have arbitrary val-
       ues.  If the newLength argument is less than the current length of  the
       object's  string,  with	objPtr-&gtlength is reduced without reallocating
       the string space;  the  original  allocated  size  for  the  string  is
       recorded  in the object, so that the string length can be enlarged in a
       subsequent call to Tcl_SetObjLength without reallocating  storage.   In
       all    cases    Tcl_SetObjLength    leaves    a	 null	character   at
       objPtr-&gtbytes[newLength].

       Tcl_AttemptSetObjLength is identical in	function  to  Tcl_SetObjLength
       except that if sufficient memory to satisfy the request cannot be allo-
       cated, it does not cause  the  Tcl  interpreter	to  panic.   Thus,  if
       newLength  is greater than the space allocated for the object's string,
       and there is not  enough  memory  available  to	satisfy  the  request,
       Tcl_AttemptSetObjLength	will  take  no action and return 0 to indicate
       failure.   If  there  is  enough  memory  to   satisfy	the   request,
       Tcl_AttemptSetObjLength	behaves just like Tcl_SetObjLength and returns
       1 to indicate success.

       The Tcl_ConcatObj function returns a new string object whose  value  is
       the  space-separated concatenation of the string representations of all
       of the objects in the objv array. Tcl_ConcatObj eliminates leading  and
       trailing  white	space  as  it copies the string representations of the
       objv array to the result. If an element of the objv array  consists  of
       nothing	but  white  space,  then that object is ignored entirely. This
       white-space removal was added to make the output of the concat  command
       cleaner-looking.  Tcl_ConcatObj	returns  a  pointer to a newly-created
       object whose ref count is zero.
