NAME
     fdesetup -- FileVault enabling tool

SYNOPSIS
     fdesetup verb [options]

DESCRIPTION
     fdesetup is used to enable or disable FileVault, to list enabled File-
     Vault users, or to add additional users after FileVault has already been
     enabled. When enabling FileVault, the tool can return a recovery key.
     FileVault can also be set up with an institutional recovery key.

     Data passed in via stdin should be a property list using the example for-
     mat below. When enabling FileVault, the top level Username and Password
     key values must be an existing user. When disabling and when adding addi-
     tional users, the top level Username key is ignored, and the Password key
     value should either be an existing FileVault user password or the recov-
     ery key. If a password is not in the dictionary, the tool will prompt for
     it. Username parameters should be short names of existing users.

     With the -keychain option, an institutional recovery key can be set up by
     placing an X.509 asymmetric public certificate in the /Library/Key-
     chains/FileVaultMaster.keychain file. security create-filevaultmaster-
     keychain can be used to create the keychain. Alternatively a certificate
     can be passed in by using the -certificate option and entering the path
     to the DER encoded certificate file. In this case the FileVaultMas-
     ter.keychain file will be created using the certificate.

     If you do not want a recovery key returned, use the -norecoverykey
     option. This should only be used when an institutional recovery key has
     been configured.

     The list command will display the short names and UUIDs of any enabled
     FileVault users. The remove command will remove a user from FileVault.

     The syncusers command synchronizes Open Directory attributes (e.g. user
     pictures) with FileVault users, and removes FileVault users that were
     removed from Open Directory. It does not add users to FileVault.

     On supported hardware, fdesetup allows allows restart of a FileVault-
     enabled system without requiring unlock during the subsequent boot. WARN-
     ING: FileVault protections are reduced during authenticated restarts. In
     particular, fdesetup deliberately stores at least one additional copy of
     a permanent FDE unlock key in both system memory and (on supported sys-
     tems) the System Management Controller (SMC).  fdesetup must be run as
     root and itself prompts for a password to unlock the FileVault root vol-
     ume.  Once authenticated, it launches reboot(8) which, upon successful
     unlock, will remove the unlock key.

OPTIONS
     -defer file_path
	     Defer enabling FileVault until the user password is obtained, and
	     recovery key and system information will be written to the file
	     path.

     -user user_shortname
	     Short user name.

     -uuid user_uuid
	     User UUID in canonical form:
	     11111111-2222-3333-4444-555555555555.

     -usertoadd added_user
	     Additional user(s) to be added to FileVault.

     -inputplist
	     Acquire configuration information from stdin when enabling or
	     adding users to FileVault.

     -prompt
	     Always prompt for information.

     -forcerestart
	     Force a normal restart after FileVault has been successfully con-
	     figured.

     -outputplist
	     Outputs the recovery key and additional system information to
	     stdout.

     -keychain
	     Use the institutional recovery key stored in /Library/Key-
	     chains/FileVaultMaster.keychain.

     -certificate path_to_cer_file
	     Use the certificate data located at the path. Any existing
	     /Library/Keychains/FileVaultMaster.keychain file will be moved
	     away with the location logged in the system log.

     -norecoverykey
	     Do not return a recovery key.

DEFERRED ENABLEMENT
     The -defer option can be used with the enable command option to delay
     enabling FileVault until after the current (or next) user logs out, thus
     avoiding the need to enter a password when the tool is run. The user will
     be prompted at logout time for the password, at which point an attempt
     will be made to enable FileVault. If the volume is not already a
     CoreStorage volume, the system may need to be restarted to start the
     encryption process. Logout dialogs are automatically dismissed and can-
     celed after 60 seconds if no interaction occurs and the user will be
     prompted again at the next logout time.

     The -defer option sets up a single user to be added to FileVault. If
     there was no user specified (e.g. without the -user option), then the
     currently logged in user will be added to the configuration and becomes
     the designated user. If there is no user specified and no users are
     logged in at the time of configuration, then the next user that logs in
     will be used as the designated user.

     As recovery key information is not generated until the user password is
     obtained, the -defer option requires a path where this information will
     be written to. The property list file will be created as a root-only
     readable file and should be placed in a secure location.

     Options that can be used in conjunction with the -defer option include:
     -keychain, -certificate, -user, and -norecoverykey.

     Note that if the designated user doesn't complete the set-up at logout,
     FileVault will not be enabled, and the configuration will remain and be
     used again for the designated user's next logout, thereby 'nagging' the
     user to enable FileVault. To remove an active deferred enablement config-
     uration, use the disable command.

EXAMPLES
     fdesetup enable -user sally -usertoadd johnny -usertoadd henry
	      -outputplist &gt /secureplace/mykeyinfo.plist
	      Enables FileVault, adds users sally, johnny and henry to the EFI
	      login, and outputs the recovery key and other information into
	      the file.  Note that the user sally here does not have more
	      privileges than the other added users.

     fdesetup enable -keychain -norecoverykey
	      Enables FileVault using an institutional recovery key in the
	      FileVaultMaster.keychain file. No personal recovery key will be
	      created.

     fdesetup enable -defer /MykeyAndInfo.plist
	      Enables FileVault when the current user logs out and success-
	      fully enters their password and then writes the personal recov-
	      ery key and other relevant information to the file.

     fdesetup enable -certificate /mycertfile.cer
	      Enables FileVault with an institutional recovery key based off
	      the certificate data in the DER encoded file. A FileVaultMas-
	      ter.keychain file will be created automatically.

     fdesetup enable -inputplist &lt /someinfo.plist
	      Enables FileVault using information from the property list read
	      in from stdin.

     fdesetup status
	      Shows the current status of FileVault.

     fdesetup list
	      Lists the current FileVault users.

     fdesetup remove -uuid A6C75639-1D98-4F19-ACD5-1892BAE27991
	      Removes the user with the UUID from the FileVault users list.

     fdesetup isactive
	      Returns with exit status zero if FileVault is enabled and
	      active.

     fdesetup add -usertoadd betty
	      Adds the user betty to the existing FileVault setup.

EXIT STATUS
     The exit status of the tool is set to indicate whether any error was
     detected. The values returned are:

     0			No error, or successful operation.

     1			FileVault is Off.

     2			FileVault appears to be On but Busy.

     11 		Authentication error.

     12 		Parameter error.

     13 		Unknown command error.

     14 		Bad command error.

     16 		Legacy FileVault error.

     17 		Added users failed error.

     18 		Unexpected keychain found error.

     19 		Keychain error. This usually means the FileVaultMaster
			keychain could not be moved or replaced.

     20 		Deferred configuration setup error.

     21 		Enable failed (Keychain) error.

     22 		Enable failed (CoreStorage) error.
