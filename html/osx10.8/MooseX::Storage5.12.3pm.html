NAME
       MooseX::Storage - A serialization framework for Moose classes

SYNOPSIS
	 package Point;
	 use Moose;
	 use MooseX::Storage;

	 our $VERSION = '0.01';

	 with Storage('format' =&gt 'JSON', 'io' =&gt 'File');

	 has 'x' =&gt (is =&gt 'rw', isa =&gt 'Int');
	 has 'y' =&gt (is =&gt 'rw', isa =&gt 'Int');

	 1;

	 my $p = Point-&gtnew(x =&gt 10, y =&gt 10);

	 ## methods to pack/unpack an
	 ## object in perl data structures

	 # pack the class into a hash
	 $p-&gtpack(); # { __CLASS__ =&gt 'Point-0.01', x =&gt 10, y =&gt 10 }

	 # unpack the hash into a class
	 my $p2 = Point-&gtunpack({ __CLASS__ =&gt 'Point-0.01', x =&gt 10, y =&gt 10 });

	 ## methods to freeze/thaw into
	 ## a specified serialization format
	 ## (in this case JSON)

	 # pack the class into a JSON string
	 $p-&gtfreeze(); # { "__CLASS__" : "Point-0.01", "x" : 10, "y" : 10 }

	 # unpack the JSON string into a class
	 my $p2 = Point-&gtthaw('{ "__CLASS__" : "Point-0.01", "x" : 10, "y" : 10 }');

	 ## methods to load/store a class
	 ## on the file system

	 $p-&gtstore('my_point.json');

	 my $p2 = Point-&gtload('my_point.json');

DESCRIPTION
       MooseX::Storage is a serialization framework for Moose, it provides a
       very flexible and highly pluggable way to serialize Moose classes to a
       number of different formats and styles.

   Important Note
       This is still an early release of this module, so use with caution.
       It's outward facing serialization API should be considered stable, but
       I still reserve the right to make tweaks if I need too. Anything beyond
       the basic pack/unpack, freeze/thaw and load/store should not be relied
       on.

   Levels of Serialization
       There are 3 levels to the serialization, each of which builds upon the
       other and each of which can be customized to the specific needs of your
       class.

       base
	   The first (base) level is "pack" and "unpack". In this level the
	   class is serialized into a Perl HASH reference, it is tagged with
	   the class name and each instance attribute is stored. Very simple.

	   This level is not optional, it is the bare minumum that
	   MooseX::Storage provides and all other levels build on top of this.

	   See MooseX::Storage::Basic for the fundamental implementation and
	   options to "pack" and "unpack"

       format
	   The second (format) level is "freeze" and "thaw". In this level the
	   output of "pack" is sent to "freeze" or the output of "thaw" is
	   sent to "unpack". This levels primary role is to convert to and
	   from the specific serialization format and Perl land.

	   This level is optional, if you don't want/need it, you don't have
	   to have it. You can just use "pack"/"unpack" instead.

       io  The third (io) level is "load" and "store". In this level we are
	   reading and writing data to file/network/database/etc.

	   This level is also optional, in most cases it does require a
	   "format" role to also be used, the exception being the
	   "StorableFile" role.

   Behaviour modifiers
       The serialization behaviour can be changed by supplying "traits".  This
       can be done as follows:

	 use MooseX::Storage;
	 with Storage( traits =&gt [Trait1, Trait2,...] );

       The following traits are currently bundled with "MooseX::Storage":

       OnlyWhenBuilt
	   Only attributes that have been built (ie, where the predicate
	   returns 'true') will be serialized. This avoids any potentially
	   expensive computations.

	   See MooseX::Storage::Traits::OnlyWhenBuilt for details.

   How we serialize
       There are always limits to any serialization framework, there are just
       some things which are really difficult to serialize properly and some
       things which cannot be serialized at all.

   What can be serialized?
       Currently only numbers, string, ARRAY refs, HASH refs and other
       MooseX::Storage enabled objects are supported.

       With Array and Hash references the first level down is inspected and
       any objects found are serialized/deserialized for you. We do not do
       this recusively by default, however this feature may become an option
       eventually.

       The specific serialize/deserialize routine is determined by the Moose
       type constraint a specific attribute has. In most cases subtypes of the
       supported types are handled correctly, and there is a facility for
       adding handlers for custom types as well. This will get documented
       eventually, but it is currently still in development.

   What can not be serialized?
       We do not support CODE references yet, but this support might be added
       in using B::Deparse or some other deep magic.

       Scalar refs are not supported, mostly because there is no way to know
       if the value being referenced will be there when the object is
       inflated.  I highly doubt will be ever support this in a general sense,
       but it would be possible to add this yourself for a small specific
       case.

       Circular references are specifically disallowed, however if you break
       the cycles yourself then re-assemble them later you can get around
       this.  The reason we disallow circular refs is because they are not
       always supported in all formats we use, and they tend to be very tricky
       to do for all possible cases. It is almost always something you want to
       have tight control over anyway.

CAVEAT
       This is not a persistence framework; changes to your object after you
       load or store it will not be reflected in the stored class.

EXPORTS
       Storage (%options)
	   This module will export the "Storage" method and can be used to
	   load a specific set of MooseX::Storage roles to implement a
	   specific combination of features. It is meant to make things
	   easier, but it is by no means the only way. You can still compose
	   your roles by hand if you like.

	   By default, options are assumed to be short forms.  For example,
	   this:

	     Storage(format =&gt 'JSON');

	   ...will result in looking for MooseX::Storage::Format::JSON.  To
	   use a role that is not under the default namespace prefix, start
	   with an equal sign:

	     Storage(format =&gt '=My::Private::JSONFormat');

	   To use a parameterized role (for which, see
	   MooseX::Role::Parameterized) you can pass an arrayref of the role
	   name (in short or long form, as above) and its parameters:

	     Storage(format =&gt [ JSONpm =&gt { json_opts =&gt { pretty =&gt 1 } } ]);

METHODS
       import

       meta

TODO
       This module needs docs and probably a Cookbook of some kind as well.
       This is an early release, so that is my excuse for now :)

       For the time being, please read the tests and feel free to email me if
       you have any questions. This module can also be discussed on IRC in the
       #moose channel on irc.perl.org.

BUGS
       All complex software has bugs lurking in it, and this module is no
       exception. If you find a bug please either email me, or add the bug to
       cpan-RT.
