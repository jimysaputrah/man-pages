NAME
       Time::Epoch - Convert between Perl epoch and other epochs

SYNOPSIS
	 #!/usr/bin/perl -wl
	 use Time::Epoch;
	 my $perlsec  = 966770660;  # Sun Aug 20 07:24:21 2000 -0400 on Mac OS
	 my $epochsec = perl2epoch($perlsec, 'macos', '-0400');
	 my $perlsec2 = epoch2perl($epochsec, 'macos', '-0400');

	 print $perlsec;
	 print $perlsec2;
	 print $epochsec;
	 # correct time on Unix:
	 print scalar localtime $perlsec;
	 # correct time on Mac OS (-0400):
	 print scalar localtime $epochsec;

DESCRIPTION
       Exports two functions, "perl2epoch" and "epoch2perl".  Currently only
       goes between Perl (Unix) epoch and Mac OS epoch.  This is in
       preparation for an eventual move of Perl to its own universal epoch, so
       we can get the system epoch of any platform that differs from Perl's.

   Epochs
       o   macos

	   Takes additional optional parameter of time zone differential.  If
	   time zone differential not supplied, we guess by getting the
	   different between "localtime" and "gmtime" with
	   <Time::Local::timelocal>.

BUGS
       o   Hm.	With the above test, "scalar localtime $perlsec" under my
	   Linux box and "scalar localtime $epochsec" under my Mac OS box are
	   off by one second from each other.  Maybe a leap second thing?
	   Odd.
