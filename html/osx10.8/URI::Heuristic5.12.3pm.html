NAME
       URI::Heuristic - Expand URI using heuristics

SYNOPSIS
	use URI::Heuristic qw(uf_uristr);
	$u = uf_uristr("perl"); 	    # http://www.perl.com
	$u = uf_uristr("www.sol.no/sol");   # http://www.sol.no/sol
	$u = uf_uristr("aas");		    # http://www.aas.no
	$u = uf_uristr("ftp.funet.fi");     # ftp://ftp.funet.fi
	$u = uf_uristr("/etc/passwd");	    # file:/etc/passwd

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides functions that expand strings into real absolute
       URIs using some built-in heuristics.  Strings that already represent
       absolute URIs (i.e. that start with a "scheme:" part) are never
       modified and are returned unchanged.  The main use of these functions
       is to allow abbreviated URIs similar to what many web browsers allow
       for URIs typed in by the user.

       The following functions are provided:

       uf_uristr($str)
	   Tries to make the argument string into a proper absolute URI
	   string.  The "uf_" prefix stands for "User Friendly".  Under MacOS,
	   it assumes that any string with a common URL scheme (http, ftp,
	   etc.) is a URL rather than a local path.  So don't name your
	   volumes after common URL schemes and expect uf_uristr() to
	   construct valid file: URL's on those volumes for you, because it
	   won't.

       uf_uri($str)
	   Works the same way as uf_uristr() but returns a "URI" object.

ENVIRONMENT
       If the hostname portion of a URI does not contain any dots, then
       certain qualified guesses are made.  These guesses are governed by the
       following environment variables:

       COUNTRY	 The two-letter country code (ISO 3166) for your location.  If
		 the domain name of your host ends with two letters, then it
		 is taken to be the default country. See also Locale::Country.

       HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE, LC_ALL, LANG
		 If COUNTRY is not set, these standard environment variables
		 are examined and country (not language) information possibly
		 found in them is used as the default country.

       URL_GUESS_PATTERN
		 Contains a space-separated list of URL patterns to try.  The
		 string "ACME" is for some reason used as a placeholder for
		 the host name in the URL provided.  Example:

		  URL_GUESS_PATTERN="www.ACME.no www.ACME.se www.ACME.com"
		  export URL_GUESS_PATTERN

		 Specifying URL_GUESS_PATTERN disables any guessing rules
		 based on country.  An empty URL_GUESS_PATTERN disables any
		 guessing that involves host name lookups.
