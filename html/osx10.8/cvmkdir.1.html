NAME
       cvmkdir - Create an Xsan Directory with an Affinity

SYNOPSIS
       cvmkdir [ -k key ] dirname


DESCRIPTION
       The  cvmkdir  command creates a Xsan File System directory and attaches
       an affinity parameter (key) to it.  If no option is used and the direc-
       tory  exists, the cvmkdir command displays the assigned affinity.  Once
       an affinity is assigned to a directory, it cannot be  altered.	If  no
       key  is	specified and the directory does not exist, the directory will
       not be created.

       An affinity may be dissociated from a directory by specifying an  empty
       key (e.g., "").

       See snfs_config(5) for details about affinities to storage pools.

USAGE
       key  specifies  to  the file system what affinity to associate with the
       directory.  All new sub-directories  and  files	created  beneath  this
       directory  inherit its affinity.  If the affinity is changed or removed
       only files or directories created after the change are affected.

       dirname is the path of the directory to be created.
