NAME
       perl5115delta - what is new for perl v5.11.5

DESCRIPTION
       This document describes differences between the 5.11.4 release and the
       5.11.5 release.

       If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.11.3, first read
       perl5114delta, which describes differences between 5.11.3 and 5.11.4.

Core Enhancements
   32-bit limit on substr arguments removed
       The 32-bit limit on "substr" arguments has now been removed. The full
       range of the system's signed and unsigned integers is now available for
       the "pos" and "len" arguments.

Modules and Pragmata
   Pragmata Changes
       "version"
	   Upgraded from version 0.81 to 0.82.

	   The "is_lax" and "is_strict" functions can now be optionally
	   exported to the caller's namespace and are also now documented.

	   Undefined version objects are now uninitialized with zero rather
	   than "undef".

   Updated Modules
       "B::Debug"
	   Upgraded from version 1.11 to 1.12.

       "CPAN"
	   Upgraded from version 1.94_53 to 1.94_56.

	   This resolves RT #72362, in which CPAN was ignoring
	   "configure_requires", and RT #72348, in which the command "o conf
	   init" in the CPAN shell could cause an exception to be thrown.

	   This module is also now built in a less specialized way, which
	   resolves a problem that caused "make" after "make clean" to fail,
	   fixing RT #72218.

       "CPANPLUS::Dist::Build"
	   Upgraded from version 0.44 to 0.46.

	   This makes the prereq resolving fall back to _build/ querying if
	   the "prereq_data" action fails.

       "Pod::Perldoc"
	   Upgraded from version 3.15_01 to 3.15_02.

       "Pod::Plainer"
	   Upgraded from version 1.01 to 1.02.

       "Safe"
	   Upgraded from version 2.21 to 2.22.

	   This resolves RT #72700, in which an exception thrown from a
	   closure was getting lost.

       "Socket"
	   Upgraded from version 1.85 to 1.86.

	   This makes the new Socket implementation of "inet_pton" consistent
	   with the existing Socket6 implementation of "inet_pton", fixing RT
	   #72884.

       "podlators"
	   Upgraded from version 2.2.2 to 2.3.1.

Changes to Existing Documentation
       The syntax "unless (EXPR) BLOCK else BLOCK" is now documented as valid,
       as is the syntax "unless (EXPR) BLOCK elsif (EXPR) BLOCK ... else
       BLOCK", although actually using the latter may not be the best idea for
       the readability of your source code.

Installation and Configuration Improvements
   Configuration improvements
       Support for SystemTap's "dtrace" compatibility layer has been added and
       an issue with linking "miniperl" has been fixed in the process.

       "less -R" is now used instead of "less" for "groff"'s new usage of ANSI
       escape codes by setting $Config{less} (and thereby $Config{pager},
       which fixes RT #72156.

       USE_PERL_ATOF is now reported in the compile-time options listed by the
       "-V" switch.

Selected Bug Fixes
       o   Arbitrary whitespace is now allowed between "NAME" and "VERSION" in
	   "package NAME VERSION;" statements. (Fixes RT #72432)

       o   A panic caused by trying to load "charnames" when the parser is
	   already in error (e.g. by a missing "my" under "use strict;") is
	   now averted. This was a regression since Perl 5.10.0. (Fixes RT
	   #72590)

       o   Reading $! no longer causes a SEGV for out of range "errno" values.
	   (Fixes RT #72850)

       o   A possible SEGV in "/\N{...}/" has been fixed. This was a
	   regression since Perl 5.10.

       o   A possible SEGV when freeing a scalar that was upgraded to an
	   "SVt_REGEXP" type from a simple(r) scalar has been fixed.

       o   A type conversion bug in "gmtime64" that caused it to break around
	   "2**48" has been fixed.

       o   Interpolating a regex that makes use of the "charnames" pragma will
	   no longer cause a run-time error. (Fixes RT #56444)

       o   Array references assigned to *Foo::ISA now have the necessary magic
	   added to them to catch any further updates to the new @ISA. (Fixes
	   RT #72866)

       o   Filehandles are now always blessed into "IO::File", which, together
	   with some suitable manipulation of @IO::File::ISA, fixes a breakage
	   introduced in Perl 5.11.3 by a change that always blessed
	   filehandles into "IO::Handle" rather than checking for "FileHandle"
	   first.

       o   A change in the behaviour of "warnings::enabled" and
	   "warnings::warnif" in Perl 5.10.0 that wasn't documented at the
	   time is now documented in perl5100delta. (Fixes RT #62522)

       o   RT #71504 is now fixed by simply skipping the tests that failed on
	   OpenBSD with ithreads and perlio.

New or Changed Diagnostics
       o   The fatal error "Malformed UTF-8 returned by \N" is now produced if
	   the "charnames" handler returns malformed UTF-8.

       o   If an unresolved named character or sequence was encountered when
	   compiling a regex pattern then the fatal error "\\N{NAME} must be
	   resolved by the lexer" is now produced. This can happen, for
	   example, when using a single-quotish context like "$re =
	   '\N{SPACE}'; $re;". See perldiag for more examples of how the lexer
	   can get bypassed.

       o   The fatal error "Invalid hexadecimal number in \\N{U+...}" will be
	   produced if the character constant represented by "..." is not a
	   valid hexadecimal number.

       o   The new meaning of "\N" as "[^\n]" is not valid in a bracketed
	   character class, just like "." in a character class loses its
	   special meaning, and will cause the fatal error "\\N in a character
	   class must be a named character: \\N{...}".

       o   The rules on what is legal for the "..." in "\N{...}" have been
	   tightened up so that unless the "..." begins with an alphabetic
	   character and continues with a combination of alphanumerics,
	   dashes, spaces, parentheses or colons then the warning "Deprecated
	   character(s) in \\N{...} starting at '%s'" is now issued.

       o   The warning "Using just the first characters returned by \N{}" will
	   be issued if the "charnames" handler returns a sequence of
	   characters which exceeds the limit of the number of characters that
	   can be used. The message will indicate which characters were used
	   and which were discarded.

       o   Currently, all but the first of the several characters that the
	   "charnames" handler may return are discarded when used in a regular
	   expression pattern bracketed character class. If this happens then
	   the warning "Using just the first character returned by \N{} in
	   character class" will be issued.

       o   The warning "Missing right brace on \\N{} or unescaped left brace
	   after \\N.  Assuming the latter" will be issued if Perl encounters
	   a "\N{" but doesn't find a matching "}". In this case Perl doesn't
	   know if it was mistakenly omitted, or if "match non-newline"
	   followed by "match a "{"" was desired.  It assumes the latter
	   because that is actually a valid interpretation as written, unlike
	   the other case.  If you meant the former, you need to add the
	   matching right brace.  If you did mean the latter, you can silence
	   this warning by writing instead "\N\{".

       o   "gmtime" and "localtime" called with numbers smaller than they can
	   reliably handle will now issue the warnings "gmtime(%.0f) too
	   small" and "localtime(%.0f) too small".

New Tests
       t/op/filehandle.t
	   Tests some suitably portable filetest operators to check that they
	   work as expected, particularly in the light of some internal
	   changes made in how filehandles are blessed.

       t/op/time_loop.t
	   Tests that times greater than "2**63", which can now be handed to
	   "gmtime" and "localtime", do not cause an internal overflow or an
	   excessively long loop.

Known Problems
       Perl 5.11.5 is a development release leading up to Perl 5.12.0.	Some
       notable known problems found in 5.11.5 are listed as dependencies of RT
       #69710, the Perl 5 version 12 meta-ticket.

Acknowledgements
       Perl 5.11.5 represents approximately one month of development since
       Perl 5.11.4 and contains 9618 lines of changes across 151 files from 33
       authors and committers:

       var Arnfjoer` Bjarmason, Abigail, brian d foy, Chris Williams, David
       Golden, David Mitchell, Eric Brine, Frank Wiegand, Gisle Aas, H.Merijn
       Brand, Jan Dubois, Jesse Vincent, Jim Cromie, John Peacock, Josh ben
       Jore, Karl Williamson, Marcus Holland-Moritz, Michael G Schwern,
       Nicholas Clark, Offer Kaye, Philippe Bruhat (BooK), Rafael Garcia-
       Suarez, Reini Urban, Ricardo Signes, Robin Barker, Slaven Rezic,
       Steffen Mueller, Steve Hay, Steve Peters, Tim Bunce, Todd Rinaldo, Tony
       Cook and Vincent Pit.

       Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN
       modules included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN
       community for helping Perl to flourish.

Reporting Bugs
       If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles
       recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug
       database at http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ .  There may also be
       information at http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.

       If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug
       program included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a
       tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output
       of "perl -V", will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analyzed by
       the Perl porting team.

       If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
       inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please
       send it to perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed
       subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core
       committers, who be able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out
       a resolution, and help co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate
       or fix the problem across all platforms on which Perl is supported.
       Please only use this address for security issues in the Perl core, not
       for modules independently distributed on CPAN.
