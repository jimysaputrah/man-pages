NAME
       LWP::Protocol - Base class for LWP protocols

SYNOPSIS
	package LWP::Protocol::foo;
	require LWP::Protocol;
	@ISA=qw(LWP::Protocol);

DESCRIPTION
       This class is used a the base class for all protocol implementations
       supported by the LWP library.

       When creating an instance of this class using
       "LWP::Protocol::create($url)", and you get an initialised subclass
       appropriate for that access method. In other words, the
       LWP::Protocol::create() function calls the constructor for one of its
       subclasses.

       All derived LWP::Protocol classes need to override the request() method
       which is used to service a request. The overridden method can make use
       of the collect() function to collect together chunks of data as it is
       received.

       The following methods and functions are provided:

       $prot = LWP::Protocol->new()
	   The LWP::Protocol constructor is inherited by subclasses. As this
	   is a virtual base class this method should not be called directly.

       $prot = LWP::Protocol::create($scheme)
	   Create an object of the class implementing the protocol to handle
	   the given scheme. This is a function, not a method. It is more an
	   object factory than a constructor. This is the function user agents
	   should use to access protocols.

       $class = LWP::Protocol::implementor($scheme, [$class])
	   Get and/or set implementor class for a scheme.  Returns '' if the
	   specified scheme is not supported.

       $prot->request(...)
	    $response = $protocol->request($request, $proxy, undef);
	    $response = $protocol->request($request, $proxy, '/tmp/sss');
	    $response = $protocol->request($request, $proxy, \&callback, 1024);

	   Dispatches a request over the protocol, and returns a response
	   object. This method needs to be overridden in subclasses.  Refer to
	   LWP::UserAgent for description of the arguments.

       $prot->collect($arg, $response, $collector)
	   Called to collect the content of a request, and process it
	   appropriately into a scalar, file, or by calling a callback.  If
	   $arg is undefined, then the content is stored within the $response.
	   If $arg is a simple scalar, then $arg is interpreted as a file name
	   and the content is written to this file.  If $arg is a reference to
	   a routine, then content is passed to this routine.

	   The $collector is a routine that will be called and which is
	   responsible for returning pieces (as ref to scalar) of the content
	   to process.	The $collector signals EOF by returning a reference to
	   an empty sting.

	   The return value from collect() is the $response object reference.

	   Note: We will only use the callback or file argument if
	   $response->is_success().  This avoids sending content data for
	   redirects and authentication responses to the callback which would
	   be confusing.

       $prot->collect_once($arg, $response, $content)
	   Can be called when the whole response content is available as
	   $content.  This will invoke collect() with a collector callback
	   that returns a reference to $content the first time and an empty
	   string the next.
