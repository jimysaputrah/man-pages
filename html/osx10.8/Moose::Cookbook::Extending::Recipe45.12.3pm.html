NAME
       Moose::Cookbook::Extending::Recipe4 - Acting like Moose.pm and
       providing sugar Moose-style

VERSION
       version 2.0205

SYNOPSIS
	 package MyApp::Mooseish;

	 use Moose ();
	 use Moose::Exporter;

	 Moose::Exporter-&gtsetup_import_methods(
	     with_meta =&gt ['has_table'],
	     also      =&gt 'Moose',
	 );

	 sub init_meta {
	     shift;
	     return Moose-&gtinit_meta( @_, metaclass =&gt 'MyApp::Meta::Class' );
	 }

	 sub has_table {
	     my $meta = shift;
	     $meta-&gttable(shift);
	 }

	 package MyApp::Meta::Class;
	 use Moose;

	 extends 'Moose::Meta::Class';

	 has 'table' =&gt ( is =&gt 'rw' );

DESCRIPTION
       This recipe expands on the use of Moose::Exporter we saw in
       Moose::Cookbook::Extending::Recipe1. Instead of providing our own
       object base class, we provide our own metaclass class, and we also
       export a "has_table" sugar function.

       Given the above code, you can now replace all instances of "use Moose"
       with "use MyApp::Mooseish". Similarly, "no Moose" is now replaced with
       "no MyApp::Mooseish".

       The "with_meta" parameter specifies a list of functions that should be
       wrapped before exporting. The wrapper simply ensures that the importing
       package name is the first argument to the function, so we can do
       "my $caller = shift;".

       See the Moose::Exporter docs for more details on its API.

USING MyApp::Mooseish
       The purpose of all this code is to provide a Moose-like interface.
       Here's what it would look like in actual use:

	 package MyApp::User;

	 use MyApp::Mooseish;

	 has_table 'User';

	 has 'username' =&gt ( is =&gt 'ro' );
	 has 'password' =&gt ( is =&gt 'ro' );

	 sub login { ... }

	 no MyApp::Mooseish;

       All of the normal Moose sugar ("has()", "with()", etc) is available
       when you "use MyApp::Mooseish".

CONCLUSION
       Providing sugar functions can make your extension look much more Moose-
       ish. See Fey::ORM for a more extensive example.
