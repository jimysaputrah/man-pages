NAME
       glutCreateSubWindow - creates a subwindow.

SYNTAX
       #include <GLUT/glut.h>

       int glutCreateSubWindow(int win,
	    int x, int y, int width, int height);

ARGUMENTS
       win	 Identifier of the subwindow's parent window.

       x	 Window  X location in pixels relative to parent window's ori-
		 gin.

       y	 Window Y location in pixels relative to parent window's  ori-
		 gin.

       width	 Width in pixels.

       height	 Height in pixels.

DESCRIPTION
       glutCreateSubWindow creates a subwindow of the window identified by win
       of size width and height at location x and y within the current window.
       Implicitly, the current window is set to the newly created subwindow.

       Each  created  window  has  a  unique  associated OpenGL context. State
       changes to a window's associated OpenGL context can be done immediately
       after the window is created.

       The  display state of a window is initially for the window to be shown.
       But the window's display state is not actually acted upon  until  glut-
       MainLoop is entered. This means until glutMainLoop is called, rendering
       to a created window is ineffective. Subwindows can not be iconified.

       Subwindows can be nested arbitrarily deep.

       The value returned is a unique small integer identifier for the window.
       The range of allocated identifiers starts at one.
