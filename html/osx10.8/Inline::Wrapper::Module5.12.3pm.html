NAME
       Inline::Wrapper::Module - Internal object wrapper for individual Inline
       modules.

SYNOPSIS
	use Inline::Wrapper::Module;

DESCRIPTION
       Inline::Wrapper::Module is used internally by Inline::Wrapper, and
       should not be used directly.  It will croak if you attempt to do so.

       It is a descendent class of Inline::Wrapper.

METHODS
   new()
       Takes the same arguments as "new()" in Inline::Wrapper, but also
       requires a module_name and lang_ext argument.

       Don't use this.	It will croak if you try to use it directly.

   initialize()
       Initialize the object instance.

   DESTROY()
       Destructor to clean up the object instance, and wipe the private code
       module namespace created when binding the symbol list.

INHERITANCE
       As Inline::Wrapper::Module is an inherited class from Inline::Wrapper,
       all methods that apply to the base class also apply to objects of this
       class.

       However, note that this has the following effects, due to the semantics
       of the load()/run() steps:

       auto_reload settings vs. when method effects take place:

	auto_reload value:  |  FALSE	      TRUE
	--------------------+------------------------------------------
	set_base_dir()	    |  no effect      after next reload / run()
	set_language()	    |  no effect      after next reload / run()
	add_language()	    |  no effect      after next reload / run()

       Please read through "load()" in Inline::Wrapper and "run()" in
       Inline::Wrapper for insight into why the implementation works like
       this.

AUTHOR
       Please kindly read through this documentation and the examples/
       thoroughly, before emailing me with questions.  Your answer is likely
       in here.

       Also make sure that your issue is actually with the Inline::Wrapper
       modules, and not with Inline itself.
