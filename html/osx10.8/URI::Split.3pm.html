NAME
       URI::Split - Parse and compose URI strings

SYNOPSIS
	use URI::Split qw(uri_split uri_join);
	($scheme, $auth, $path, $query, $frag) = uri_split($uri);
	$uri = uri_join($scheme, $auth, $path, $query, $frag);

DESCRIPTION
       Provides functions to parse and compose URI strings.  The following
       functions are provided:

       ($scheme, $auth, $path, $query, $frag) = uri_split($uri)
	   Breaks up a URI string into its component parts.  An "undef" value
	   is returned for those parts that are not present.  The $path part
	   is always present (but can be the empty string) and is thus never
	   returned as "undef".

	   No sensible value is returned if this function is called in a
	   scalar context.

       $uri = uri_join($scheme, $auth, $path, $query, $frag)
	   Puts together a URI string from its parts.  Missing parts are
	   signaled by passing "undef" for the corresponding argument.

	   Minimal escaping is applied to parts that contain reserved chars
	   that would confuse a parser.  For instance, any occurrence of '?'
	   or '#' in $path is always escaped, as it would otherwise be parsed
	   back as a query or fragment.
