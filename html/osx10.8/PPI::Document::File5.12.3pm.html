NAME
       PPI::Document::File - A Perl Document located in a specific file

DESCRIPTION
       WARNING: This class is experimental, and may change without notice

       PPI::Document::File provides a PPI::Document subclass that represents a
       Perl document stored in a specific named file.

METHODS
   new
	 my $file = PPI::Document::File->new( 'Module.pm' );

       The "new" constructor works the same as for the regular one, except
       that the only params allowed is a file name. You cannot create an
       "anonymous" PPI::Document::File object, not can you create an empty
       one.

       Returns a new PPI::Document::File object, or "undef" on error.

   filename
       The "filename" accessor returns the name of the file in which the
       document is stored.

   save
	 # Save to the file we were loaded from
	 $file->save;

	 # Save a copy to somewhere else
	 $file->save( 'Module2.pm' );

       The "save" method works similarly to the one in the parent
       PPI::Document class, saving a copy of the document to a file.

       The difference with this subclass is that if "save" is not passed any
       filename, it will save it back to the file it was loaded from.

       Note: When saving to a different file, it is considered to be saving a
       copy and so the value returned by the "filename" accessor will stay the
       same, and not change to the new filename.

TO DO
       - May need to overload some methods to forcefully prevent Document
       objects becoming children of another Node.

SUPPORT
       See the support section in the main module.
