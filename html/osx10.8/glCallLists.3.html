NAME
       glCallLists - execute a list of display lists


C SPECIFICATION
       void glCallLists( GLsizei n,
			 GLenum type,
			 const GLvoid *lists )


PARAMETERS
       n      Specifies the number of display lists to be executed.

       type   Specifies  the  type  of	values	in  lists.  Symbolic constants
	      GL_BYTE, GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, GL_SHORT, GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT,  GL_INT,
	      GL_UNSIGNED_INT,	  GL_FLOAT,    GL_2_BYTES,   GL_3_BYTES,   and
	      GL_4_BYTES are accepted.

       lists  Specifies the address of an array of name offsets in the display
	      list.   The  pointer  type  is  void  because the offsets can be
	      bytes, shorts, ints, or floats, depending on the value of  type.

DESCRIPTION
       glCallLists  causes  each  display  list in the list of names passed as
       lists to be executed.  As a result, the commands saved in each  display
       list are executed in order, just as if they were called without using a
       display list.  Names of display lists that have not  been  defined  are
       ignored.

       glCallLists  provides  an  efficient  means for executing more than one
       display list.  type allows  lists  with	various  name  formats	to  be
       accepted.  The formats are as follows:

       GL_BYTE			lists  is treated as an array of signed bytes,
				each in the range -128 through 127.

       GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE 	lists is  treated  as  an  array  of  unsigned
				bytes, each in the range 0 through 255.

       GL_SHORT 		lists  is  treated  as an array of signed two-
				byte  integers,  each  in  the	range	-32768
				through 32767.

       GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT	lists  is treated as an array of unsigned two-
				byte integers, each in	the  range  0  through
				65535.

       GL_INT			lists  is  treated as an array of signed four-
				byte integers.

       GL_UNSIGNED_INT		lists is treated as an array of unsigned four-
				byte integers.

       GL_FLOAT 		lists  is  treated  as	an  array of four-byte
				floating-point values.

       GL_2_BYTES		lists is  treated  as  an  array  of  unsigned
				bytes.	 Each pair of bytes specifies a single
				display-list name.  The value of the  pair  is
				computed  as  256  times the unsigned value of
				the first byte plus the unsigned value of  the
				second byte.

       GL_3_BYTES		lists  is  treated  as	an  array  of unsigned
				bytes.	Each triplet of bytes specifies a sin-
				gle  display-list  name.   The	value  of  the
				triplet  is  computed  as  65536   times   the
				unsigned  value  of  the  first byte, plus 256
				times the unsigned value of the  second  byte,
				plus the unsigned value of the third byte.

       GL_4_BYTES		lists  is  treated  as	an  array  of unsigned
				bytes.	Each quadruplet of bytes  specifies  a
				single	display-list  name.   The value of the
				quadruplet is computed as 16777216  times  the
				unsigned  value  of the first byte, plus 65536
				times the unsigned value of the  second  byte,
				plus 256 times the unsigned value of the third
				byte, plus the unsigned value  of  the	fourth
				byte.

       The list of display-list names is not null-terminated.  Rather, n spec-
       ifies how many names are to be taken from lists.

       An  additional  level  of  indirection  is  made  available  with   the
       glListBase command, which specifies an unsigned offset that is added to
       each display-list name specified in lists before that display  list  is
       executed.

       glCallLists can appear inside a display list.  To avoid the possibility
       of infinite recursion resulting from display lists calling one another,
       a limit is placed on the nesting level of display lists during display-
       list execution.	This limit must be at least 64, and it depends on  the
       implementation.

       GL state is not saved and restored across a call to glCallLists.  Thus,
       changes made to GL state during the  execution  of  the	display  lists
       remain  after  execution  is completed.	Use glPushAttrib, glPopAttrib,
       glPushMatrix, and glPopMatrix to preserve GL state  across  glCallLists
       calls.

NOTES
       Display	lists can be executed between a call to glBegin and the corre-
       sponding call to glEnd, as long as the display list includes only  com-
       mands that are allowed in this interval.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if n is negative.

       GL_INVALID_ENUM	 is   generated   if  type  is	not  one  of  GL_BYTE,
       GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, GL_SHORT, GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT, GL_INT, GL_UNSIGNED_INT,
       GL_FLOAT, GL_2_BYTES, GL_3_BYTES, GL_4_BYTES.

ASSOCIATED GETS
       glGet with argument GL_LIST_BASE
       glGet with argument GL_MAX_LIST_NESTING
       glIsList
