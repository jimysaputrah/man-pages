NAME
       glFlushMappedBufferRange - indicate modifications to a range of a
       mapped buffer

C SPECIFICATION
       GLsync glFlushMappedBufferRange(GLenum target, GLintptr offset,
				       GLsizeiptr length);

PARAMETERS
       target
	   Specifies the target of the flush operation.  target must be
	   GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, GL_COPY_READ_BUFFER, GL_COPY_WRITE_BUFFER,
	   GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, GL_PIXEL_PACK_BUFFER,
	   GL_PIXEL_UNPACK_BUFFER, GL_TEXTURE_BUFFER,
	   GL_TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_BUFFER, or GL_UNIFORM_BUFFER.

       offset
	   Specifies the start of the buffer subrange, in basic machine units.

       length
	   Specifies the length of the buffer subrange, in basic machine
	   units.

DESCRIPTION
       glFlushMappedBufferRange indicates that modifications have been made to
       a range of a mapped buffer. The buffer must previously have been mapped
       with the GL_MAP_FLUSH_EXPLICIT flag.  offset and length indicate the
       modified subrange of the mapping, in basic units. The specified
       subrange to flush is relative to the start of the currently mapped
       range of the buffer.  glFlushMappedBufferRange may be called multiple
       times to indicate distinct subranges of the mapping which require
       flushing.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if offset or length is negative, or if
       offset + length exceeds the size of the mapping.


       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if zero is bound to target.


       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if the buffer bound to target is not
       mapped, or is mapped without the GL_MAP_FLUSH_EXPLICIT flag.
