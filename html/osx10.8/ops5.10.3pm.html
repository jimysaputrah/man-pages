NAME
       ops - Perl pragma to restrict unsafe operations when compiling

SYNOPSIS
	 perl -Mops=:default ...    # only allow reasonably safe operations

	 perl -M-ops=system ...     # disable the 'system' opcode

DESCRIPTION
       Since the "ops" pragma currently has an irreversible global effect, it
       is only of significant practical use with the "-M" option on the
       command line.

       See the Opcode module for information about opcodes, optags, opmasks
       and important information about safety.

SEE ALSO
       Opcode, Safe, perlrun
