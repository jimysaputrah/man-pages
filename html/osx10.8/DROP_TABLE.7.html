NAME
       DROP_TABLE - remove a table

SYNOPSIS
       DROP TABLE [ IF EXISTS ] name [, ...] [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ]

DESCRIPTION
       DROP TABLE removes tables from the database. Only its owner can drop a
       table. To empty a table of rows without destroying the table, use
       DELETE(7) or TRUNCATE(7).


       DROP TABLE always removes any indexes, rules, triggers, and constraints
       that exist for the target table. However, to drop a table that is
       referenced by a view or a foreign-key constraint of another table,
       CASCADE must be specified. (CASCADE will remove a dependent view
       entirely, but in the foreign-key case it will only remove the
       foreign-key constraint, not the other table entirely.)

PARAMETERS
       IF EXISTS
	   Do not throw an error if the table does not exist. A notice is
	   issued in this case.

       name
	   The name (optionally schema-qualified) of the table to drop.

       CASCADE
	   Automatically drop objects that depend on the table (such as
	   views).

       RESTRICT
	   Refuse to drop the table if any objects depend on it. This is the
	   default.

EXAMPLES
       To destroy two tables, films and distributors:

	   DROP TABLE films, distributors;

COMPATIBILITY
       This command conforms to the SQL standard, except that the standard
       only allows one table to be dropped per command, and apart from the IF
       EXISTS option, which is a PostgreSQL extension.

SEE ALSO
       ALTER TABLE (ALTER_TABLE(7)), CREATE TABLE (CREATE_TABLE(7))
