NAME
       DBIx::Class::StartupCheck - Run environment checks on startup

SYNOPSIS
	 use DBIx::Class::StartupCheck;

DESCRIPTION
       This module used to check for, and if necessary issue a warning for, a
       particular bug found on Red Hat and Fedora systems using their system
       perl build. As of September 2008 there are fixed versions of perl for
       all current Red Hat and Fedora distributions, but the old check still
       triggers, incorrectly flagging those versions of perl to be buggy. A
       more comprehensive check has been moved into the test suite in
       "t/99rh_perl_perf_bug.t" and further information about the bug has been
       put in DBIx::Class::Manual::Troubleshooting.

       Other checks may be added from time to time.

       Any checks herein can be disabled by setting an appropriate environment
       variable. If your system suffers from a particular bug, you will get a
       warning message on startup sent to STDERR, explaining what to do about
       it and how to suppress the message. If you don't see any messages, you
       have nothing to worry about.
