NAME
       PPI::Transform - Abstract base class for document transformation
       classes

DESCRIPTION
       "PPI::Transform" provides an API for the creation of classes and
       objects that modify or transform PPI documents.

METHODS
   new
	 my $transform = PPI::Transform->new(
	     param1 => 'value1',
	     param2 => 'value2',
	 );

       The "new" constructor creates a new object for your "PPI::Transform"
       subclass. A default constructor is provided for you which takes no
       params and creates a basic, empty, object.

       If you wish to have your transform constructor take params, these must
       be in the form of a list of key/value pairs.

       Returns a new "PPI::Transform"-compatible object, or returns "undef" on
       error.

   document
       The "document" method should be implemented by each subclass, and takes
       a single argument of a PPI::Document object, modifying it in place as
       appropriate for the particular transform class.

       That's right, this method will not clone and should not clone the
       document object. If you do not want the original to be modified, you
       need to clone it yourself before passing it in.

       Returns the numbers of changes made to the document. If the transform
       is unable to track the quantity (including the situation where it
       cannot tell IF it made a change) it should return 1. Returns zero if no
       changes were made to the document, or "undef" if an error occurs.

       By default this error is likely to only mean that you passed in
       something that wasn't a PPI::Document, but may include additional
       errors depending on the subclass.

   apply
       The "apply" method is used to apply the transform to something. The
       argument must be a PPI::Document, or something which can be turned into
       a one and then be written back to again.

       Currently, this list is limited to a "SCALAR" reference, although a
       handler registration process is available for you to add support for
       additional types of object should you wish (see the source for this
       module).

       Returns true if the transform was applied, false if there is an error
       in the transform process, or may die if there is a critical error in
       the apply handler.

   file
	 # Read from one file and write to another
	 $transform->file( 'Input.pm' => 'Output.pm' );

	 # Change a file in place
	 $transform->file( 'Change.pm' );

       The "file" method modifies a Perl document by filename. If passed a
       single parameter, it modifies the file in-place. If provided a second
       parameter, it will attempt to save the modified file to the alternative
       filename.

       Returns true on success, or "undef" on error.

SUPPORT
       See the support section in the main module.
