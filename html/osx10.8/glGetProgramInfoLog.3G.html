NAME
       glGetProgramInfoLog - Returns the information log for a program object

C SPECIFICATION
       void glGetProgramInfoLog(GLuint program, GLsizei maxLength,
				GLsizei *length, GLchar *infoLog);

PARAMETERS
       program
	   Specifies the program object whose information log is to be
	   queried.

       maxLength
	   Specifies the size of the character buffer for storing the returned
	   information log.

       length
	   Returns the length of the string returned in infoLog (excluding the
	   null terminator).

       infoLog
	   Specifies an array of characters that is used to return the
	   information log.

DESCRIPTION
       glGetProgramInfoLog returns the information log for the specified
       program object. The information log for a program object is modified
       when the program object is linked or validated. The string that is
       returned will be null terminated.

       glGetProgramInfoLog returns in infoLog as much of the information log
       as it can, up to a maximum of maxLength characters. The number of
       characters actually returned, excluding the null termination character,
       is specified by length. If the length of the returned string is not
       required, a value of NULL can be passed in the length argument. The
       size of the buffer required to store the returned information log can
       be obtained by calling glGetProgram() with the value
       GL_INFO_LOG_LENGTH.

       The information log for a program object is either an empty string, or
       a string containing information about the last link operation, or a
       string containing information about the last validation operation. It
       may contain diagnostic messages, warning messages, and other
       information. When a program object is created, its information log will
       be a string of length 0.

NOTES
       The information log for a program object is the OpenGL implementer's
       primary mechanism for conveying information about linking and
       validating. Therefore, the information log can be helpful to
       application developers during the development process, even when these
       operations are successful. Application developers should not expect
       different OpenGL implementations to produce identical information logs.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if program is not a value generated by
       OpenGL.

       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if program is not a program object.

       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if maxLength is less than 0.

ASSOCIATED GETS
       glGetProgram() with argument GL_INFO_LOG_LENGTH

       glIsProgram()
