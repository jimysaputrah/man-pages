DESCRIPTION
       glMaterial assigns  values  to  material  parameters.   There  are  two
       matched	sets  of  material  parameters.  One, the front-facing set, is
       used to shade points, lines, bitmaps, and all polygons (when  two-sided
       lighting  is  disabled),  or just front-facing polygons (when two-sided
       lighting is enabled).  The other set, back-facing,  is  used  to  shade
       back-facing polygons only when two-sided lighting is enabled.  Refer to
       the glLightModel reference page for details concerning  one-  and  two-
       sided lighting calculations.

       glMaterial  takes  three arguments.  The first, face, specifies whether
       the   GL_FRONT	materials,   the   GL_BACK    materials,    or	  both
       GL_FRONT_AND_BACK materials will be modified.  The second, pname, spec-
       ifies which of several parameters in one or both sets will be modified.
       The  third,  params, specifies what value or values will be assigned to
       the specified parameter.

       Material parameters are used in the lighting equation that  is  option-
       ally  applied  to  each	vertex.   The  equation  is  discussed	in the
       glLightModel reference page.  The  parameters  that  can  be  specified
       using  glMaterial,  and their interpretations by the lighting equation,
       are as follows:

       GL_AMBIENT	   params contains four integer or floating-point val-
			   ues	that  specify  the ambient RGBA reflectance of
			   the material.  Integer values are  mapped  linearly
			   such  that  the  most  positive representable value
			   maps to 1.0, and the  most  negative  representable
			   value  maps	to  -1.0.   Floating-point  values are
			   mapped directly.   Neither  integer	nor  floating-
			   point  values  are  clamped.   The  initial ambient
			   reflectance for both front- and back-facing materi-
			   als is (0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 1.0).

       GL_DIFFUSE	   params contains four integer or floating-point val-
			   ues that specify the diffuse  RGBA  reflectance  of
			   the	material.   Integer values are mapped linearly
			   such that the  most	positive  representable  value
			   maps  to  1.0,  and the most negative representable
			   value maps  to  -1.0.   Floating-point  values  are
			   mapped  directly.   Neither	integer  nor floating-
			   point values  are  clamped.	 The  initial  diffuse
			   reflectance for both front- and back-facing materi-
			   als is (0.8, 0.8, 0.8, 1.0).

       GL_SPECULAR	   params contains four integer or floating-point val-
			   ues	that  specify the specular RGBA reflectance of
			   the material.  Integer values are  mapped  linearly
			   such  that  the  most  positive representable value
			   maps to 1.0, and the  most  negative  representable
			   value  maps	to  -1.0.   Floating-point  values are
			   mapped directly.   Neither  integer	nor  floating-
			   point  values  are  clamped.   The initial specular
			   reflectance for both front- and back-facing materi-
			   als is (0, 0, 0, 1).

       GL_EMISSION	   params contains four integer or floating-point val-
			   ues that specify the RGBA emitted  light  intensity
			   of  the  material.	Integer values are mapped lin-
			   early such that  the  most  positive  representable
			   value  maps	to  1.0,  and the most negative repre-
			   sentable value maps to -1.0.  Floating-point values
			   are mapped directly.  Neither integer nor floating-
			   point values are  clamped.	The  initial  emission
			   intensity for both front- and back-facing materials
			   is (0, 0, 0, 1).

       GL_SHININESS	   params is a single integer or floating-point  value
			   that  specifies  the  RGBA specular exponent of the
			   material.  Integer and  floating-point  values  are
			   mapped  directly.  Only values in the range [0,128]
			   are accepted.  The initial  specular  exponent  for
			   both front- and back-facing materials is 0.

       GL_AMBIENT_AND_DIFFUSE
			   Equivalent  to  calling  glMaterial	twice with the
			   same parameter values,  once  with  GL_AMBIENT  and
			   once with GL_DIFFUSE.

       GL_COLOR_INDEXES    params  contains  three  integer  or floating-point
			   values specifying the color	indices  for  ambient,
			   diffuse,  and  specular lighting.  These three val-
			   ues, and GL_SHININESS, are the only material values
			   used  by  the  color  index mode lighting equation.
			   Refer to the glLightModel reference page for a dis-
			   cussion of color index lighting.

NOTES
       The  material  parameters  can  be updated at any time.	In particular,
       glMaterial can be called between a call to glBegin and the  correspond-
       ing  call  to  glEnd.   If  only  a  single material parameter is to be
       changed	per  vertex,  however,	glColorMaterial  is   preferred   over
       glMaterial (see glColorMaterial).

       While  the  ambient, diffuse, specular and emission material parameters
       all have alpha components, only the diffuse alpha component is used  in
       the lighting computation.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if either face or pname is not an accepted
       value.

       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if a specular exponent outside the  range
       [0,128] is specified.
