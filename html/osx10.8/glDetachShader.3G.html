NAME
       glDetachShader - Detaches a shader object from a program object to
       which it is attached

C SPECIFICATION
       void glDetachShader(GLuint program, GLuint shader);

PARAMETERS
       program
	   Specifies the program object from which to detach the shader
	   object.

       shader
	   Specifies the shader object to be detached.

DESCRIPTION
       glDetachShader detaches the shader object specified by shader from the
       program object specified by program. This command can be used to undo
       the effect of the command glAttachShader().

       If shader has already been flagged for deletion by a call to
       glDeleteShader() and it is not attached to any other program object, it
       will be deleted after it has been detached.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if either program or shader is a value
       that was not generated by OpenGL.

       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if program is not a program object.

       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if shader is not a shader object.

       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if shader is not attached to program.

ASSOCIATED GETS
       glGetAttachedShaders() with the handle of a valid program object

       glGetShader() with arguments shader and GL_DELETE_STATUS

       glIsProgram()

       glIsShader()
