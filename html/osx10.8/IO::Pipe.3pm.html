NAME
       IO::Pipe - supply object methods for pipes

SYNOPSIS
	       use IO::Pipe;

	       $pipe = new IO::Pipe;

	       if($pid = fork()) { # Parent
		   $pipe->reader();

		   while(<$pipe>) {
		       ...
		   }

	       }
	       elsif(defined $pid) { # Child
		   $pipe->writer();

		   print $pipe ...
	       }

	       or

	       $pipe = new IO::Pipe;

	       $pipe->reader(qw(ls -l));

	       while(<$pipe>) {
		   ...
	       }

DESCRIPTION
       "IO::Pipe" provides an interface to creating pipes between processes.

CONSTRUCTOR
       new ( [READER, WRITER] )
	   Creates an "IO::Pipe", which is a reference to a newly created
	   symbol (see the "Symbol" package). "IO::Pipe::new" optionally takes
	   two arguments, which should be objects blessed into "IO::Handle",
	   or a subclass thereof. These two objects will be used for the
	   system call to "pipe". If no arguments are given then method
	   "handles" is called on the new "IO::Pipe" object.

	   These two handles are held in the array part of the GLOB until
	   either "reader" or "writer" is called.

METHODS
       reader ([ARGS])
	   The object is re-blessed into a sub-class of "IO::Handle", and
	   becomes a handle at the reading end of the pipe. If "ARGS" are
	   given then "fork" is called and "ARGS" are passed to exec.

       writer ([ARGS])
	   The object is re-blessed into a sub-class of "IO::Handle", and
	   becomes a handle at the writing end of the pipe. If "ARGS" are
	   given then "fork" is called and "ARGS" are passed to exec.

       handles ()
	   This method is called during construction by "IO::Pipe::new" on the
	   newly created "IO::Pipe" object. It returns an array of two objects
	   blessed into "IO::Pipe::End", or a subclass thereof.
