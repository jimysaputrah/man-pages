ALTER OPERATOR(7)	PostgreSQL 9.1.4 Documentation	     ALTER OPERATOR(7)



NAME
       ALTER_OPERATOR - change the definition of an operator

SYNOPSIS
       ALTER OPERATOR name ( { left_type | NONE } , { right_type | NONE } ) OWNER TO new_owner
       ALTER OPERATOR name ( { left_type | NONE } , { right_type | NONE } ) SET SCHEMA new_schema

DESCRIPTION
       ALTER OPERATOR changes the definition of an operator. The only
       currently available functionality is to change the owner of the
       operator.

       You must own the operator to use ALTER OPERATOR. To alter the owner,
       you must also be a direct or indirect member of the new owning role,
       and that role must have CREATE privilege on the operator's schema.
       (These restrictions enforce that altering the owner doesn't do anything
       you couldn't do by dropping and recreating the operator. However, a
       superuser can alter ownership of any operator anyway.)

PARAMETERS
       name
	   The name (optionally schema-qualified) of an existing operator.

       left_type
	   The data type of the operator's left operand; write NONE if the
	   operator has no left operand.

       right_type
	   The data type of the operator's right operand; write NONE if the
	   operator has no right operand.

       new_owner
	   The new owner of the operator.

       new_schema
	   The new schema for the operator.

EXAMPLES
       Change the owner of a custom operator a @@ b for type text:

	   ALTER OPERATOR @@ (text, text) OWNER TO joe;

COMPATIBILITY
       There is no ALTER OPERATOR statement in the SQL standard.

SEE ALSO
       CREATE OPERATOR (CREATE_OPERATOR(7)), DROP OPERATOR (DROP_OPERATOR(7))
