NAME
       lwp-mirror - Simple mirror utility

SYNOPSIS
	lwp-mirror [-v] [-t timeout] <url> <local file>

DESCRIPTION
       This program can be used to mirror a document from a WWW server.  The
       document is only transfered if the remote copy is newer than the local
       copy.  If the local copy is newer nothing happens.

       Use the "-v" option to print the version number of this program.

       The timeout value specified with the "-t" option.  The timeout value is
       the time that the program will wait for response from the remote server
       before it fails.  The default unit for the timeout value is seconds.
       You might append "m" or "h" to the timeout value to make it minutes or
       hours, respectively.

       Because this program is implemented using the LWP library, it only
       supports the protocols that LWP supports.
