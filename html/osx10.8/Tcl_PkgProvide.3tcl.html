Tcl_PkgRequire(3)	    Tcl Library Procedures	     Tcl_PkgRequire(3)



______________________________________________________________________________

NAME
       Tcl_PkgRequire,	Tcl_PkgRequireEx,  Tcl_PkgRequireProc, Tcl_PkgPresent,
       Tcl_PkgPresentEx, Tcl_PkgProvide, Tcl_PkgProvideEx  -  package  version
       control

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lttcl.h&gt

       const char *
       Tcl_PkgRequire(interp, name, version, exact)

       const char *
       Tcl_PkgRequireEx(interp, name, version, exact, clientDataPtr)

       int
       Tcl_PkgRequireProc(interp, name, objc, objv, clientDataPtr)

       const char *
       Tcl_PkgPresent(interp, name, version, exact)

       const char *
       Tcl_PkgPresentEx(interp, name, version, exact, clientDataPtr)

       int
       Tcl_PkgProvide(interp, name, version)

       int
       Tcl_PkgProvideEx(interp, name, version, clientData)

ARGUMENTS
       Tcl_Interp *interp (in)		      Interpreter   where  package  is
					      needed or available.

       const char *name (in)		      Name of package.

       const char *version (in) 	      A version string	consisting  of
					      one or more decimal numbers sep-
					      arated by dots.

       int exact (in)			      Non-zero	means  that  only  the
					      particular  version specified by
					      version  is  acceptable.	  Zero
					      means  that  newer versions than
					      version are also	acceptable  as
					      long as they have the same major
					      version number as version.

       ClientData clientData (in)	      Arbitrary value to be associated
					      with the package.

       ClientData *clientDataPtr (out)	      Pointer  to  place  to store the
					      value associated with the match-
					      ing  package. It is only changed
					      if the pointer is not  NULL  and
					      the  function completed success-
					      fully.

       int objc (in)			      Number of requirements.

       Tcl_Obj* objv[] (in)		      Array of requirements.

DESCRIPTION
       These procedures provide C-level interfaces to Tcl's package  and  ver-
       sion management facilities.

       Tcl_PkgRequire  is equivalent to the package require command, Tcl_PkgP-
       resent is equivalent to the package present command, and Tcl_PkgProvide
       is equivalent to the package provide command.

       See  the  documentation	for the Tcl commands for details on what these
       procedures do.

       If Tcl_PkgPresent or Tcl_PkgRequire complete successfully they return a
       pointer	to  the  version string for the version of the package that is
       provided in the interpreter (which may be different than  version);  if
       an  error  occurs  they	return	NULL and leave an error message in the
       interpreter's result.

       Tcl_PkgProvide returns TCL_OK if it completes successfully; if an error
       occurs  it  returns TCL_ERROR and leaves an error message in the inter-
       preter's result.

       Tcl_PkgProvideEx, Tcl_PkgPresentEx and Tcl_PkgRequireEx allow the  set-
       ting  and retrieving of the client data associated with the package. In
       all other respects they are equivalent to the matching functions.

       Tcl_PkgRequireProc is the form of  package  require  handling  multiple
       requirements.  The  other  forms are present for backward compatibility
       and translate their invocations to this form.
