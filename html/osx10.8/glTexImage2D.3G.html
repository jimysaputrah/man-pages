       data
	   Specifies a pointer to the image data in memory.

DESCRIPTION
       Texturing allows elements of an image array to be read by shaders.

       To define texture images, call glTexImage2D. The arguments describe the
       parameters of the texture image, such as height, width, width of the
       border, level-of-detail number (see glTexParameter()), and number of
       color components provided. The last three arguments describe how the
       image is represented in memory.

       If target is GL_PROXY_TEXTURE_2D, GL_PROXY_TEXTURE_1D_ARRAY,
       GL_PROXY_TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP, or GL_PROXY_TEXTURE_RECTANGLE, no data is
       read from data, but all of the texture image state is recalculated,
       checked for consistency, and checked against the implementation's
       capabilities. If the implementation cannot handle a texture of the
       requested texture size, it sets all of the image state to 0, but does
       not generate an error (see glGetError()). To query for an entire mipmap
       array, use an image array level greater than or equal to 1.

       If target is GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_RECTANGLE or one of the
       GL_TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP targets, data is read from data as a sequence of
       signed or unsigned bytes, shorts, or longs, or single-precision
       floating-point values, depending on type. These values are grouped into
       sets of one, two, three, or four values, depending on format, to form
       elements. Each data byte is treated as eight 1-bit elements, with bit
       ordering determined by GL_UNPACK_LSB_FIRST (see glPixelStore()).

       If target is GL_TEXTURE_1D_ARRAY, data is interpreted as an array of
       one-dimensional images.

       If a non-zero named buffer object is bound to the
       GL_PIXEL_UNPACK_BUFFER target (see glBindBuffer()) while a texture
       image is specified, data is treated as a byte offset into the buffer
       object's data store.

       The first element corresponds to the lower left corner of the texture
       image. Subsequent elements progress left-to-right through the remaining
       texels in the lowest row of the texture image, and then in successively
       higher rows of the texture image. The final element corresponds to the
       upper right corner of the texture image.


       format determines the composition of each element in data. It can
       assume one of these symbolic values:

       GL_RED
	   Each element is a single red component. The GL converts it to
	   floating point and assembles it into an RGBA element by attaching 0
	   for green and blue, and 1 for alpha. Each component is then
	   multiplied by the signed scale factor GL_c_SCALE, added to the
	   signed bias GL_c_BIAS, and clamped to the range [0,1].

       GL_RG
	   Each element is a red/green double. The GL converts it to floating
	   point and assembles it into an RGBA element by attaching 0 for
	   blue, and 1 for alpha. Each component is then multiplied by the
	   signed scale factor GL_c_SCALE, added to the signed bias GL_c_BIAS,
	   and clamped to the range [0,1].

       GL_RGB

       GL_BGR
	   Each element is an RGB triple. The GL converts it to floating point
	   and assembles it into an RGBA element by attaching 1 for alpha.
	   Each component is then multiplied by the signed scale factor
	   GL_c_SCALE, added to the signed bias GL_c_BIAS, and clamped to the
	   range [0,1].

       GL_RGBA

       GL_BGRA
	   Each element contains all four components. Each component is
	   multiplied by the signed scale factor GL_c_SCALE, added to the
	   signed bias GL_c_BIAS, and clamped to the range [0,1].

       GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT
	   Each element is a single depth value. The GL converts it to
	   floating point, multiplies by the signed scale factor
	   GL_DEPTH_SCALE, adds the signed bias GL_DEPTH_BIAS, and clamps to
	   the range [0,1].

       GL_DEPTH_STENCIL
	   Each element is a pair of depth and stencil values. The depth
	   component of the pair is interpreted as in GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT. The
	   stencil component is interpreted based on specified the depth +
	   stencil internal format.

       If an application wants to store the texture at a certain resolution or
       in a certain format, it can request the resolution and format with
       internalFormat. The GL will choose an internal representation that
       closely approximates that requested by internalFormat, but it may not
       match exactly. (The representations specified by GL_RED, GL_RG, GL_RGB,
       and GL_RGBA must match exactly.)

       If the internalFormat parameter is one of the generic compressed
       formats, GL_COMPRESSED_RED, GL_COMPRESSED_RG, GL_COMPRESSED_RGB, or
       GL_COMPRESSED_RGBA, the GL will replace the internal format with the
       symbolic constant for a specific internal format and compress the
       texture before storage. If no corresponding internal format is
       available, or the GL can not compress that image for any reason, the
       internal format is instead replaced with a corresponding base internal
       format.

       If the internalFormat parameter is GL_SRGB, GL_SRGB8, GL_SRGB_ALPHA, or
       GL_SRGB8_ALPHA8, the texture is treated as if the red, green, or blue
       components are encoded in the sRGB color space. Any alpha component is
       left unchanged. The conversion from the sRGB encoded component c s to a
       linear component c l is:


       c l = { c s 12.92 if c s ax 0.04045 ( c s + 0.055 1.055 ) 2.4 if c s >
       0.04045

       Assume c s is the sRGB component in the range [0,1].

       Use the GL_PROXY_TEXTURE_2D, GL_PROXY_TEXTURE_1D_ARRAY,
       GL_PROXY_TEXTURE_RECTANGLE, or GL_PROXY_TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP target to try
       out a resolution and format. The implementation will update and
       recompute its best match for the requested storage resolution and
       format. To then query this state, call glGetTexLevelParameter(). If the
       texture cannot be accommodated, texture state is set to 0.

       A one-component texture image uses only the red component of the RGBA
       color extracted from data. A two-component image uses the R and G
       values. A three-component image uses the R, G, and B values. A
       four-component image uses all of the RGBA components.

       Image-based shadowing can be enabled by comparing texture r coordinates
       to depth texture values to generate a boolean result. See
       glTexParameter() for details on texture comparison.

NOTES
       The glPixelStore() mode affects texture images.


       data may be a null pointer. In this case, texture memory is allocated
       to accommodate a texture of width width and height height. You can then
       download subtextures to initialize this texture memory. The image is
       undefined if the user tries to apply an uninitialized portion of the
       texture image to a primitive.


       glTexImage2D specifies the two-dimensional texture for the current
       texture unit, specified with glActiveTexture().
