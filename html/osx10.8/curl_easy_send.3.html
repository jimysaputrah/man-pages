NAME
       curl_easy_send - sends raw data over an "easy" connection

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curl/easy.h>

       CURLcode  curl_easy_send(  CURL	*curl,	const  void  *buffer,	size_t
       buflen, size_t *n);

DESCRIPTION
       This function sends arbitrary data over the established connection. You
       may  use  it together with curl_easy_recv(3) to implement custom proto-
       cols using libcurl. This functionality can be  particularly  useful  if
       you  use proxies and/or SSL encryption: libcurl will take care of proxy
       negotiation and connection set-up.

       buffer is a pointer to the data of length buflen that  you  want  sent.
       The variable n points to will receive the number of sent bytes.

       To  establish  the  connection,	set CURLOPT_CONNECT_ONLY option before
       calling curl_easy_perform(3). Note that curl_easy_send(3) will not work
       on connections that were created without this option.

       You   must   ensure   that   the  socket  is  writable  before  calling
       curl_easy_send(3), otherwise the call will  return  CURLE_AGAIN	-  the
       socket  is  used  in  non-blocking  mode internally. Use curl_easy_get-
       info(3) with CURLINFO_LASTSOCKET to obtain the socket; use your operat-
       ing  system facilities like select(2) to check if it can be written to.

AVAILABILITY
       Added in 7.18.2.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, returns CURLE_OK and stores the number  of  bytes  actually
       sent  into *n. Note that this may very well be less than the amount you
       wanted to send.

       On failure, returns the appropriate error code.

EXAMPLE
       See sendrecv.c in docs/examples directory for usage example.
