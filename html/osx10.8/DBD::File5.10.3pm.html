NAME
       DBD::File - Base class for writing DBI drivers

SYNOPSIS
	This module is a base class for writing other DBDs.
	It is not intended to function as a DBD itself.
	If you want to access flatfiles, use DBD::AnyData, or DBD::CSV,
	(both of which are subclasses of DBD::File).

DESCRIPTION
       The DBD::File module is not a true DBI driver, but an abstract base
       class for deriving concrete DBI drivers from it. The implication is,
       that these drivers work with plain files, for example CSV files or INI
       files. The module is based on the SQL::Statement module, a simple SQL
       engine.

       See DBI for details on DBI, SQL::Statement for details on
       SQL::Statement and DBD::CSV or DBD::IniFile for example drivers.

   Metadata
       The following attributes are handled by DBI itself and not by
       DBD::File, thus they all work like expected:

	   Active
	   ActiveKids
	   CachedKids
	   CompatMode		  (Not used)
	   InactiveDestroy
	   Kids
	   PrintError
	   RaiseError
	   Warn 		  (Not used)

       The following DBI attributes are handled by DBD::File:

       AutoCommit
	   Always on

       ChopBlanks
	   Works

       NUM_OF_FIELDS
	   Valid after "$sth-"execute&gt

       NUM_OF_PARAMS
	   Valid after "$sth-"prepare&gt

       NAME
	   Valid after "$sth-"execute&gt; undef for Non-Select statements.

       NULLABLE
	   Not really working, always returns an array ref of one's, as
	   DBD::CSV doesn't verify input data. Valid after "$sth-"execute&gt;
	   undef for Non-Select statements.

       These attributes and methods are not supported:

	   bind_param_inout
	   CursorName
	   LongReadLen
	   LongTruncOk

       Additional to the DBI attributes, you can use the following dbh
       attribute:

       f_dir
	   This attribute is used for setting the directory where CSV files
	   are opened. Usually you set it in the dbh, it defaults to the
	   current directory ("."). However, it is overwritable in the
	   statement handles.

       f_ext
	   This attribute is used for setting the file extension where (CSV)
	   files are opened. There are several possibilities.

	       DBI:CSV:f_dir=data;f_ext=.csv

	   In this case, DBD::File will open only "table.csv" if both
	   "table.csv" and "table" exist in the datadir. The table will still
	   be named "table". If your datadir has files with extensions, and
	   you do not pass this attribute, your table is named "table.csv",
	   which is probably not what you wanted. The extension is always
	   case-insensitive. The table names are not.

	       DBI:CSV:f_dir=data;f_ext=.csv/r

	   In this case the extension is required, and all filenames that do
	   not match are ignored.

       f_schema
	   This will set the schema name. Default is the owner of the folder
	   in which the table file resides.  "undef" is allowed.

	       my $dbh = DBI-&gtconnect ("dbi:CSV:", "", "", {
		   f_schema =&gt undef,
		   f_dir    =&gt "data",
		   f_ext    =&gt ".csv/r",
		   }) or die $DBI::errstr;

	   The effect is that when you get table names from DBI, you can force
	   all tables into the same (or no) schema:

	       my @tables $dbh-&gttables ();

	       # no f_schema
	       "merijn".foo
	       "merijn".bar

	       # f_schema =&gt "dbi"
	       "dbi".foo
	       "dbi".bar

	       # f_schema =&gt undef
	       foo
	       bar

   Driver private methods
       data_sources
	   The "data_sources" method returns a list of subdirectories of the
	   current directory in the form "DBI:CSV:f_dir=$dirname".

	   If you want to read the subdirectories of another directory, use

	       my ($drh) = DBI-&gtinstall_driver ("CSV");
	       my (@list) = $drh-&gtdata_sources (f_dir =&gt "/usr/local/csv_data" );

       list_tables
	   This method returns a list of file names inside $dbh-&gt{f_dir}.
	   Example:

	       my ($dbh) = DBI-&gtconnect ("DBI:CSV:f_dir=/usr/local/csv_data");
	       my (@list) = $dbh-&gtfunc ("list_tables");

	   Note that the list includes all files contained in the directory,
	   even those that have non-valid table names, from the view of SQL.

KNOWN BUGS
       o       The module is using flock () internally. However, this function
	       is not available on all platforms. Using flock () is disabled
	       on MacOS and Windows 95: There's no locking at all (perhaps not
	       so important on MacOS and Windows 95, as there's a single user
	       anyways).
