NAME
       Test::Builder - Backend for building test libraries

SYNOPSIS
	 package My::Test::Module;
	 use base 'Test::Builder::Module';

	 my $CLASS = __PACKAGE__;

	 sub ok {
	     my($test, $name) = @_;
	     my $tb = $CLASS-&gtbuilder;

	     $tb-&gtok($test, $name);
	 }

DESCRIPTION
       Test::Simple and Test::More have proven to be popular testing modules,
       but they're not always flexible enough.	Test::Builder provides the a
       building block upon which to write your own test libraries which can
       work together.

   Construction
       new
	     my $Test = Test::Builder-&gtnew;

	   Returns a Test::Builder object representing the current state of
	   the test.

	   Since you only run one test per program "new" always returns the
	   same Test::Builder object.  No matter how many times you call
	   "new()", you're getting the same object.  This is called a
	   singleton.  This is done so that multiple modules share such global
	   information as the test counter and where test output is going.

	   If you want a completely new Test::Builder object different from
	   the singleton, use "create".

       create
	     my $Test = Test::Builder-&gtcreate;

	   Ok, so there can be more than one Test::Builder object and this is
	   how you get it.  You might use this instead of "new()" if you're
	   testing a Test::Builder based module, but otherwise you probably
	   want "new".

	   NOTE: the implementation is not complete.  "level", for example, is
	   still shared amongst all Test::Builder objects, even ones created
	   using this method.  Also, the method name may change in the future.

       child
	     my $child = $builder-&gtchild($name_of_child);
	     $child-&gtplan( tests =&gt 4 );
	     $child-&gtok(some_code());
	     ...
	     $child-&gtfinalize;

	   Returns a new instance of "Test::Builder".  Any output from this
	   child will indented four spaces more than the parent's indentation.
	   When done, the "finalize" method must be called explicitly.

	   Trying to create a new child with a previous child still active
	   (i.e., "finalize" not called) will "croak".

	   Trying to run a test when you have an open child will also "croak"
	   and cause the test suite to fail.

       subtest
	       $builder-&gtsubtest($name, \&subtests);

	   See documentation of "subtest" in Test::More.

       finalize
	     my $ok = $child-&gtfinalize;

	   When your child is done running tests, you must call "finalize" to
	   clean up and tell the parent your pass/fail status.

	   Calling finalize on a child with open children will "croak".

	   If the child falls out of scope before "finalize" is called, a
	   failure diagnostic will be issued and the child is considered to
	   have failed.

	   No attempt to call methods on a child after "finalize" is called is
	   guaranteed to succeed.

	   Calling this on the root builder is a no-op.

       parent
	    if ( my $parent = $builder-&gtparent ) {
		...
	    }

	   Returns the parent "Test::Builder" instance, if any.  Only used
	   with child builders for nested TAP.

       name
	    diag $builder-&gtname;

	   Returns the name of the current builder.  Top level builders
	   default to $0 (the name of the executable).	Child builders are
	   named via the "child" method.  If no name is supplied, will be
	   named "Child of $parent-&gtname".

       reset
	     $Test-&gtreset;

	   Reinitializes the Test::Builder singleton to its original state.
	   Mostly useful for tests run in persistent environments where the
	   same test might be run multiple times in the same process.

   Setting up tests
       These methods are for setting up tests and declaring how many there
       are.  You usually only want to call one of these methods.

       plan
	     $Test-&gtplan('no_plan');
	     $Test-&gtplan( skip_all =&gt $reason );
	     $Test-&gtplan( tests =&gt $num_tests );

	   A convenient way to set up your tests.  Call this and Test::Builder
	   will print the appropriate headers and take the appropriate
	   actions.

	   If you call "plan()", don't call any of the other methods below.

	   If a child calls "skip_all" in the plan, a
	   "Test::Builder::Exception" is thrown.  Trap this error, call
	   "finalize()" and don't run any more tests on the child.

	    my $child = $Test-&gtchild('some child');
	    eval { $child-&gtplan( $condition ? ( skip_all =&gt $reason ) : ( tests =&gt 3 )	) };
	    if ( eval { $@-&gtisa('Test::Builder::Exception') } ) {
	       $child-&gtfinalize;
	       return;
	    }
	    # run your tests

       expected_tests
	       my $max = $Test-&gtexpected_tests;
	       $Test-&gtexpected_tests($max);

	   Gets/sets the number of tests we expect this test to run and prints
	   out the appropriate headers.

       no_plan
	     $Test-&gtno_plan;

	   Declares that this test will run an indeterminate number of tests.

       done_testing
	     $Test-&gtdone_testing();
	     $Test-&gtdone_testing($num_tests);

	   Declares that you are done testing, no more tests will be run after
	   this point.

	   If a plan has not yet been output, it will do so.

	   $num_tests is the number of tests you planned to run.  If a
	   numbered plan was already declared, and if this contradicts, a
	   failing test will be run to reflect the planning mistake.  If
	   "no_plan" was declared, this will override.

	   If "done_testing()" is called twice, the second call will issue a
	   failing test.

	   If $num_tests is omitted, the number of tests run will be used,
	   like no_plan.

	   "done_testing()" is, in effect, used when you'd want to use
	   "no_plan", but safer. You'd use it like so:

	       $Test-&gtok($a == $b);
	       $Test-&gtdone_testing();

	   Or to plan a variable number of tests:

	       for my $test (@tests) {
		   $Test-&gtok($test);
	       }
	       $Test-&gtdone_testing(@tests);

       has_plan
	     $plan = $Test-&gthas_plan

	   Find out whether a plan has been defined. $plan is either "undef"
	   (no plan has been set), "no_plan" (indeterminate # of tests) or an
	   integer (the number of expected tests).

       skip_all
	     $Test-&gtskip_all;
	     $Test-&gtskip_all($reason);

	   Skips all the tests, using the given $reason.  Exits immediately
	   with 0.

       exported_to
	     my $pack = $Test-&gtexported_to;
	     $Test-&gtexported_to($pack);

	   Tells Test::Builder what package you exported your functions to.

	   This method isn't terribly useful since modules which share the
	   same Test::Builder object might get exported to different packages
	   and only the last one will be honored.

   Running tests
       These actually run the tests, analogous to the functions in Test::More.

       They all return true if the test passed, false if the test failed.

       $name is always optional.

       ok
	     $Test-&gtok($test, $name);

	   Your basic test.  Pass if $test is true, fail if $test is false.
	   Just like Test::Simple's "ok()".

       is_eq
	     $Test-&gtis_eq($got, $expected, $name);

	   Like Test::More's "is()".  Checks if "$got eq $expected".  This is
	   the string version.

       is_num
	     $Test-&gtis_num($got, $expected, $name);

	   Like Test::More's "is()".  Checks if "$got == $expected".  This is
	   the numeric version.

       isnt_eq
	     $Test-&gtisnt_eq($got, $dont_expect, $name);

	   Like Test::More's "isnt()".	Checks if "$got ne $dont_expect".
	   This is the string version.

       isnt_num
	     $Test-&gtisnt_num($got, $dont_expect, $name);

	   Like Test::More's "isnt()".	Checks if "$got ne $dont_expect".
	   This is the numeric version.

       like
	     $Test-&gtlike($this, qr/$regex/, $name);
	     $Test-&gtlike($this, '/$regex/', $name);

	   Like Test::More's "like()".	Checks if $this matches the given
	   $regex.

       unlike
	     $Test-&gtunlike($this, qr/$regex/, $name);
	     $Test-&gtunlike($this, '/$regex/', $name);

	   Like Test::More's "unlike()".  Checks if $this does not match the
	   given $regex.

       cmp_ok
	     $Test-&gtcmp_ok($this, $type, $that, $name);

	   Works just like Test::More's "cmp_ok()".

	       $Test-&gtcmp_ok($big_num, '!=', $other_big_num);

   Other Testing Methods
       These are methods which are used in the course of writing a test but
       are not themselves tests.

       BAIL_OUT
	       $Test-&gtBAIL_OUT($reason);

	   Indicates to the Test::Harness that things are going so badly all
	   testing should terminate.  This includes running any additional
	   test scripts.

	   It will exit with 255.

       skip
	       $Test-&gtskip;
	       $Test-&gtskip($why);

	   Skips the current test, reporting $why.

       todo_skip
	     $Test-&gttodo_skip;
	     $Test-&gttodo_skip($why);

	   Like "skip()", only it will declare the test as failing and TODO.
	   Similar to

	       print "not ok $tnum # TODO $why\n";

   Test building utility methods
       These methods are useful when writing your own test methods.

       maybe_regex
	     $Test-&gtmaybe_regex(qr/$regex/);
	     $Test-&gtmaybe_regex('/$regex/');

	   This method used to be useful back when Test::Builder worked on
	   Perls before 5.6 which didn't have qr//.  Now its pretty useless.

	   Convenience method for building testing functions that take regular
	   expressions as arguments.

	   Takes a quoted regular expression produced by "qr//", or a string
	   representing a regular expression.

	   Returns a Perl value which may be used instead of the corresponding
	   regular expression, or "undef" if its argument is not recognised.

	   For example, a version of "like()", sans the useful diagnostic
	   messages, could be written as:

	     sub laconic_like {
		 my ($self, $this, $regex, $name) = @_;
		 my $usable_regex = $self-&gtmaybe_regex($regex);
		 die "expecting regex, found '$regex'\n"
		     unless $usable_regex;
		 $self-&gtok($this =~ m/$usable_regex/, $name);
	     }

       is_fh
	       my $is_fh = $Test-&gtis_fh($thing);

	   Determines if the given $thing can be used as a filehandle.

   Test style
       level
	       $Test-&gtlevel($how_high);

	   How far up the call stack should $Test look when reporting where
	   the test failed.

	   Defaults to 1.

	   Setting $Test::Builder::Level overrides.  This is typically useful
	   localized:

	       sub my_ok {
		   my $test = shift;

		   local $Test::Builder::Level = $Test::Builder::Level + 1;
		   $TB-&gtok($test);
	       }

	   To be polite to other functions wrapping your own you usually want
	   to increment $Level rather than set it to a constant.

       use_numbers
	       $Test-&gtuse_numbers($on_or_off);

	   Whether or not the test should output numbers.  That is, this if
	   true:

	     ok 1
	     ok 2
	     ok 3

	   or this if false

	     ok
	     ok
	     ok

	   Most useful when you can't depend on the test output order, such as
	   when threads or forking is involved.

	   Defaults to on.

       no_diag
	       $Test-&gtno_diag($no_diag);

	   If set true no diagnostics will be printed.	This includes calls to
	   "diag()".

       no_ending
	       $Test-&gtno_ending($no_ending);

	   Normally, Test::Builder does some extra diagnostics when the test
	   ends.  It also changes the exit code as described below.

	   If this is true, none of that will be done.

       no_header
	       $Test-&gtno_header($no_header);

	   If set to true, no "1..N" header will be printed.

   Output
       Controlling where the test output goes.

       It's ok for your test to change where STDOUT and STDERR point to,
       Test::Builder's default output settings will not be affected.

       diag
	       $Test-&gtdiag(@msgs);

	   Prints out the given @msgs.	Like "print", arguments are simply
	   appended together.

	   Normally, it uses the "failure_output()" handle, but if this is for
	   a TODO test, the "todo_output()" handle is used.

	   Output will be indented and marked with a # so as not to interfere
	   with test output.  A newline will be put on the end if there isn't
	   one already.

	   We encourage using this rather than calling print directly.

	   Returns false.  Why?  Because "diag()" is often used in conjunction
	   with a failing test ("ok() || diag()") it "passes through" the
	   failure.

	       return ok(...) || diag(...);

       note
	       $Test-&gtnote(@msgs);

	   Like "diag()", but it prints to the "output()" handle so it will
	   not normally be seen by the user except in verbose mode.

       explain
	       my @dump = $Test-&gtexplain(@msgs);

	   Will dump the contents of any references in a human readable
	   format.  Handy for things like...

	       is_deeply($have, $want) || diag explain $have;

	   or

	       is_deeply($have, $want) || note explain $have;

       output
       failure_output
       todo_output
	       my $filehandle = $Test-&gtoutput;
	       $Test-&gtoutput($filehandle);
	       $Test-&gtoutput($filename);
	       $Test-&gtoutput(\$scalar);

	   These methods control where Test::Builder will print its output.
	   They take either an open $filehandle, a $filename to open and write
	   to or a $scalar reference to append to.  It will always return a
	   $filehandle.

	   output is where normal "ok/not ok" test output goes.

	   Defaults to STDOUT.

	   failure_output is where diagnostic output on test failures and
	   "diag()" goes.  It is normally not read by Test::Harness and
	   instead is displayed to the user.

	   Defaults to STDERR.

	   "todo_output" is used instead of "failure_output()" for the
	   diagnostics of a failing TODO test.	These will not be seen by the
	   user.

	   Defaults to STDOUT.

       reset_outputs
	     $tb-&gtreset_outputs;

	   Resets all the output filehandles back to their defaults.

       carp
	     $tb-&gtcarp(@message);

	   Warns with @message but the message will appear to come from the
	   point where the original test function was called ("$tb-&gtcaller").

       croak
	     $tb-&gtcroak(@message);

	   Dies with @message but the message will appear to come from the
	   point where the original test function was called ("$tb-&gtcaller").

   Test Status and Info
       current_test
	       my $curr_test = $Test-&gtcurrent_test;
	       $Test-&gtcurrent_test($num);

	   Gets/sets the current test number we're on.	You usually shouldn't
	   have to set this.

	   If set forward, the details of the missing tests are filled in as
	   'unknown'.  if set backward, the details of the intervening tests
	   are deleted.  You can erase history if you really want to.

       is_passing
	      my $ok = $builder-&gtis_passing;

	   Indicates if the test suite is currently passing.

	   More formally, it will be false if anything has happened which
	   makes it impossible for the test suite to pass.  True otherwise.

	   For example, if no tests have run "is_passing()" will be true
	   because even though a suite with no tests is a failure you can add
	   a passing test to it and start passing.

	   Don't think about it too much.

       summary
	       my @tests = $Test-&gtsummary;

	   A simple summary of the tests so far.  True for pass, false for
	   fail.  This is a logical pass/fail, so todos are passes.

	   Of course, test #1 is $tests[0], etc...

       details
	       my @tests = $Test-&gtdetails;

	   Like "summary()", but with a lot more detail.

	       $tests[$test_num - 1] =
		       { 'ok'	    =&gt is the test considered a pass?
			 actual_ok  =&gt did it literally say 'ok'?
			 name	    =&gt name of the test (if any)
			 type	    =&gt type of test (if any, see below).
			 reason     =&gt reason for the above (if any)
		       };

	   'ok' is true if Test::Harness will consider the test to be a pass.

	   'actual_ok' is a reflection of whether or not the test literally
	   printed 'ok' or 'not ok'.  This is for examining the result of
	   'todo' tests.

	   'name' is the name of the test.

	   'type' indicates if it was a special test.  Normal tests have a
	   type of ''.	Type can be one of the following:

	       skip	   see skip()
	       todo	   see todo()
	       todo_skip   see todo_skip()
	       unknown	   see below

	   Sometimes the Test::Builder test counter is incremented without it
	   printing any test output, for example, when "current_test()" is
	   changed.  In these cases, Test::Builder doesn't know the result of
	   the test, so its type is 'unknown'.	These details for these tests
	   are filled in.  They are considered ok, but the name and actual_ok
	   is left "undef".

	   For example "not ok 23 - hole count # TODO insufficient donuts"
	   would result in this structure:

	       $tests[22] =    # 23 - 1, since arrays start from 0.
		 { ok	     =&gt 1,   # logically, the test passed since its todo
		   actual_ok =&gt 0,   # in absolute terms, it failed
		   name      =&gt 'hole count',
		   type      =&gt 'todo',
		   reason    =&gt 'insufficient donuts'
		 };

       todo
	       my $todo_reason = $Test-&gttodo;
	       my $todo_reason = $Test-&gttodo($pack);

	   If the current tests are considered "TODO" it will return the
	   reason, if any.  This reason can come from a $TODO variable or the
	   last call to "todo_start()".

	   Since a TODO test does not need a reason, this function can return
	   an empty string even when inside a TODO block.  Use
	   "$Test-&gtin_todo" to determine if you are currently inside a TODO
	   block.

	   "todo()" is about finding the right package to look for $TODO in.
	   It's pretty good at guessing the right package to look at.  It
	   first looks for the caller based on "$Level + 1", since "todo()" is
	   usually called inside a test function.  As a last resort it will
	   use "exported_to()".

	   Sometimes there is some confusion about where todo() should be
	   looking for the $TODO variable.  If you want to be sure, tell it
	   explicitly what $pack to use.

       find_TODO
	       my $todo_reason = $Test-&gtfind_TODO();
	       my $todo_reason = $Test-&gtfind_TODO($pack):

	   Like "todo()" but only returns the value of $TODO ignoring
	   "todo_start()".

       in_todo
	       my $in_todo = $Test-&gtin_todo;

	   Returns true if the test is currently inside a TODO block.

       todo_start
	       $Test-&gttodo_start();
	       $Test-&gttodo_start($message);

	   This method allows you declare all subsequent tests as TODO tests,
	   up until the "todo_end" method has been called.

	   The "TODO:" and $TODO syntax is generally pretty good about
	   figuring out whether or not we're in a TODO test.  However, often
	   we find that this is not possible to determine (such as when we
	   want to use $TODO but the tests are being executed in other
	   packages which can't be inferred beforehand).

	   Note that you can use this to nest "todo" tests

	    $Test-&gttodo_start('working on this');
	    # lots of code
	    $Test-&gttodo_start('working on that');
	    # more code
	    $Test-&gttodo_end;
	    $Test-&gttodo_end;

	   This is generally not recommended, but large testing systems often
	   have weird internal needs.

	   We've tried to make this also work with the TODO: syntax, but it's
	   not guaranteed and its use is also discouraged:

	    TODO: {
		local $TODO = 'We have work to do!';
		$Test-&gttodo_start('working on this');
		# lots of code
		$Test-&gttodo_start('working on that');
		# more code
		$Test-&gttodo_end;
		$Test-&gttodo_end;
	    }

	   Pick one style or another of "TODO" to be on the safe side.

       "todo_end"
	    $Test-&gttodo_end;

	   Stops running tests as "TODO" tests.  This method is fatal if
	   called without a preceding "todo_start" method call.

       caller
	       my $package = $Test-&gtcaller;
	       my($pack, $file, $line) = $Test-&gtcaller;
	       my($pack, $file, $line) = $Test-&gtcaller($height);

	   Like the normal "caller()", except it reports according to your
	   "level()".

	   $height will be added to the "level()".

	   If "caller()" winds up off the top of the stack it report the
	   highest context.

EXIT CODES
       If all your tests passed, Test::Builder will exit with zero (which is
       normal).  If anything failed it will exit with how many failed.	If you
       run less (or more) tests than you planned, the missing (or extras) will
       be considered failures.	If no tests were ever run Test::Builder will
       throw a warning and exit with 255.  If the test died, even after having
       successfully completed all its tests, it will still be considered a
       failure and will exit with 255.

       So the exit codes are...

	   0		       all tests successful
	   255		       test died or all passed but wrong # of tests run
	   any other number    how many failed (including missing or extras)

       If you fail more than 254 tests, it will be reported as 254.

THREADS
       In perl 5.8.1 and later, Test::Builder is thread-safe.  The test number
       is shared amongst all threads.  This means if one thread sets the test
       number using "current_test()" they will all be effected.

       While versions earlier than 5.8.1 had threads they contain too many
       bugs to support.

       Test::Builder is only thread-aware if threads.pm is loaded before
       Test::Builder.

MEMORY
       An informative hash, accessable via "&ltdetails()"&gt, is stored for each
       test you perform.  So memory usage will scale linearly with each test
       run. Although this is not a problem for most test suites, it can become
       an issue if you do large (hundred thousands to million) combinatorics
       tests in the same run.

       In such cases, you are advised to either split the test file into
       smaller ones, or use a reverse approach, doing "normal" (code) compares
       and triggering fail() should anything go unexpected.

       Future versions of Test::Builder will have a way to turn history off.

EXAMPLES
       CPAN can provide the best examples.  Test::Simple, Test::More,
       Test::Exception and Test::Differences all use Test::Builder.
