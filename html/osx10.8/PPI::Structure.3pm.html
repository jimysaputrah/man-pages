NAME
       PPI::Structure - The base class for Perl braced structures

INHERITANCE
	 PPI::Structure
	 isa PPI::Node
	     isa PPI::Element

DESCRIPTION
       PPI::Structure is the root class for all Perl bracing structures. This
       covers all forms of " [ ... ] ", " { ... } ", and " ( ... ) " brace
       types, and includes cases where only one half of the pair exist.

       The class PPI::Structure itself is full abstract and no objects of that
       type should actually exist in the tree.

   Elements vs Children
       A PPI::Structure has an unusual existance. Unlike a PPI::Document or
       PPI::Statement, which both simply contain other elements, a structure
       both contains and consists of content.

       That is, the brace tokens are not considered to be "children" of the
       structure, but are part of it.

       In practice, this will mean that while the ->elements and ->tokens
       methods (and related) will return a list with the brace tokens at
       either end, the ->children method explicitly will not return the brace.

STRUCTURE CLASSES
       Excluding the transient PPI::Structure::Unknown that exists briefly
       inside the parser, there are eight types of structure.

   PPI::Structure::List
       This covers all round braces used for function arguments, in "foreach"
       loops, literal lists, and braces used for precedence-ordering purposes.

   PPI::Structure::For
       Although not used for the "foreach" loop list, this is used for the
       special case of the round-brace three-part semicolon-seperated "for"
       loop expression (the traditional C style for loop).

   PPI::Structure::Given
       This is for the expression being matched in switch statements.

   PPI::Structure::When
       This is for the matching expression in "when" statements.

   PPI::Structure::Condition
       This round-brace structure covers boolean conditional braces, such as
       for "if" and "while" blocks.

   PPI::Structure::Block
       This curly-brace and common structure is used for all form of code
       blocks. This includes those for "if", "do" and similar, as well as
       "grep", "map", "sort", "sub" and (labelled or anonymous) scoping
       blocks.

   PPI::Structure::Constructor
       This class covers brace structures used for the construction of
       anonymous "ARRAY" and "HASH" references.

   PPI::Structure::Subscript
       This class covers square-braces and curly-braces used after a ->
       pointer to access the subscript of an "ARRAY" or "HASH".

METHODS
       "PPI::Structure" itself has very few methods. Most of the time, you
       will be working with the more generic PPI::Element or PPI::Node
       methods, or one of the methods that are subclass-specific.

   start
       For lack of better terminology (like "open" and "close") that has not
       already in use for some other more important purpose, the two
       individual braces for the structure are known within PPI as the "start"
       and "finish" braces (at least for method purposes).

       The "start" method returns the start brace for the structure (i.e. the
       opening brace).

       Returns the brace as a PPI::Token::Structure or "undef" if the
       structure does not have a starting brace.

       Under normal parsing circumstances this should never occur, but may
       happen due to manipulation of the PDOM tree.

   finish
       The "finish" method returns the finish brace for the structure (i.e.
       the closing brace).

       Returns the brace as a PPI::Token::Structure or "undef" if the
       structure does not have a finishing brace. This can be quite common if
       the document is not complete (for example, from an editor where the
       user may be halfway through typeing a subroutine).

   braces
       The "braces" method is a utility method which returns the brace type,
       regardless of whether has both braces defined, or just the starting
       brace, or just the ending brace.

       Returns on of the three strings '[]', '{}', or '()', or "undef" on
       error (primarily not having a start brace, as mentioned above).

complete
       The "complete" method is a convenience method that returns true if the
       both braces are defined for the structure, or false if only one brace
       is defined.

       Unlike the top level "complete" method which checks for completeness in
       depth, the structure complete method ONLY confirms completeness for the
       braces, and does not recurse downwards.
