NAME
       File::Spec::Cygwin - methods for Cygwin file specs

SYNOPSIS
	require File::Spec::Cygwin; # Done internally by File::Spec if needed

DESCRIPTION
       See File::Spec and File::Spec::Unix.  This package overrides the
       implementation of these methods, not the semantics.

       This module is still in beta.  Cygwin-knowledgeable folks are invited
       to offer patches and suggestions.

       canonpath
	   Any "\" (backslashes) are converted to "/" (forward slashes), and
	   then File::Spec::Unix canonpath() is called on the result.

       file_name_is_absolute
	   True is returned if the file name begins with "drive_letter:", and
	   if not, File::Spec::Unix file_name_is_absolute() is called.

       tmpdir (override)
	   Returns a string representation of the first existing directory
	   from the following list:

	       $ENV{TMPDIR}
	       /tmp
	       $ENV{'TMP'}
	       $ENV{'TEMP'}
	       C:/temp

	   Since Perl 5.8.0, if running under taint mode, and if the
	   environment variables are tainted, they are not used.

       case_tolerant
	   Override Unix. Cygwin case-tolerance depends on managed mount
	   settings and as with MsWin32 on GetVolumeInformation() $ouFsFlags
	   == FS_CASE_SENSITIVE, indicating the case significance when
	   comparing file specifications.  Default: 1
