NAME
       form_driver - command-processing loop of the form system

SYNOPSIS
       #include &ltform.h&gt
       int form_driver(FORM *form, int c);

DESCRIPTION
       Once a form has been posted (displayed), you should funnel input events
       to it through form_driver.  This routine has three major input cases:

       -  The input is a form navigation request.   Navigation	request  codes
	  are  constants defined in &ltform.h&gt, which are distinct from the key-
	  and character codes returned by wgetch.

       -  The input is a printable  character.	 Printable  characters	(which
	  must	be  positive, less than 256) are checked according to the pro-
	  gram's locale settings.

       -  The input is the KEY_MOUSE special  key  associated  with  an  mouse
	  event.

       The form driver requests are as follows:

       REQ_VALIDATION
	    Validate field.

       REQ_NEXT_CHOICE
	    Display next field choice.

       REQ_PREV_CHOICE
	    Display previous field choice.

       If  the	second argument is a printable character, the driver places it
       in the current position in the current field.  If  it  is  one  of  the
       forms requests listed above, that request is executed.

   MOUSE HANDLING
       If  the	second	argument  is the KEY_MOUSE special key, the associated
       mouse event is translated into one of the above	pre-defined  requests.
       Currently  only clicks in the user window (e.g. inside the form display
       area or the decoration window) are handled.

       If you click above the display region of the form:

	      a REQ_PREV_FIELD is generated for a single click,

	      a REQ_PREV_PAGE is generated for a double-click and

	      a REQ_FIRST_FIELD is generated for a triple-click.

       If you click below the display region of the form:

	      a REQ_NEXT_FIELD is generated for a single click,

	      a REQ_NEXT_PAGE is generated for a double-click and

	      a REQ_LAST_FIELD is generated for a triple-click.

       If you click at an field inside the display area of the form:

	      -  the form cursor is positioned to that field.

	      -  If you double-click a field, the form cursor is positioned to
		 that  field  and  E_UNKNOWN_COMMAND is returned.  This return
		 value makes sense, because a double click usually means  that
		 an  field-specific  action should be returned.  It is exactly
		 the purpose of this return value to signal that  an  applica-
		 tion specific command should be executed.

	      -  If a translation into a request was done, form_driver returns
		 the result of this request.

       If you clicked outside the user window or the mouse event could not  be
       translated into a form request an E_REQUEST_DENIED is returned.

   APPLICATION-DEFINED COMMANDS
       If  the	second argument is neither printable nor one of the above pre-
       defined form requests, the driver assumes it is an application-specific
       command	and  returns  E_UNKNOWN_COMMAND.  Application-defined commands
       should be defined relative to MAX_COMMAND, the maximum value  of  these
       pre-defined requests.

RETURN VALUE
       form_driver returns one of the following error codes:

       E_OK The routine succeeded.

       E_BAD_ARGUMENT
	    Routine detected an incorrect or out-of-range argument.

       E_BAD_STATE
	    Routine was called from an initialization or termination function.

       E_NOT_POSTED
	    The form has not been posted.

       E_INVALID_FIELD
	    Contents of field is invalid.

       E_REQUEST_DENIED
	    The form driver could not process the request.

       E_SYSTEM_ERROR
	    System error occurred (see errno).

       E_UNKNOWN_COMMAND
	    The form driver code saw an unknown request code.

NOTES
       The header  file  &ltform.h&gt  automatically  includes  the  header  files
       &ltcurses.h&gt.

PORTABILITY
       These  routines emulate the System V forms library.  They were not sup-
       ported on Version 7 or BSD versions.
