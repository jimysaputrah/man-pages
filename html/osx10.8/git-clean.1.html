NAME
       git-clean - Remove untracked files from the working tree

SYNOPSIS
       git clean [-d] [-f] [-n] [-q] [-e &ltpattern&gt] [-x | -X] [--] &ltpath&gt...


DESCRIPTION
       Cleans the working tree by recursively removing files that are not
       under version control, starting from the current directory.

       Normally, only files unknown to git are removed, but if the -x option
       is specified, ignored files are also removed. This can, for example, be
       useful to remove all build products.

       If any optional &ltpath&gt... arguments are given, only those paths are
       affected.

OPTIONS
       -d
	   Remove untracked directories in addition to untracked files. If an
	   untracked directory is managed by a different git repository, it is
	   not removed by default. Use -f option twice if you really want to
	   remove such a directory.

       -f, --force
	   If the git configuration variable clean.requireForce is not set to
	   false, git clean will refuse to run unless given -f or -n.

       -n, --dry-run
	   Don't actually remove anything, just show what would be done.

       -q, --quiet
	   Be quiet, only report errors, but not the files that are
	   successfully removed.

       -e &ltpattern&gt, --exclude=&ltpattern&gt
	   In addition to those found in .gitignore (per directory) and
	   $GIT_DIR/info/exclude, also consider these patterns to be in the
	   set of the ignore rules in effect.

       -x
	   Don't use the standard ignore rules read from .gitignore (per
	   directory) and $GIT_DIR/info/exclude, but do still use the ignore
	   rules given with -e options. This allows removing all untracked
	   files, including build products. This can be used (possibly in
	   conjunction with git reset) to create a pristine working directory
	   to test a clean build.

       -X
	   Remove only files ignored by git. This may be useful to rebuild
	   everything from scratch, but keep manually created files.
