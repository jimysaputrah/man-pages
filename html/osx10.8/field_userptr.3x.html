NAME
       form_field_userptr - associate application data with a form field

SYNOPSIS
       #include <form.h>
       int set_field_userptr(FIELD *field, void*userptr);
       void *field_userptr(const FIELD *field);

DESCRIPTION
       Every  form field has a field that can be used to hold application-spe-
       cific data (that is, the form-driver  code  leaves  it  alone).	 These
       functions get and set that field.

RETURN VALUE
       The  function  field_userptr returns a pointer (which may be NULL).  It
       does not set errno.

       The function set_field_userptr returns E_OK (success).

SEE ALSO
       curses(3X), form(3X).

NOTES
       The  header  file  <form.h>  automatically  includes  the  header  file
       <curses.h>.

PORTABILITY
       These  routines emulate the System V forms library.  They were not sup-
       ported on Version 7 or BSD versions.

       The user pointer is a void pointer.  We chose not to leave it as a char
       pointer for SVr4 compatibility.
