NAME
       glUniformBlockBinding - assign a binding point to an active uniform
       block

C SPECIFICATION
       void glUniformBlockBinding(GLuint program, GLuint uniformBlockIndex,
				  GLuint uniformBlockBinding);

PARAMETERS
       program
	   The name of a program object containing the active uniform block
	   whose binding to assign.

       uniformBlockIndex
	   The index of the active uniform block within program whose binding
	   to assign.

       uniformBlockBinding
	   Specifies the binding point to which to bind the uniform block with
	   index uniformBlockIndex within program.

DESCRIPTION
       Binding points for active uniform blocks are assigned using
       glUniformBlockBinding. Each of a program's active uniform blocks has a
       corresponding uniform buffer binding point.  program is the name of a
       program object for which the command glLinkProgram() has been issued in
       the past.

       If successful, glUniformBlockBinding specifies that program will use
       the data store of the buffer object bound to the binding point
       uniformBlockBinding to extract the values of the uniforms in the
       uniform block identified by uniformBlockIndex.

       When a program object is linked or re-linked, the uniform buffer object
       binding point assigned to each of its active uniform blocks is reset to
       zero.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if uniformBlockIndex is not an active
       uniform block index of program.


       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if uniformBlockBinding is greater than or
       equal to the value of GL_MAX_UNIFORM_BUFFER_BINDINGS.


       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated program is not the name of a program
       object generated by the GL.

NOTES
       glUniformBlockBinding is available only if the GL version is 3.1 or
       greater.

ASSOCIATED GETS
       glGetActiveUniformBlock() with argument GL_UNIFORM_BLOCK_BINDING
