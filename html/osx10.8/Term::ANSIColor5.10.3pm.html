DESCRIPTION
       This module has two interfaces, one through color() and colored() and
       the other through constants.  It also offers the utility function
       uncolor(), which has to be explicitly imported to be used (see
       "SYNOPSIS").

       color() takes any number of strings as arguments and considers them to
       be space-separated lists of attributes.	It then forms and returns the
       escape sequence to set those attributes.  It doesn't print it out, just
       returns it, so you'll have to print it yourself if you want to (this is
       so that you can save it as a string, pass it to something else, send it
       to a file handle, or do anything else with it that you might care to).

       uncolor() performs the opposite translation, turning escape sequences
       into a list of strings.

       The recognized non-color attributes are clear, reset, bold, dark,
       faint, underline, underscore, blink, reverse, and concealed.  Clear and
       reset (reset to default attributes), dark and faint (dim and
       saturated), and underline and underscore are equivalent, so use
       whichever is the most intuitive to you.	The recognized foreground
       color attributes are black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan,
       and white.  The recognized background color attributes are on_black,
       on_red, on_green, on_yellow, on_blue, on_magenta, on_cyan, and
       on_white.  Case is not significant.

       Note that not all attributes are supported by all terminal types, and
       some terminals may not support any of these sequences.  Dark and faint,
       blink, and concealed in particular are frequently not implemented.

       Attributes, once set, last until they are unset (by sending the
       attribute "clear" or "reset").  Be careful to do this, or otherwise
       your attribute will last after your script is done running, and people
       get very annoyed at having their prompt and typing changed to weird
       colors.

       As an aid to help with this, colored() takes a scalar as the first
       argument and any number of attribute strings as the second argument and
       returns the scalar wrapped in escape codes so that the attributes will
       be set as requested before the string and reset to normal after the
       string.	Alternately, you can pass a reference to an array as the first
       argument, and then the contents of that array will be taken as
       attributes and color codes and the remainder of the arguments as text
       to colorize.

       Normally, colored() just puts attribute codes at the beginning and end
       of the string, but if you set $Term::ANSIColor::EACHLINE to some
       string, that string will be considered the line delimiter and the
       attribute will be set at the beginning of each line of the passed
       string and reset at the end of each line.  This is often desirable if
       the output contains newlines and you're using background colors, since
       a background color that persists across a newline is often interpreted
       by the terminal as providing the default background color for the next
       line.  Programs like pagers can also be confused by attributes that
       span lines.  Normally you'll want to set $Term::ANSIColor::EACHLINE to
       "\n" to use this feature.

       Alternately, if you import ":constants", you can use the constants
       CLEAR, RESET, BOLD, DARK, UNDERLINE, UNDERSCORE, BLINK, REVERSE,
       CONCEALED, BLACK, RED, GREEN, YELLOW, BLUE, MAGENTA, CYAN, WHITE,
       ON_BLACK, ON_RED, ON_GREEN, ON_YELLOW, ON_BLUE, ON_MAGENTA, ON_CYAN,
       and ON_WHITE directly.  These are the same as color('attribute') and
       can be used if you prefer typing:

	   print BOLD BLUE ON_WHITE "Text", RESET, "\n";

       to

	   print colored ("Text", 'bold blue on_white'), "\n";

       (Note that the newline is kept separate to avoid confusing the terminal
       as described above since a background color is being used.)

       When using the constants, if you don't want to have to remember to add
       the ", RESET" at the end of each print line, you can set
       $Term::ANSIColor::AUTORESET to a true value.  Then, the display mode
       will automatically be reset if there is no comma after the constant.
       In other words, with that variable set:

	   print BOLD BLUE "Text\n";

       will reset the display mode afterward, whereas:

	   print BOLD, BLUE, "Text\n";

       will not.  If you are using background colors, you will probably want
       to print the newline with a separate print statement to avoid confusing
       the terminal.

       The subroutine interface has the advantage over the constants interface
       in that only two subroutines are exported into your namespace, versus
       twenty-two in the constants interface.  On the flip side, the constants
       interface has the advantage of better compile time error checking,
       since misspelled names of colors or attributes in calls to color() and
       colored() won't be caught until runtime whereas misspelled names of
       constants will be caught at compile time.  So, pollute your namespace
       with almost two dozen subroutines that you may not even use that often,
       or risk a silly bug by mistyping an attribute.  Your choice, TMTOWTDI
       after all.

       As of Term::ANSIColor 2.0, you can import ":pushpop" and maintain a
       stack of colors using PUSHCOLOR, POPCOLOR, and LOCALCOLOR.  PUSHCOLOR
       takes the attribute string that starts its argument and pushes it onto
       a stack of attributes.  POPCOLOR removes the top of the stack and
       restores the previous attributes set by the argument of a prior
       PUSHCOLOR.  LOCALCOLOR surrounds its argument in a PUSHCOLOR and
       POPCOLOR so that the color resets afterward.

       When using PUSHCOLOR, POPCOLOR, and LOCALCOLOR, it's particularly
       important to not put commas between the constants.

	   print PUSHCOLOR BLUE "Text\n";

       will correctly push BLUE onto the top of the stack.

	   print PUSHCOLOR, BLUE, "Text\n";    # wrong!

       will not, and a subsequent pop won't restore the correct attributes.
       PUSHCOLOR pushes the attributes set by its argument, which is normally
       a string of color constants.  It can't ask the terminal what the
       current attributes are.

DIAGNOSTICS
       Bad escape sequence %s
	   (F) You passed an invalid ANSI escape sequence to uncolor().

       Bareword "%s" not allowed while "strict subs" in use
	   (F) You probably mistyped a constant color name such as:

	       $Foobar = FOOBAR . "This line should be blue\n";

	   or:

	       @Foobar = FOOBAR, "This line should be blue\n";

	   This will only show up under use strict (another good reason to run
	   under use strict).

       Invalid attribute name %s
	   (F) You passed an invalid attribute name to either color() or
	   colored().

       Name "%s" used only once: possible typo
	   (W) You probably mistyped a constant color name such as:

	       print FOOBAR "This text is color FOOBAR\n";

	   It's probably better to always use commas after constant names in
	   order to force the next error.

       No comma allowed after filehandle
	   (F) You probably mistyped a constant color name such as:

	       print FOOBAR, "This text is color FOOBAR\n";

	   Generating this fatal compile error is one of the main advantages
	   of using the constants interface, since you'll immediately know if
	   you mistype a color name.

       No name for escape sequence %s
	   (F) The ANSI escape sequence passed to uncolor() contains escapes
	   which aren't recognized and can't be translated to names.

ENVIRONMENT
       ANSI_COLORS_DISABLED
	   If this environment variable is set, all of the functions defined
	   by this module (color(), colored(), and all of the constants not
	   previously used in the program) will not output any escape
	   sequences and instead will just return the empty string or pass
	   through the original text as appropriate.  This is intended to
	   support easy use of scripts using this module on platforms that
	   don't support ANSI escape sequences.

	   For it to have its proper effect, this environment variable must be
	   set before any color constants are used in the program.

RESTRICTIONS
       It would be nice if one could leave off the commas around the constants
       entirely and just say:

	   print BOLD BLUE ON_WHITE "Text\n" RESET;

       but the syntax of Perl doesn't allow this.  You need a comma after the
       string.	(Of course, you may consider it a bug that commas between all
       the constants aren't required, in which case you may feel free to
       insert commas unless you're using $Term::ANSIColor::AUTORESET or
       PUSHCOLOR/POPCOLOR.)

       For easier debugging, you may prefer to always use the commas when not
       setting $Term::ANSIColor::AUTORESET or PUSHCOLOR/POPCOLOR so that
       you'll get a fatal compile error rather than a warning.

NOTES
       The codes generated by this module are standard terminal control codes,
       complying with ECMA-048 and ISO 6429 (generally referred to as "ANSI
       color" for the color codes).  The non-color control codes (bold, dark,
       italic, underline, and reverse) are part of the earlier ANSI X3.64
       standard for control sequences for video terminals and peripherals.

       Note that not all displays are ISO 6429-compliant, or even
       X3.64-compliant (or are even attempting to be so).  This module will
       not work as expected on displays that do not honor these escape
       sequences, such as cmd.exe, 4nt.exe, and command.com under either
       Windows NT or Windows 2000.  They may just be ignored, or they may
       display as an ESC character followed by some apparent garbage.

       Jean Delvare provided the following table of different common terminal
       emulators and their support for the various attributes and others have
       helped me flesh it out:

		     clear    bold     faint   under	blink	reverse  conceal
	------------------------------------------------------------------------
	xterm	      yes      yes	no	yes	bold	  yes	   yes
	linux	      yes      yes	yes    bold	 yes	  yes	   no
	rxvt	      yes      yes	no	yes  bold/black   yes	   no
	dtterm	      yes      yes	yes	yes    reverse	  yes	   yes
	teraterm      yes    reverse	no	yes    rev/red	  yes	   no
	aixterm      kinda   normal	no	yes	 no	  yes	   yes
	PuTTY	      yes     color	no	yes	 no	  yes	   no
	Windows       yes      no	no	no	 no	  yes	   no
	Cygwin SSH    yes      yes	no     color	color	 color	   yes
	Mac Terminal  yes      yes	no	yes	 yes	  yes	   yes

       Windows is Windows telnet, Cygwin SSH is the OpenSSH implementation
       under Cygwin on Windows NT, and Mac Terminal is the Terminal
       application in Mac OS X.  Where the entry is other than yes or no, that
       emulator displays the given attribute as something else instead.  Note
       that on an aixterm, clear doesn't reset colors; you have to explicitly
       set the colors back to what you want.  More entries in this table are
       welcome.

       Note that codes 3 (italic), 6 (rapid blink), and 9 (strike-through) are
       specified in ANSI X3.64 and ECMA-048 but are not commonly supported by
       most displays and emulators and therefore aren't supported by this
       module at the present time.  ECMA-048 also specifies a large number of
       other attributes, including a sequence of attributes for font changes,
       Fraktur characters, double-underlining, framing, circling, and
       overlining.  As none of these attributes are widely supported or
       useful, they also aren't currently supported by this module.

SEE ALSO
       ECMA-048 is available on-line (at least at the time of this writing) at
       <http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/ECMA-048.HTM>.

       ISO 6429 is available from ISO for a charge; the author of this module
       does not own a copy of it.  Since the source material for ISO 6429 was
       ECMA-048 and the latter is available for free, there seems little
       reason to obtain the ISO standard.

       The current version of this module is always available from its web
       site at <http://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/software/ansicolor/>.  It is also
       part of the Perl core distribution as of 5.6.0.
