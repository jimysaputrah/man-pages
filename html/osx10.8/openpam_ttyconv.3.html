DESCRIPTION
     The openpam_ttyconv function is a standard conversation function suitable

     text-based interactive programs.

     The openpam_ttyconv function allows the application to specify a timeout
     for user input by setting the global integer variable
     openpam_ttyconv_timeout to the length of the timeout in seconds.

RETURN VALUES
     The openpam_ttyconv function returns one of the following values:

     [PAM_BUF_ERR]	 Memory buffer error.

     [PAM_CONV_ERR]	 Conversation failure.

     [PAM_SYSTEM_ERR]	 System error.

SEE ALSO
     openpam_nullconv(3), pam(3), pam_prompt(3), pam_strerror(3),
     pam_vprompt(3)

STANDARDS
     The openpam_ttyconv function is an OpenPAM extension.
