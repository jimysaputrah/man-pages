NAME
       glutFullScreen  - requests that the current window be made full screen.

SYNTAX
       #include <GLUT/glut.h>

       void glutFullScreen(void);

DESCRIPTION
       glutFullScreen requests that the current window be  made  full  screen.
       The  exact  semantics of what full screen means may vary by window sys-
       tem. The intent is to make the window as large as possible and  disable
       any  window  decorations or borders added the window system. The window
       width and height are not guaranteed to be the same as the screen  width
       and height, but that is the intent of making a window full screen.

       glutFullScreen is defined to work only on top-level windows.

       The  glutFullScreen requests are not processed immediately. The request
       is executed after returning to the main event loop. This allows	multi-
       ple  glutReshapeWindow, glutPositionWindow, and glutFullScreen requests
       to the same window to be coalesced.

       Subsequent glutReshapeWindow and  glutPositionWindow  requests  on  the
       window will disable the full screen status of the window.

X IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
       In  the	X implementation of GLUT, full screen is implemented by sizing
       and positioning the window to cover the entire screen and  posting  the
       _MOTIF_WM_HINTS property on the window requesting absolutely no decora-
       tions. Non-Motif window managers may not respond to _MOTIF_WM_HINTS.
