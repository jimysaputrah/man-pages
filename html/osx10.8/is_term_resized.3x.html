NAME
       is_term_resized,  resize_term,  resizeterm - change the curses terminal
       size

SYNOPSIS
       #include &ltcurses.h&gt

       bool is_term_resized(int lines, int columns);
       int resize_term(int lines, int columns);
       int resizeterm(int lines, int columns);

DESCRIPTION
       This is an extension to the curses library.  It provides callers with a
       hook into the ncurses data to resize windows, primarily for use by pro-
       grams running in an X Window  terminal  (e.g.,  xterm).	 The  function
       resizeterm  resizes  the  standard and current windows to the specified
       dimensions, and adjusts other bookkeeping  data	used  by  the  ncurses
       library that record the window dimensions.

       Most  of the work is done by the inner function resize_term.  The outer
       function resizeterm adds bookkeeping for the  SIGWINCH  handler.   When
       resizing  the  windows,	resize_term  blank-fills  the  areas  that are
       extended.  The calling application should  fill	in  these  areas  with
       appropriate data.  The resize_term function attempts to resize all win-
       dows.  However, due to the calling convention of pads, it is not possi-
       ble  to	resize	these without additional interaction with the applica-
       tion.

       A support function is_term_resized is provided so that applications can
       check  if  the resize_term function would modify the window structures.
       It returns TRUE if the windows would be modified, and FALSE  otherwise.

RETURN VALUE
       Except as notes, these function return the integer ERR upon failure and
       OK on success.  They will fail if either of  the  dimensions  are  less
       than  or equal to zero, or if an error occurs while (re)allocating mem-
       ory for the windows.

NOTES
       While these functions are intended to be used to support a signal  han-
       dler  (i.e., for SIGWINCH), care should be taken to avoid invoking them
       in a context where malloc or realloc may have been  interrupted,  since
       it uses those functions.

       If  ncurses  is	configured  to	supply	its  own SIGWINCH handler, the
       resizeterm function ungetch's a KEY_RESIZE which will be  read  on  the
       next  call  to  getch.	This  is used to alert an application that the
       screen size has changed, and that it should  repaint  special  features
       such as pads that cannot be done automatically.

       If  the	environment variables LINES or COLUMNS are set, this overrides
       the library's use of the window size obtained from the  operating  sys-
       tem.   Thus,  even if a SIGWINCH is received, no screen size change may
       be recorded.  In that case, no KEY_RESIZE is queued for the  next  call
       to getch; an ERR will be returned instead.
