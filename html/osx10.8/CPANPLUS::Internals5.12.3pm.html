NAME
       CPANPLUS::Internals

SYNOPSIS
	   my $internals   = CPANPLUS::Internals->_init( _conf => $conf );
	   my $backend	   = CPANPLUS::Internals->_retrieve_id( $ID );

DESCRIPTION
       This module is the guts of CPANPLUS -- it inherits from all other
       modules in the CPANPLUS::Internals::* namespace, thus defying normal
       rules of OO programming -- but if you're reading this, you already know
       what's going on ;)

       Please read the "CPANPLUS::Backend" documentation for the normal API.

ACCESSORS
       _conf
	   Get/set the configure object

       _id Get/set the id

METHODS
   $internals = CPANPLUS::Internals->_init( _conf => CONFIG_OBJ )
       "_init" creates a new CPANPLUS::Internals object.

       You have to pass it a valid "CPANPLUS::Configure" object.

       Returns the object on success, or dies on failure.

   $bool = $internals->_flush( list => \@caches )
       Flushes the designated caches from the "CPANPLUS" object.

       Returns true on success, false if one or more caches could not be be
       flushed.

   $bool = $internals->_register_callback( name => CALLBACK_NAME, code =>
       CODEREF );
       Registers a callback for later use by the internal libraries.

       Here is a list of the currently used callbacks:

       install_prerequisite
	   Is called when the user wants to be "asked" about what to do with
	   prerequisites. Should return a boolean indicating true to install
	   the prerequisite and false to skip it.

       send_test_report
	   Is called when the user should be prompted if he wishes to send the
	   test report. Should return a boolean indicating true to send the
	   test report and false to skip it.

       munge_test_report
	   Is called when the test report message has been composed, giving
	   the user a chance to programatically alter it. Should return the
	   (munged) message to be sent.

       edit_test_report
	   Is called when the user should be prompted to edit test reports
	   about to be sent out by Test::Reporter. Should return a boolean
	   indicating true to edit the test report in an editor and false to
	   skip it.

       proceed_on_test_failure
	   Is called when 'make test' or 'Build test' fails. Should return a
	   boolean indicating whether the install should continue even if the
	   test failed.

       munge_dist_metafile
	   Is called when the "CPANPLUS::Dist::*" metafile is created, like
	   "control" for "CPANPLUS::Dist::Deb", giving the user a chance to
	   programatically alter it. Should return the (munged) text to be
	   written to the metafile.

   $bool = $internals->_add_to_includepath( directories => \@dirs )
       Adds a list of directories to the include path.	This means they get
       added to @INC as well as $ENV{PERL5LIB}.

       Returns true on success, false on failure.

   $id = CPANPLUS::Internals->_last_id
       Return the id of the last object stored.

   $id = CPANPLUS::Internals->_store_id( $internals )
       Store this object; return its id.

   $obj = CPANPLUS::Internals->_retrieve_id( $ID )
       Retrieve an object based on its ID -- return false on error.

   CPANPLUS::Internals->_remove_id( $ID )
       Remove the object marked by $ID from storage.

   @objs = CPANPLUS::Internals->_return_all_objects
       Return all stored objects.
