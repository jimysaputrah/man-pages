NAME
       IO::Socket::INET - Object interface for AF_INET domain sockets

SYNOPSIS
	   use IO::Socket::INET;

DESCRIPTION
       "IO::Socket::INET" provides an object interface to creating and using
       sockets in the AF_INET domain. It is built upon the IO::Socket
       interface and inherits all the methods defined by IO::Socket.

CONSTRUCTOR
       new ( [ARGS] )
	   Creates an "IO::Socket::INET" object, which is a reference to a
	   newly created symbol (see the "Symbol" package). "new" optionally
	   takes arguments, these arguments are in key-value pairs.

	   In addition to the key-value pairs accepted by IO::Socket,
	   "IO::Socket::INET" provides.

	       PeerAddr    Remote host address		&lthostname&gt[:&ltport&gt]
	       PeerHost    Synonym for PeerAddr
	       PeerPort    Remote port or service	&ltservice&gt[(&ltno&gt)] | &ltno&gt
	       LocalAddr   Local host bind address	hostname[:port]
	       LocalHost   Synonym for LocalAddr
	       LocalPort   Local host bind port 	&ltservice&gt[(&ltno&gt)] | &ltno&gt
	       Proto	   Protocol name (or number)	"tcp" | "udp" | ...
	       Type	   Socket type			SOCK_STREAM | SOCK_DGRAM | ...
	       Listen	   Queue size for listen
	       ReuseAddr   Set SO_REUSEADDR before binding
	       Reuse	   Set SO_REUSEADDR before binding (deprecated, prefer ReuseAddr)
	       ReusePort   Set SO_REUSEPORT before binding
	       Broadcast   Set SO_BROADCAST before binding
	       Timeout	   Timeout value for various operations
	       MultiHomed  Try all addresses for multi-homed hosts
	       Blocking    Determine if connection will be blocking mode

	   If "Listen" is defined then a listen socket is created, else if the
	   socket type, which is derived from the protocol, is SOCK_STREAM
	   then connect() is called.

	   Although it is not illegal, the use of "MultiHomed" on a socket
	   which is in non-blocking mode is of little use. This is because the
	   first connect will never fail with a timeout as the connect call
	   will not block.

	   The "PeerAddr" can be a hostname or the IP-address on the
	   "xx.xx.xx.xx" form.	The "PeerPort" can be a number or a symbolic
	   service name.  The service name might be followed by a number in
	   parenthesis which is used if the service is not known by the
	   system.  The "PeerPort" specification can also be embedded in the
	   "PeerAddr" by preceding it with a ":".

	   If "Proto" is not given and you specify a symbolic "PeerPort" port,
	   then the constructor will try to derive "Proto" from the service
	   name.  As a last resort "Proto" "tcp" is assumed.  The "Type"
	   parameter will be deduced from "Proto" if not specified.

	   If the constructor is only passed a single argument, it is assumed
	   to be a "PeerAddr" specification.

	   If "Blocking" is set to 0, the connection will be in nonblocking
	   mode.  If not specified it defaults to 1 (blocking mode).

	   Examples:

	      $sock = IO::Socket::INET-&gtnew(PeerAddr =&gt 'www.perl.org',
					    PeerPort =&gt 'http(80)',
					    Proto    =&gt 'tcp');

	      $sock = IO::Socket::INET-&gtnew(PeerAddr =&gt 'localhost:smtp(25)');

	      $sock = IO::Socket::INET-&gtnew(Listen    =&gt 5,
					    LocalAddr =&gt 'localhost',
					    LocalPort =&gt 9000,
					    Proto     =&gt 'tcp');

	      $sock = IO::Socket::INET-&gtnew('127.0.0.1:25');

	      $sock = IO::Socket::INET-&gtnew(PeerPort  =&gt 9999,
					    PeerAddr  =&gt inet_ntoa(INADDR_BROADCAST),
					    Proto     =&gt udp,
					    LocalAddr =&gt 'localhost',
					    Broadcast =&gt 1 )
					or die "Can't bind : $@\n";

	    NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE

	   As of VERSION 1.18 all IO::Socket objects have autoflush turned on
	   by default. This was not the case with earlier releases.

   METHODS
       sockaddr ()
	   Return the address part of the sockaddr structure for the socket

       sockport ()
	   Return the port number that the socket is using on the local host

       sockhost ()
	   Return the address part of the sockaddr structure for the socket in
	   a text form xx.xx.xx.xx

       peeraddr ()
	   Return the address part of the sockaddr structure for the socket on
	   the peer host

       peerport ()
	   Return the port number for the socket on the peer host.

       peerhost ()
	   Return the address part of the sockaddr structure for the socket on
	   the peer host in a text form xx.xx.xx.xx
