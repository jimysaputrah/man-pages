NAME
       glGetBufferPointerv - return the pointer to a mapped buffer object's
       data store

C SPECIFICATION
       void glGetBufferPointerv(GLenum target, GLenum pname,
				GLvoid ** params);

PARAMETERS
       target
	   Specifies the target buffer object. The symbolic constant must be
	   GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, GL_COPY_READ_BUFFER, GL_COPY_WRITE_BUFFER,
	   GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, GL_PIXEL_PACK_BUFFER,
	   GL_PIXEL_UNPACK_BUFFER, GL_TEXTURE_BUFFER,
	   GL_TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_BUFFER, or GL_UNIFORM_BUFFER.

       pname
	   Specifies the pointer to be returned. The symbolic constant must be
	   GL_BUFFER_MAP_POINTER.

       params
	   Returns the pointer value specified by pname.

DESCRIPTION
       glGetBufferPointerv returns pointer information.  pname is a symbolic
       constant indicating the pointer to be returned, which must be
       GL_BUFFER_MAP_POINTER, the pointer to which the buffer object's data
       store is mapped. If the data store is not currently mapped, NULL is
       returned.  params is a pointer to a location in which to place the
       returned pointer value.

NOTES
       If an error is generated, no change is made to the contents of params.

       The initial value for the pointer is NULL.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if target or pname is not an accepted
       value.


       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if the reserved buffer object name 0
       is bound to target.
