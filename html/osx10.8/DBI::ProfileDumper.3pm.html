NAME
       DBI::ProfileDumper - profile DBI usage and output data to a file

SYNOPSIS
       To profile an existing program using DBI::ProfileDumper, set the
       DBI_PROFILE environment variable and run your program as usual.	For
       example, using bash:

	 DBI_PROFILE=2/DBI::ProfileDumper program.pl

       Then analyze the generated file (dbi.prof) with dbiprof:

	 dbiprof

       You can also activate DBI::ProfileDumper from within your code:

	 use DBI;

	 # profile with default path (2) and output file (dbi.prof)
	 $dbh->{Profile} = "!Statement/DBI::ProfileDumper";

	 # same thing, spelled out
	 $dbh->{Profile} = "!Statement/DBI::ProfileDumper/File:dbi.prof";

	 # another way to say it
	 use DBI::ProfileDumper;
	 $dbh->{Profile} = DBI::ProfileDumper->new(
			       Path => [ '!Statement' ]
			       File => 'dbi.prof' );

	 # using a custom path
	 $dbh->{Profile} = DBI::ProfileDumper->new(
	     Path => [ "foo", "bar" ],
	     File => 'dbi.prof',
	 );

DESCRIPTION
       DBI::ProfileDumper is a subclass of DBI::Profile which dumps profile
       data to disk instead of printing a summary to your screen.  You can
       then use dbiprof to analyze the data in a number of interesting ways,
       or you can roll your own analysis using DBI::ProfileData.

       NOTE: For Apache/mod_perl applications, use DBI::ProfileDumper::Apache.

USAGE
       One way to use this module is just to enable it in your $dbh:

	 $dbh->{Profile} = "1/DBI::ProfileDumper";

       This will write out profile data by statement into a file called
       dbi.prof.  If you want to modify either of these properties, you can
       construct the DBI::ProfileDumper object yourself:

	 use DBI::ProfileDumper;
	 $dbh->{Profile} = DBI::ProfileDumper->new(
	     Path => [ '!Statement' ],
	     File => 'dbi.prof'
	 );

       The "Path" option takes the same values as in DBI::Profile.  The "File"
       option gives the name of the file where results will be collected.  If
       it already exists it will be overwritten.

       You can also activate this module by setting the DBI_PROFILE
       environment variable:

	 $ENV{DBI_PROFILE} = "!Statement/DBI::ProfileDumper";

       This will cause all DBI handles to share the same profiling object.

METHODS
       The following methods are available to be called using the profile
       object.	You can get access to the profile object from the Profile key
       in any DBI handle:

	 my $profile = $dbh->{Profile};

   flush_to_disk
	 $profile->flush_to_disk()

       Flushes all collected profile data to disk and empties the Data hash.
       Returns the filename writen to.	If no profile data has been collected
       then the file is not written and flush_to_disk() returns undef.

       The file is locked while it's being written. A process 'consuming' the
       files while they're being written to, should rename the file first,
       then lock it, then read it, then close and delete it. The "DeleteFiles"
       option to DBI::ProfileData does the right thing.

       This method may be called multiple times during a program run.

   empty
	 $profile->empty()

       Clears the Data hash without writing to disk.

   filename
	 $filename = $profile->filename();

       Get or set the filename.

       The filename can be specified as a CODE reference, in which case the
       referenced code should return the filename to be used. The code will be
       called with the profile object as its first argument.

DATA FORMAT
       The data format written by DBI::ProfileDumper starts with a header
       containing the version number of the module used to generate it.  Then
       a block of variable declarations describes the profile.	After two
       newlines, the profile data forms the body of the file.  For example:

	 DBI::ProfileDumper 2.003762
	 Path = [ '!Statement', '!MethodName' ]
	 Program = t/42profile_data.t

	 + 1 SELECT name FROM users WHERE id = ?
	 + 2 prepare
	 = 1 0.0312958955764771 0.000490069389343262 0.000176072120666504 0.00140702724456787 1023115819.83019 1023115819.86576
	 + 2 execute
	 1 0.0312958955764771 0.000490069389343262 0.000176072120666504 0.00140702724456787 1023115819.83019 1023115819.86576
	 + 2 fetchrow_hashref
	 = 1 0.0312958955764771 0.000490069389343262 0.000176072120666504 0.00140702724456787 1023115819.83019 1023115819.86576
	 + 1 UPDATE users SET name = ? WHERE id = ?
	 + 2 prepare
	 = 1 0.0312958955764771 0.000490069389343262 0.000176072120666504 0.00140702724456787 1023115819.83019 1023115819.86576
	 + 2 execute
	 = 1 0.0312958955764771 0.000490069389343262 0.000176072120666504 0.00140702724456787 1023115819.83019 1023115819.86576

       The lines beginning with "+" signs signify keys.  The number after the
       "+" sign shows the nesting level of the key.  Lines beginning with "="
       are the actual profile data, in the same order as in DBI::Profile.

       Note that the same path may be present multiple times in the data file
       since "format()" may be called more than once.  When read by
       DBI::ProfileData the data points will be merged to produce a single
       data set for each distinct path.

       The key strings are transformed in three ways.  First, all backslashes
       are doubled.  Then all newlines and carriage-returns are transformed
       into "\n" and "\r" respectively.  Finally, any NULL bytes ("\0") are
       entirely removed.  When DBI::ProfileData reads the file the first two
       transformations will be reversed, but NULL bytes will not be restored.
