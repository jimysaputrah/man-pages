NAME
       Locale::Constants - constants for Locale codes

SYNOPSIS
	   use Locale::Constants;

	   $codeset = LOCALE_CODE_ALPHA_2;

DESCRIPTION
       Locale::Constants defines symbols which are used in the four modules
       from the Locale-Codes distribution:

	       Locale::Language
	       Locale::Country
	       Locale::Currency
	       Locale::Script

       Note: at the moment only Locale::Country and Locale::Script support
       more than one code set.

       The symbols defined are used to specify which codes you want to be
       used:

	       LOCALE_CODE_ALPHA_2
	       LOCALE_CODE_ALPHA_3
	       LOCALE_CODE_NUMERIC

       You shouldn't have to "use" this module directly yourself - it is used
       by the three Locale modules, which in turn export the symbols.

KNOWN BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
       None at the moment.
