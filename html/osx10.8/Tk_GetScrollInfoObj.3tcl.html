NAME
       Tk_GetScrollInfo,  Tk_GetScrollInfoObj  - parse arguments for scrolling
       commands

SYNOPSIS
       #include <tk.h>

       int
       Tk_GetScrollInfo(interp, argc, argv, dblPtr, intPtr)

       int
       Tk_GetScrollInfoObj(interp, objc, objv, dblPtr, intPtr)

ARGUMENTS
       Tcl_Interp *interp (in)		Interpreter to use for	error  report-
					ing.

       int argc (in)			Number of strings in argv array.

       const char *argv[] (in)		Argument strings.  These represent the
					entire widget command,	of  which  the
					first  word  is  typically  the widget
					name and the second word is  typically
					xview or yview.

       int objc (in)			Number of Tcl_Obj's in objv array.

       Tcl_Obj *const objv[] (in)	Argument objects.  These represent the
					entire widget command,	of  which  the
					first  word  is  typically  the widget
					name and the second word is  typically
					xview or yview.

       double *dblPtr (out)		Filled	in  with  fraction from moveto
					option, if any.

       int *intPtr (out)		Filled in with line or page count from
					scroll	option, if any.  The value may
					be negative.

DESCRIPTION
       Tk_GetScrollInfo parses the arguments expected by widget scrolling com-
       mands  such  as	xview and yview.  It receives the entire list of words
       that make up a widget  command  and  parses  the  words	starting  with
       argv[2].   The words starting with argv[2] must have one of the follow-
       ing forms:
	      moveto fraction
	      scroll number units
	      scroll number pages

       Any of the moveto, scroll, units, and pages keywords  may  be  abbrevi-
       ated.   If  argv  has  the moveto form, TK_SCROLL_MOVETO is returned as
       result and *dblPtr is filled in with the fraction argument to the  com-
       mand,  which must be a proper real value.  If argv has the scroll form,
       TK_SCROLL_UNITS or TK_SCROLL_PAGES is returned and *intPtr is filled in
       with  the  number  value,  which must be a proper integer.  If an error
       occurs in parsing the arguments, TK_SCROLL_ERROR  is  returned  and  an
       error message is left in interp->result.

       Tk_GetScrollInfoObj is identical in function to Tk_GetScrollInfo.  How-
       ever, Tk_GetScrollInfoObj accepts Tcl_Obj style	arguments,  making  it
       more appropriate for use with new development.
