NAME
       TAP::Parser::YAMLish::Writer - Write YAMLish data

VERSION
       Version 3.17

SYNOPSIS
	   use TAP::Parser::YAMLish::Writer;

	   my $data = {
	       one =&gt 1,
	       two =&gt 2,
	       three =&gt [ 1, 2, 3 ],
	   };

	   my $yw = TAP::Parser::YAMLish::Writer-&gtnew;

	   # Write to an array...
	   $yw-&gtwrite( $data, \@some_array );

	   # ...an open file handle...
	   $yw-&gtwrite( $data, $some_file_handle );

	   # ...a string ...
	   $yw-&gtwrite( $data, \$some_string );

	   # ...or a closure
	   $yw-&gtwrite( $data, sub {
	       my $line = shift;
	       print "$line\n";
	   } );

DESCRIPTION
       Encodes a scalar, hash reference or array reference as YAMLish.

METHODS
   Class Methods
       "new"

	my $writer = TAP::Parser::YAMLish::Writer-&gtnew;

       The constructor "new" creates and returns an empty
       "TAP::Parser::YAMLish::Writer" object.

   Instance Methods
       "write"

	$writer-&gtwrite($obj, $output );

       Encode a scalar, hash reference or array reference as YAML.

	   my $writer = sub {
	       my $line = shift;
	       print SOMEFILE "$line\n";
	   };

	   my $data = {
	       one =&gt 1,
	       two =&gt 2,
	       three =&gt [ 1, 2, 3 ],
	   };

	   my $yw = TAP::Parser::YAMLish::Writer-&gtnew;
	   $yw-&gtwrite( $data, $writer );

       The  $output  argument may be:

       o   a reference to a scalar to append YAML to

       o   the handle of an open file

       o   a reference to an array into which YAML will be pushed

       o   a code reference

       If you supply a code reference the subroutine will be called once for
       each line of output with the line as its only argument. Passed lines
       will have no trailing newline.
