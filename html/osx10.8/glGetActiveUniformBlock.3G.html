NAME
       glGetActiveUniformBlock - query information about an active uniform
       block

C SPECIFICATION
       void glGetActiveUniformBlockiv(GLuint program,
				      GLuint uniformBlockIndex, GLenum pname,
				      GLint params);

PARAMETERS
       program
	   Specifies the name of a program containing the uniform block.

       uniformBlockIndex
	   Specifies the index of the uniform block within program.

       pname
	   Specifies the name of the parameter to query.

       params
	   Specifies the address of a variable to receive the result of the
	   query.

DESCRIPTION
       glGetActiveUniformBlockiv retrieves information about an active uniform
       block within program.


       program must be the name of a program object for which the command
       glLinkProgram() must have been called in the past, although it is not
       required that glLinkProgram() must have succeeded. The link could have
       failed because the number of active uniforms exceeded the limit.


       uniformBlockIndex is an active uniform block index of program, and must
       be less than the value of GL_ACTIVE_UNIFORM_BLOCKS.

       Upon success, the uniform block parameter(s) specified by pname are
       returned in params. If an error occurs, nothing will be written to
       params.

       If pname is GL_UNIFORM_BLOCK_BINDING, then the index of the uniform
       buffer binding point last selected by the uniform block specified by
       uniformBlockIndex for program is returned. If no uniform block has been
       previously specified, zero is returned.

       If pname is GL_UNIFORM_BLOCK_DATA_SIZE, then the
       implementation-dependent minimum total buffer object size, in basic
       machine units, required to hold all active uniforms in the uniform
       block identified by uniformBlockIndex is returned. It is neither
       guaranteed nor expected that a given implementation will arrange
       uniform values as tightly packed in a buffer object. The exception to
       this is the std140 uniform block layout, which guarantees specific
       packing behavior and does not require the application to query for
       offsets and strides. In this case the minimum size may still be
       queried, even though it is determined in advance based only on the
       uniform block declaration.

       If pname is GL_UNIFORM_BLOCK_NAME_LENGTH, then the total length
       (including the nul terminator) of the name of the uniform block
       identified by uniformBlockIndex is returned.

       If pname is GL_UNIFORM_BLOCK_ACTIVE_UNIFORMS, then the number of active
       uniforms in the uniform block identified by uniformBlockIndex is
       returned.

       If pname is GL_UNIFORM_BLOCK_ACTIVE_UNIFORM_INDICES, then a list of the
       active uniform indices for the uniform block identified by
       uniformBlockIndex is returned. The number of elements that will be
       written to params is the value of GL_UNIFORM_BLOCK_ACTIVE_UNIFORMS for
       uniformBlockIndex.

       If pname is GL_UNIFORM_BLOCK_REFERENCED_BY_VERTEX_SHADER,
       GL_UNIFORM_BLOCK_REFERENCED_BY_GEOMETRY_SHADER, or
       GL_UNIFORM_BLOCK_REFERENCED_BY_FRAGMENT_SHADER, then a boolean value
       indicating whether the uniform block identified by uniformBlockIndex is
       referenced by the vertex, geometry, or fragment programming stages of
       program, respectively, is returned.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if uniformBlockIndex is greater than or
       equal to the value of GL_ACTIVE_UNIFORM_BLOCKS or is not the index of
       an active uniform block in program.


       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if pname is not one of the accepted
       tokens.


       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if program is not the name of a
       program object for which glLinkProgram() has been called in the past.

NOTES
       glGetActiveUniformBlockiv is available only if the GL version is 3.1 or
       greater.
