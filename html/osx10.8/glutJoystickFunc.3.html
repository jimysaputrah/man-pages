NAME
       glutJoystickFunc - sets the joystick callback for the current window.

SYNTAX
       #include <GLUT/glut.h>

       void glutJoystickFunc(void (*func)(unsigned int buttonMask,
			    int x, int y, int z), int pollInterval);

ARGUMENTS
       func	 The new joystick callback function.

       pollInterval
		 Joystick polling interval in milliseconds.

DESCRIPTION
       glutJoystickFunc sets the joystick callback for the current window.

       The  joystick  callback is called either due to polling of the joystick
       at the uniform timer interval specified by pollInterval	(in  millisec-
       onds)   or  in  response  to  calling  glutForceJoystickFunc.   If  the
       pollInterval is non-positive, no joystick polling is performed and  the
       GLUT  application  must frequently (usually from an idle callback) call
       glutForceJoystickFunc.

       The joystick buttons are reported by the callback's buttonMask  parame-
       ter.   The  constants  GLUT_JOYSTICK_BUTTON_A (0x1), GLUT_JOYSTICK_BUT-
       TON_B (0x2), GLUT_JOYSTICK_BUTTON_C (0x4),  and	GLUT_JOYSTICK_BUTTON_D
       (0x8) are provided for programming convience.

       The  x, y, and z callback parameters report the X, Y, and Z axes of the
       joystick.  The joystick is centered at (0,0,0).	X, Y, and Z are scaled
       to range between -1000 and 1000.  Moving the joystick left reports neg-
       ative X; right reports positive	X.   Pulling  the  stick  towards  you
       reports	negative  Y;  push the stick away from you reports positive Y.
       If the joystick has a third axis (rudder or up/down), down reports neg-
       ative Z; up reports positive Z.

       Passing a NULL func to glutJoystickFunc disables the generation of joy-
       stick callbacks.  Without a joystick callback registered, glutForceJoy-
       stickFunc does nothing.

       When  a new window is created, no joystick callback is initially regis-
       tered.

LIMITATIONS
       The GLUT joystick callback only reports the first 3 axes  and  32  but-
       tons.  GLUT supports only a single joystick.

GLUT IMPLEMENTATION NOTES FOR X11
       The  GLUT 3.7 implementation of GLUT for X11 supports the joystick API,
       but not joystick input.	A future implementation of GLUT  for  X11  may
       add joystick support.

GLUT IMPLEMENTATION NOTES FOR WIN32
       The GLUT 3.7 implementation of GLUT for Win32 supports the joystick API
       and joystick input, but does so through	the  dated  joySetCapture  and
       joyGetPosEx  Win32  Multimedia  API.  The GLUT 3.7 joystick support for
       Win32 has all the limitations of the Win32 Multimedia API joystick sup-
       port.  A future implementation of GLUT for Win32 may use DirectInput.
