	       print "$psn\t",
		      $psi-&gtprocessName,       " ",
		      $psi-&gtprocessNumber,     " ",
		      $psi-&gtprocessType,       " ",

DESCRIPTION
       Access to Inside Macintosh is essential for proper use of these
       functions.  Explanations of terms, processes and procedures are
       provided there.	Any attempt to use these functions without guidance
       can cause severe errors in your machine, including corruption of data.
       You have been warned.

   Constants
       kNoProcess
       kSystemProcess
       kCurrentProcess
	   Special process IDs.

       launchUseMinimum
       launchDontSwitch
       launchAllow24Bit
       launchInhibitDaemon
	   Launch flags.

       modeDeskAccessory
       modeMultiLaunch

       modeCanBackground
       modeDoesActivateOnFGSwitch
       modeOnlyBackground
       modeGetFrontClicks
       modeGetAppDiedMsg
       mode32BitCompatible
       modeHighLevelEventAware
       modeLocalAndRemoteHLEvents
       modeStationeryAware
       modeUseTextEditServices
       modeDisplayManagerAware
	   Mode flags in SIZE resource.

   LaunchParam
       This Perl hash maps onto the fields of a Launch Parameter Block.

       The fields are:

	   launchFileFlags
	   launchControlFlags
	   launchAppSpec
	   launchAvailableSize
	   launchProcessSN
	   launchPreferredSize
	   launchMinimumSize

       new LaunchParam [ARGUMENTS]
	   Returns LaunchParam.

	       $launch =
		   new LaunchParam(launchAppSpec =E&ltgt&gt "hd:apps:myapp", launchMinimumSize =&gt 32000);

       DESTROY LPB

   ProcessInfo
       This Perl hash allows access to the "ProcessInfo" structure.

       The field names are:

	   processName
	   processNumber
	   processType
	   processSignature
	   processSize
	   processMode
	   processLocation
	   processLauncher
	   processLaunchDate
	   processActiveTime
	   processAppSpec

       DESTROY PI

   Functions
       LaunchApplication LAUNCHPARAMS
	   The LaunchApplication function launches the application from the
	   specified file and returns the process serial number if the
	   application is successfully launched.  Returns undef on failure.

       LaunchDeskAccessory PFILESPEC, PDANAME
	   Mac OS only.

	   The LaunchDeskAccessory function searches the resource fork of the
	   file specified by the pFileSpec parameter for the desk accessory
	   with the 'DRVR' resource name specified in the pDAName parameter.
	   If the 'DRVR' resource name is found, LaunchDeskAccessory launches
	   the corresponding desk accessory. If the desk accessory is already
	   open, it is brought to the front.  Returns zero on failure.

       GetCurrentProcess
	   The GetCurrentProcess function returns the process serial number of
	   the process that is currently running, that is, the one currently
	   accessing the CPU.  Return "undef" if an error was detected.

       GetFrontProcess
	   The GetFrontProcess function returns the process serial number of
	   the process running in the foreground.  Return "undef" if an error
	   was detected.

       GetNextProcess PSN
	   Get information about the next process, if any, in the Process
	   ManagerO~s internal list of open processes.	Return "undef" if an
	   error was detected.

       GetProcessInformation PSN
	   The GetProcessInformation function returns, in a process
	   information record, information about the specified process. The
	   information returned in the info parameter includes the
	   applicationO~s name as it appears in the Application menu, the type
	   and signature of the application, the address of the application
	   partition, the number of bytes in the application partition, the
	   number of free bytes in the application heap, the application that
	   launched the application, the time at which the application was
	   launched, and the location of the application file.	Return "undef"
	   if an error was detected.

       SetFrontProcess PSN
	   The SetFrontProcess function schedules the specified process to
	   move to the foreground. The specified process moves to the
	   foreground after the current foreground process makes a subsequent
	   call to WaitNextEvent or EventAvail.  Returns zero on failure.

       WakeUpProcess PSN
	   The WakeUpProcess function makes a process suspended by
	   WaitNextEvent() eligible to receive CPU time. A process is
	   suspended when the value of the sleep parameter in the
	   WaitNextEvent() function is not 0 and no events for that process
	   are pending in the event queue. This process remains suspended
	   until the time specified in the sleep parameter expires or an event
	   becomes available for that process. You can use WakeUpProcess to
	   make the process eligible for execution before the time specified
	   in the sleep parameter expires.  Returns zero on failure.

       SameProcess PSN1, PSN2
	   The SameProcess function compares two process serial numbers and
	   determines whether they refer to the same process.  Return "undef"
	   if an error was detected.

       ExitToShell
	   This function is not implemented: ExitToShell() unsupported. Use
	   exit.

       GetProcessPID(PSN)
	   Mac OS X only.

	   Get the UNIX process ID corresponding to a process serial number.

       GetProcessForPID(PID)
	   Mac OS X only.

	   Get the process serial number corresponding to a UNIX process ID.

       LSFindApplicationForInfo(creator, bundleID=NULL, name=NULL)
	   Mac OS X only.

	   Return the path to the application matching one or more of creator,
	   bundleID, and name.	Pass undef or empty string for unused
	   parameters.

		   $path = LSFindApplicationForInfo("R*ch");
		   $path = LSFindApplicationForInfo(undef, "com.barebones.bbedit");
		   $path = LSFindApplicationForInfo(undef, undef, "BBEdit.app");
		   $path = LSFindApplicationForInfo("R*ch", "com.barebones.bbedit", "BBEdit.app");
