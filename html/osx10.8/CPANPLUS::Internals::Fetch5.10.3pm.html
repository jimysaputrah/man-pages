NAME
       CPANPLUS::Internals::Fetch

SYNOPSIS
	   my $output = $cb->_fetch(
			       module	   => $modobj,
			       fetchdir    => '/path/to/save/to',
			       verbose	   => BOOL,
			       force	   => BOOL,
			   );

	   $cb->_add_fail_host( host => 'foo.com' );
	   $cb->_host_ok(	host => 'foo.com' );

DESCRIPTION
       CPANPLUS::Internals::Fetch fetches files from either ftp, http, file or
       rsync mirrors.

       This is the rough flow:

	   $cb->_fetch
	       Delegate to File::Fetch;

METHODS
$path = _fetch( module => $modobj, [fetchdir => '/path/to/save/to', fetch_from
       => 'scheme://path/to/fetch/from', verbose => BOOL, force => BOOL,
       prefer_bin => BOOL, ttl => $seconds] )
       "_fetch" will fetch files based on the information in a module object.
       You always need a module object. If you want a fake module object for a
       one-off fetch, look at "CPANPLUS::Module::Fake".

       "fetchdir" is the place to save the file to. Usually this information
       comes from your configuration, but you can override it expressly if
       needed.

       "fetch_from" lets you specify an URI to get this file from. If you do
       not specify one, your list of configured hosts will be probed to
       download the file from.

       "force" forces a new download, even if the file already exists.

       "verbose" simply indicates whether or not to print extra messages.

       "prefer_bin" indicates whether you prefer the use of commandline
       programs over perl modules. Defaults to your corresponding config
       setting.

       "ttl" (in seconds) indicates how long a cached copy is valid for. If
       the fetch time of the local copy is within the ttl, the cached copy is
       returned. Otherwise, the file is refetched.

       "_fetch" figures out, based on the host list, what scheme to use and
       from there, delegates to "File::Fetch" do the actual fetching.

       Returns the path of the output file on success, false on failure.

       Note that you can set a "blacklist" on certain methods in the config.
       Simply add the identifying name of the method (ie, "lwp") to:
	   $conf->_set_fetch( blacklist => ['lwp'] );

       And the "LWP" function will be skipped by "File::Fetch".

   _add_fail_host( host => $host_hashref )
       Mark a particular host as bad. This makes "CPANPLUS::Internals::Fetch"
       skip it in fetches until this cache is flushed.

   _host_ok( host => $host_hashref )
       Query the cache to see if this host is ok, or if it has been flagged as
       bad.

       Returns true if the host is ok, false otherwise.
