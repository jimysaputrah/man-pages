NAME
       glFrontFace - define front- and back-facing polygons

C SPECIFICATION
       void glFrontFace(GLenum mode);

PARAMETERS
       mode
	   Specifies the orientation of front-facing polygons.	GL_CW and
	   GL_CCW are accepted. The initial value is GL_CCW.

DESCRIPTION
       In a scene composed entirely of opaque closed surfaces, back-facing
       polygons are never visible. Eliminating these invisible polygons has
       the obvious benefit of speeding up the rendering of the image. To
       enable and disable elimination of back-facing polygons, call glEnable()
       and glDisable() with argument GL_CULL_FACE.

       The projection of a polygon to window coordinates is said to have
       clockwise winding if an imaginary object following the path from its
       first vertex, its second vertex, and so on, to its last vertex, and
       finally back to its first vertex, moves in a clockwise direction about
       the interior of the polygon. The polygon's winding is said to be
       counterclockwise if the imaginary object following the same path moves
       in a counterclockwise direction about the interior of the polygon.
       glFrontFace specifies whether polygons with clockwise winding in window
       coordinates, or counterclockwise winding in window coordinates, are
       taken to be front-facing. Passing GL_CCW to mode selects
       counterclockwise polygons as front-facing; GL_CW selects clockwise
       polygons as front-facing. By default, counterclockwise polygons are
       taken to be front-facing.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if mode is not an accepted value.

ASSOCIATED GETS
       glGet() with argument GL_FRONT_FACE
