NAMED-CHECKCONF(8)		     BIND9		    NAMED-CHECKCONF(8)



NAME
       named-checkconf - named configuration file syntax checking tool

SYNOPSIS
       named-checkconf [-h] [-v] [-j] [-t directory] {filename} [-p] [-z]

DESCRIPTION
       named-checkconf checks the syntax, but not the semantics, of a named
       configuration file. The file is parsed and checked for syntax errors,
       along with all files included by it. If no file is specified,
       /etc/named.conf is read by default.

       Note: files that named reads in separate parser contexts, such as
       rndc.key and bind.keys, are not automatically read by named-checkconf.
       Configuration errors in these files may cause named to fail to run,
       even if named-checkconf was successful.	named-checkconf can be run on
       these files explicitly, however.

OPTIONS
       -h
	   Print the usage summary and exit.

       -t directory
	   Chroot to directory so that include directives in the configuration
	   file are processed as if run by a similarly chrooted named.

       -v
	   Print the version of the named-checkconf program and exit.

       -p
	   Print out the named.conf and included files in canonical form if no
	   errors were detected.

       -z
	   Perform a test load of all master zones found in named.conf.

       -j
	   When loading a zonefile read the journal if it exists.

       filename
	   The name of the configuration file to be checked. If not specified,
	   it defaults to /etc/named.conf.

RETURN VALUES
       named-checkconf returns an exit status of 1 if errors were detected and
       0 otherwise.
