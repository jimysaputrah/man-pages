Time::Piece(3pm)       Perl Programmers Reference Guide       Time::Piece(3pm)



NAME
       Time::Piece - Object Oriented time objects

SYNOPSIS
	   use Time::Piece;

	   my $t = localtime;
	   print "Time is $t\n";
	   print "Year is ", $t-&gtyear, "\n";

DESCRIPTION
       This module replaces the standard localtime and gmtime functions with
       implementations that return objects. It does so in a backwards
       compatible manner, so that using localtime/gmtime in the way documented
       in perlfunc will still return what you expect.

       The module actually implements most of an interface described by Larry
       Wall on the perl5-porters mailing list here:
       http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2000-01/msg00241.html

USAGE
       After importing this module, when you use localtime or gmtime in a
       scalar context, rather than getting an ordinary scalar string
       representing the date and time, you get a Time::Piece object, whose
       stringification happens to produce the same effect as the localtime and
       gmtime functions. There is also a new() constructor provided, which is
       the same as localtime(), except when passed a Time::Piece object, in
       which case it's a copy constructor. The following methods are available
       on the object:

	   $t-&gtsec		   # also available as $t-&gtsecond
	   $t-&gtmin		   # also available as $t-&gtminute
	   $t-&gthour		   # 24 hour
	   $t-&gtmday		   # also available as $t-&gtday_of_month
	   $t-&gtmon		   # 1 = January
	   $t-&gt_mon		   # 0 = January
	   $t-&gtmonname		   # Feb
	   $t-&gtmonth		   # same as $t-&gtmonname
	   $t-&gtfullmonth	   # February
	   $t-&gtyear		   # based at 0 (year 0 AD is, of course 1 BC)
	   $t-&gt_year		   # year minus 1900
	   $t-&gtyy		   # 2 digit year
	   $t-&gtwday		   # 1 = Sunday
	   $t-&gt_wday		   # 0 = Sunday
	   $t-&gtday_of_week	   # 0 = Sunday
	   $t-&gtwdayname 	   # Tue
	   $t-&gtday		   # same as wdayname
	   $t-&gtfullday		   # Tuesday
	   $t-&gtyday		   # also available as $t-&gtday_of_year, 0 = Jan 01
	   $t-&gtisdst		   # also available as $t-&gtdaylight_savings

	   $t-&gthms		   # 12:34:56
	   $t-&gthms(".") 	   # 12.34.56
	   $t-&gttime		   # same as $t-&gthms

	   $t-&gtymd		   # 2000-02-29
	   $t-&gtdate		   # same as $t-&gtymd
	   $t-&gtmdy		   # 02-29-2000
	   $t-&gtmdy("/") 	   # 02/29/2000
	   $t-&gtdmy		   # 29-02-2000
	   $t-&gtdmy(".") 	   # 29.02.2000
	   $t-&gtdatetime 	   # 2000-02-29T12:34:56 (ISO 8601)
	   $t-&gtcdate		   # Tue Feb 29 12:34:56 2000
	   "$t" 		   # same as $t-&gtcdate

	   $t-&gtepoch		   # seconds since the epoch
	   $t-&gttzoffset 	   # timezone offset in a Time::Seconds object

	   $t-&gtjulian_day	   # number of days since Julian period began
	   $t-&gtmjd		   # modified Julian date (JD-2400000.5 days)

	   $t-&gtweek		   # week number (ISO 8601)

	   $t-&gtis_leap_year	   # true if it its
	   $t-&gtmonth_last_day	   # 28-31

	   $t-&gttime_separator($s)  # set the default separator (default ":")
	   $t-&gtdate_separator($s)  # set the default separator (default "-")
	   $t-&gtday_list(@days)	   # set the default weekdays
	   $t-&gtmon_list(@days)	   # set the default months

	   $t-&gtstrftime(FORMAT)    # same as POSIX::strftime (without the overhead
				   # of the full POSIX extension)
	   $t-&gtstrftime()	   # "Tue, 29 Feb 2000 12:34:56 GMT"

	   Time::Piece-&gtstrptime(STRING, FORMAT)
				   # see strptime man page. Creates a new
				   # Time::Piece object

   Local Locales
       Both wdayname (day) and monname (month) allow passing in a list to use
       to index the name of the days against. This can be useful if you need
       to implement some form of localisation without actually installing or
       using locales.

	 my @days = qw( Dimanche Lundi Merdi Mercredi Jeudi Vendredi Samedi );

	 my $french_day = localtime-&gtday(@days);

       These settings can be overriden globally too:

	 Time::Piece::day_list(@days);

       Or for months:

	 Time::Piece::mon_list(@months);

       And locally for months:

	 print localtime-&gtmonth(@months);

   Date Calculations
       It's possible to use simple addition and subtraction of objects:

	   use Time::Seconds;

	   my $seconds = $t1 - $t2;
	   $t1 += ONE_DAY; # add 1 day (constant from Time::Seconds)

       The following are valid ($t1 and $t2 are Time::Piece objects):

	   $t1 - $t2; # returns Time::Seconds object
	   $t1 - 42; # returns Time::Piece object
	   $t1 + 533; # returns Time::Piece object

       However adding a Time::Piece object to another Time::Piece object will
       cause a runtime error.

       Note that the first of the above returns a Time::Seconds object, so
       while examining the object will print the number of seconds (because of
       the overloading), you can also get the number of minutes, hours, days,
       weeks and years in that delta, using the Time::Seconds API.

       In addition to adding seconds, there are two APIs for adding months and
       years:

	   $t-&gtadd_months(6);
	   $t-&gtadd_years(5);

       The months and years can be negative for subtractions. Note that there
       is some "strange" behaviour when adding and subtracting months at the
       ends of months. Generally when the resulting month is shorter than the
       starting month then the number of overlap days is added. For example
       subtracting a month from 2008-03-31 will not result in 2008-02-31 as
       this is an impossible date. Instead you will get 2008-03-02. This
       appears to be consistent with other date manipulation tools.

   Date Comparisons
       Date comparisons are also possible, using the full suite of "&lt", "&gt",
       "&lt=", "&gt=", "&lt=&gt", "==" and "!=".

   Date Parsing
       Time::Piece links to your C library's strptime() function, allowing you
       incredibly flexible date parsing routines. For example:

	 my $t = Time::Piece-&gtstrptime("Sun 3rd Nov, 1943",
				       "%A %drd %b, %Y");

	 print $t-&gtstrftime("%a, %d %b %Y");

       Outputs:

	 Wed, 03 Nov 1943

       (see, it's even smart enough to fix my obvious date bug)

       For more information see "man strptime", which should be on all unix
       systems.

   YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss
       The ISO 8601 standard defines the date format to be YYYY-MM-DD, and the
       time format to be hh:mm:ss (24 hour clock), and if combined, they
       should be concatenated with date first and with a capital 'T' in front
       of the time.

   Week Number
       The week number may be an unknown concept to some readers.  The ISO
       8601 standard defines that weeks begin on a Monday and week 1 of the
       year is the week that includes both January 4th and the first Thursday
       of the year.  In other words, if the first Monday of January is the
       2nd, 3rd, or 4th, the preceding days of the January are part of the
       last week of the preceding year.  Week numbers range from 1 to 53.

   Global Overriding
       Finally, it's possible to override localtime and gmtime everywhere, by
       including the ':override' tag in the import list:

	   use Time::Piece ':override';

CAVEATS
   Setting $ENV{TZ} in Threads on Win32
       Note that when using perl in the default build configuration on Win32
       (specifically, when perl is built with PERL_IMPLICIT_SYS), each perl
       interpreter maintains its own copy of the environment and only the main
       interpreter will update the process environment seen by strftime.

       Therefore, if you make changes to $ENV{TZ} from inside a thread other
       than the main thread then those changes will not be seen by strftime if
       you subsequently call that with the %Z formatting code. You must change
       $ENV{TZ} in the main thread to have the desired effect in this case
       (and you must also call _tzset() in the main thread to register the
       environment change).

       Furthermore, remember that this caveat also applies to fork(), which is
       emulated by threads on Win32.
