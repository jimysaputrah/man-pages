NAME
       sasl_encode - Encode data for transport to authenticated host



SYNOPSIS
       #include &ltsasl/sasl.h&gt


       int sasl_encode(sasl_conn_t *conn,
		      const char * input,
			 unsigned inputlen,
		      const char ** output,
		      unsigned * outputlen);

       int sasl_encodev(sasl_conn_t *conn,
		      const struct iovec * invec,
			 unsigned numiov,
		      const char ** output,
		      unsigned * outputlen);


DESCRIPTION
       sasl_encode  encodes  data  to  be sent to be sent to a remote host who
       we've had a successful authentication session with. If there is a nego-
       tiated  security  the data in signed/encrypted and the output should be
       sent without modification to the remote host. If there is  no  security
       layer the output is identical to the input.

       sasl_encodev does the same, but for a struct iovec instead of a charac-
       ter buffer.

       output contains the encoded data and is allocated/freed by the library.


RETURN VALUE
       Returns	SASL_OK  on success.  See sasl_errors(3) for meanings of other
       return codes.


CONFORMING TO
       RFC 2222
