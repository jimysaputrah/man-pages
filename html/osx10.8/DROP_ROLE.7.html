DROP ROLE(7)		PostgreSQL 9.1.4 Documentation		  DROP ROLE(7)



NAME
       DROP_ROLE - remove a database role

SYNOPSIS
       DROP ROLE [ IF EXISTS ] name [, ...]

DESCRIPTION
       DROP ROLE removes the specified role(s). To drop a superuser role, you
       must be a superuser yourself; to drop non-superuser roles, you must
       have CREATEROLE privilege.

       A role cannot be removed if it is still referenced in any database of
       the cluster; an error will be raised if so. Before dropping the role,
       you must drop all the objects it owns (or reassign their ownership) and
       revoke any privileges the role has been granted. The REASSIGN OWNED
       (REASSIGN_OWNED(7)) and DROP OWNED (DROP_OWNED(7)) commands can be
       useful for this purpose.

       However, it is not necessary to remove role memberships involving the
       role; DROP ROLE automatically revokes any memberships of the target
       role in other roles, and of other roles in the target role. The other
       roles are not dropped nor otherwise affected.

PARAMETERS
       IF EXISTS
	   Do not throw an error if the role does not exist. A notice is
	   issued in this case.

       name
	   The name of the role to remove.

NOTES
       PostgreSQL includes a program dropuser(1) that has the same
       functionality as this command (in fact, it calls this command) but can
       be run from the command shell.

EXAMPLES
       To drop a role:

	   DROP ROLE jonathan;

COMPATIBILITY
       The SQL standard defines DROP ROLE, but it allows only one role to be
       dropped at a time, and it specifies different privilege requirements
       than PostgreSQL uses.

SEE ALSO
       CREATE ROLE (CREATE_ROLE(7)), ALTER ROLE (ALTER_ROLE(7)), SET ROLE
       (SET_ROLE(7))
