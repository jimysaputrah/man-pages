POSIX_SPAWNATTR_SETFL... BSD Library Functions Manual POSIX_SPAWNATTR_SETFL...

NAME
     posix_spawnattr_setflags posix_spawnattr_getflags -- get or set flags on
     a posix_spawnattr_t

SYNOPSIS
     #include <spawn.h>

     int
     posix_spawnattr_setflags(posix_spawnattr_t *attr, short flags);

     int
     posix_spawnattr_getflags(const posix_spawnattr_t *restrict attr,
	 short *restrict flags);

DESCRIPTION
     The posix_spawnattr_setflags() function sets the flags on the attributes
     object referenced by attr.

     The posix_spawnattr_getflags() function retrieves the flags on the
     attributes object referenced by attr.

     The argument flags is either 0 or a logical OR of one or more of the fol-
     lowing flags:

     POSIX_SPAWN_RESETIDS	  If this bit is set, the child process will
				  inherit the real (rather than the effective)
				  user and group ID of the parent process.
				  NOTE: This flag has no effect when the set-
				  group bit is set on the process image being
				  spawned.

     POSIX_SPAWN_SETPGROUP	  If this bit is not set, then the child
				  process inherits the parent process group;
				  if it is set, then the child process will
				  behave as if the setpgid(2) function had
				  been called with a pid parameter of 0 and a
				  pgid parameter equal to the value of the
				  spawn-pgroup value of the posix_spawnattr_t,
				  as set by posix_spawnattr_setpgroup(3)

     POSIX_SPAWN_SETSIGDEF	  Signals set to to either be caught or to the
				  default action in the parent process will
				  also be set to the default action in the
				  child process.  Signals set to be ignored in
				  the parent process will be ignored in the
				  child.  However, if this bit is set, then
				  signals in the spawn-sigdefault value of the
				  posix_spawnattr_t, as set by
				  posix_spawnattr_setsigdefault(3) which are
				  caught or ignored in the parent will instead
				  be reset to their default actions in the
				  child.

     POSIX_SPAWN_SETSIGMASK	  If this bit is set, then the initial signal
				  mask of the child process will be set to the
				  spawn-sigmask value of the
				  posix_spawnattr_t, as set by
				  posix_spawnattr_setsigmask(3).

     POSIX_SPAWN_SETEXEC	  Apple Extension: If this bit is set, rather
				  than returning to the caller, posix_spawn(2)
				  and posix_spawnp(2) will behave as a more
				  featureful execve(2).

     POSIX_SPAWN_START_SUSPENDED  Apple Extension: If this bit is set, then
				  the child process will be created with its
				  task suspended, permitting debuggers, pro-
				  filers, and other programs to manipulate the
				  process before it begins execution in user
				  space.  This permits, for example, obtaining
				  exact instruction counts, or debugging very
				  early in dyld(1).

     POSIX_SPAWN_CLOEXEC_DEFAULT  Apple Extension: If this bit is set, then
				  only file descriptors explicitly described
				  by the file_actions argument are available
				  in the spawned process; all of the other
				  file descriptors are automatically closed in
				  the spawned process.

RETURN VALUES
     On success, these functions return 0; on failure they return an error
     number from <errno.h>.  The posix_spawnattr_getflags() additionally, upon
     successful completion, modifies the value pointed to be the attr argument
     by making it equal to the spawn-flags attribute of the posix_spawnattr_t.

ERRORS
     These functions may fail if:

     [EINVAL]		The value specified by attr is invalid.

     [EINVAL]		The value of attr is invalid.
