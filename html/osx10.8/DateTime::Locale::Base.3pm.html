NAME
       DateTime::Locale::Base - Base class for individual locale objects

SYNOPSIS
	 use base 'DateTime::Locale::Base';

DEFAULT FORMATS
       Each locale has a set of four default date and time formats.  They are
       distinguished by length, and are called "full", "long", "medium", and
       "short". Each locale may have a different default length which it uses
       when its "$locale->date_format_default()",
       "$locale->time_format_default()", or
       "$locale->datetime_format_default()" methods are called.

       This can be changed by calling the "$locale->set_default_date_format()"
       or "$locale->set_default_time_format()" methods.  These methods accept
       a string which must be one of "full", "long", "medium", or "short".

NAME FORMS
       Most names come in a number of variations. First, they may vary based
       on length, with wide, abbreviated, and narrow forms. The wide form is
       typically the full name, while the narrow form is often a single
       character. The narrow forms may not be unique. For example, "T" may be
       used for Tuesday and Thursday in the English narrow forms.

       Many names also distinguish between "format" and "stand-alone" forms of
       a pattern. The format pattern is used when the thing in question is
       being placed into a larger string. The stand-alone form is used when
       displaying that item by itself, for example in a calendar.
