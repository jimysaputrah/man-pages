ALTER SCHEMA(7) 	PostgreSQL 9.1.4 Documentation	       ALTER SCHEMA(7)



NAME
       ALTER_SCHEMA - change the definition of a schema

SYNOPSIS
       ALTER SCHEMA name RENAME TO new_name
       ALTER SCHEMA name OWNER TO new_owner

DESCRIPTION
       ALTER SCHEMA changes the definition of a schema.

       You must own the schema to use ALTER SCHEMA. To rename a schema you
       must also have the CREATE privilege for the database. To alter the
       owner, you must also be a direct or indirect member of the new owning
       role, and you must have the CREATE privilege for the database. (Note
       that superusers have all these privileges automatically.)

PARAMETERS
       name
	   The name of an existing schema.

       new_name
	   The new name of the schema. The new name cannot begin with pg_, as
	   such names are reserved for system schemas.

       new_owner
	   The new owner of the schema.

COMPATIBILITY
       There is no ALTER SCHEMA statement in the SQL standard.

SEE ALSO
       CREATE SCHEMA (CREATE_SCHEMA(7)), DROP SCHEMA (DROP_SCHEMA(7))
