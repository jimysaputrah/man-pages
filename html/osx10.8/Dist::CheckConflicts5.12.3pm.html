NAME
       Dist::CheckConflicts - declare version conflicts for your dist

VERSION
       version 0.02

SYNOPSIS
	   use Dist::CheckConflicts
	       -dist => 'Class-MOP',
	       -conflicts => {
		   'Moose'		  => '1.14',
		   'namespace::autoclean' => '0.08',
	       },
	       -also => [
		   'Package::Stash::Conflicts',
	       ];

	   __PACKAGE__->check_conflicts;

DESCRIPTION
       One shortcoming of the CPAN clients that currently exist is that they
       have no way of specifying conflicting downstream dependencies of
       modules. This module attempts to work around this issue by allowing you
       to specify conflicting versions of modules separately, and deal with
       them after the module is done installing.

       For instance, say you have a module "Foo", and some other module "Bar"
       uses "Foo". If "Foo" were to change its API in a non-backwards-
       compatible way, this would cause "Bar" to break until it is updated to
       use the new API. "Foo" can't just depend on the fixed version of "Bar",
       because this will cause a circular dependency (because "Bar" is already
       depending on "Foo"), and this doesn't express intent properly anyway -
       "Foo" doesn't use "Bar" at all. The ideal solution would be for there
       to be a way to specify conflicting versions of modules in a way that
       would let CPAN clients update conflicting modules automatically after
       an existing module is upgraded, but until that happens, this module
       will allow users to do this manually.

       This module accepts a hash of options passed to its "use" statement,
       with these keys being valid:

       -conflicts
	   A hashref of conflict specifications, where keys are module names,
	   and values are the last broken version - any version greater than
	   the specified version should work.

       -also
	   Additional modules to get conflicts from (potentially recursively).
	   This should generally be a list of modules which use
	   Dist::CheckConflicts, which correspond to the dists that your dist
	   depends on. (In an ideal world, this would be intuited directly
	   from your dependency list, but the dependency list isn't available
	   outside of build time).

       -dist
	   The name of the distribution, to make the error message from
	   check_conflicts more user-friendly.

       The methods listed below are exported by this module into the module
       that uses it, so you should call these methods on your module, not
       Dist::CheckConflicts.

       As an example, this command line can be used to update your modules,
       after installing the "Foo" dist (assuming that "Foo::Conflicts" is the
       module in the "Foo" dist which uses Dist::CheckConflicts):

	   perl -MFoo::Conflicts -e'print "$_\n"
	       for map { $_->{package} } Foo::Conflicts->calculate_conflicts' | cpanm

METHODS
   conflicts
       Returns the conflict specification (the "-conflicts" parameter to
       "import()"), as a hash.

   dist
       Returns the dist name (either as specified by the "-dist" parameter to
       "import()", or the package name which "use"d this module).

   check_conflicts
       Examine the modules that are currently installed, and throw an
       exception with useful information if any modules are at versions which
       conflict with the dist.

   calculate_conflicts
       Examine the modules that are currently installed, and return a list of
       modules which conflict with the dist. The modules will be returned as a
       list of hashrefs, each containing "package", "installed", and
       "required" keys.

TODO
       Provide a way to insert a hook into @INC which warns if a conflicting
       module is loaded (would this be reasonable?)
