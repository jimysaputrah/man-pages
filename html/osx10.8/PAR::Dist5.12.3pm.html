PAR::Dist(3)	      User Contributed Perl Documentation	  PAR::Dist(3)



NAME
       PAR::Dist - Create and manipulate PAR distributions

VERSION
       This document describes version 0.47 of PAR::Dist, released November
       29, 2009.

SYNOPSIS
       As a shell command:

	   % perl -MPAR::Dist -eblib_to_par

       In programs:

	   use PAR::Dist;

	   my $dist = blib_to_par();   # make a PAR file using ./blib/
	   install_par($dist);	       # install it into the system
	   uninstall_par($dist);       # uninstall it from the system
	   sign_par($dist);	       # sign it using Module::Signature
	   verify_par($dist);	       # verify it using Module::Signature

	   install_par("http://foo.com/DBI-1.37-MSWin32-5.8.0.par"); # works too
	   install_par("http://foo.com/DBI-1.37"); # auto-appends archname + perlver
	   install_par("cpan://SMUELLER/PAR-Packer-0.975"); # uses CPAN author directory

DESCRIPTION
       This module creates and manipulates PAR distributions.  They are
       architecture-specific PAR files, containing everything under blib/ of
       CPAN distributions after their "make" or "Build" stage, a META.yml
       describing metadata of the original CPAN distribution, and a MANIFEST
       detailing all files within it.  Digitally signed PAR distributions will
       also contain a SIGNATURE file.

       The naming convention for such distributions is:

	   $NAME-$VERSION-$ARCH-$PERL_VERSION.par

       For example, "PAR-Dist-0.01-i386-freebsd-5.8.0.par" corresponds to the
       0.01 release of "PAR-Dist" on CPAN, built for perl 5.8.0 running on
       "i386-freebsd".

FUNCTIONS
       Several functions are exported by default.  Unless otherwise noted,
       they can take either a hash of named arguments, a single argument
       (taken as $path by "blib_to_par" and $dist by other functions), or no
       arguments (in which case the first PAR file in the current directory is
       used).

       Therefore, under a directory containing only a single test.par, all
       invocations below are equivalent:

	   % perl -MPAR::Dist -e"install_par( dist =&gt 'test.par' )"
	   % perl -MPAR::Dist -e"install_par( 'test.par' )"
	   % perl -MPAR::Dist -einstall_par;

       If $dist resembles a URL, "LWP::Simple::mirror" is called to mirror it
       locally under $ENV{PAR_TEMP} (or "$TEMP/par/" if unspecified), and the
       function will act on the fetched local file instead.  If the URL begins
       with "cpan://AUTHOR/", it will be expanded automatically to the
       author's CPAN directory (e.g.
       "http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-authors/id/A/AU/AUTHOR/").

       If $dist does not have a file extension beginning with a letter or
       underscore, a dash and $suffix ($ARCH-$PERL_VERSION.par by default)
       will be appended to it.

   blib_to_par
       Takes key/value pairs as parameters or a single parameter indicating
       the path that contains the blib/ subdirectory.

       Builds a PAR distribution from the blib/ subdirectory under "path", or
       under the current directory if unspecified.  If blib/ does not exist,
       it automatically runs Build, make, Build.PL or Makefile.PL to create
       it.

       Returns the filename of the generated PAR distribution.

       Valid parameters are:

       path
	 Sets the path which contains the blib/ subdirectory from which the
	 PAR distribution will be generated.

       name, version, suffix
	 These attributes set the name, version and platform specific suffix
	 of the distribution. Name and version can be automatically determined
	 from the distributions META.yml or Makefile.PL files.

	 The suffix is generated from your architecture name and your version
	 of perl by default.

       dist
	 The output filename for the PAR distribution.

       quiet
	 Set to true to suppress as much output as possible.

   install_par
       Installs a PAR distribution into the system, using
       "ExtUtils::Install::install_default".

       If only a single parameter is given, it is treated as the value for the
       "dist" parameter.

       Valid named parameters are:

       dist
	 The .par file to install. The heuristics outlined in the FUNCTIONS
	 section above apply.

       prefix
	 This string will be prepended to all installation paths.  If it isn't
	 specified, the environment variable "PERL_INSTALL_ROOT" is used as a
	 prefix.

       uninstall_shadows
	 This corresponds to the "uninstall_shadows" option of
	 ExtUtils::Install. Quoting its manual: If "uninstall_shadows" is set
	 to true, any differing versions throughout @INC will be uninstalled.
	 This is "make install UNINST=1".

       verbose
	 This corresponds to the "verbose" option of ExtUtils::Install.
	 According to its manual: If "verbose" is true, will print out each
	 file removed. This is "make install VERBINST=1".  "verbose" values
	 going up to 5 show increasingly more diagnostics output.

	 Default verbosity for PAR::Dist is 1.

       If you're just going to install into the running perl like everything
       else, you can stop reading the rest of this section now.

       Additionally, you can use several parameters to change the default
       installation destinations. You don't usually have to worry about this
       unless you are installing into a user-local directory.  The following
       section outlines the parameter names and default settings:

	 Parameter	   From 	 To
	 inst_lib	   blib/lib	 $Config{installsitelib} (*)
	 inst_archlib	   blib/arch	 $Config{installsitearch}
	 inst_script	   blib/script	 $Config{installscript}
	 inst_bin	   blib/bin	 $Config{installbin}
	 inst_man1dir	   blib/man1	 $Config{installman1dir}
	 inst_man3dir	   blib/man3	 $Config{installman3dir}
	 packlist_read			 $Config{sitearchexp}/auto/$name/.packlist
	 packlist_write 		 $Config{installsitearch}/auto/$name/.packlist

       The "packlist_write" parameter is used to control where the .packlist
       file is written to. (Necessary for uninstallation.)  The
       "packlist_read" parameter specifies a .packlist file to merge in if it
       exists. By setting any of the above installation targets to "undef",
       you can remove that target altogether. For example, passing
       "inst_man1dir =&gt undef, inst_man3dir =&gt undef" means that the contained
       manual pages won't be installed. This is not available for the
       packlists.

       Again, the defaults will be the normal site paths from %Config.

       (*) If the ".par"'s inst_archlib section (normally "blib/arch") isn't
       empty, the code in inst_lib (normally "blib/lib") is also installed
       into the inst_archlib path. This makes sense for XS modules.  If,
       however, you override "inst_lib", this automatic conversion is also
       overridden! You can use the named parameter "auto_inst_lib_conversion
       =&gt 1" to re-enable the conversion for custom inst_lib's.

       Finally, you may specify a "custom_targets" parameter. Its value should
       be a reference to a hash of custom installation targets such as

	 custom_targets =&gt { 'blib/my_data' =&gt '/some/path/my_data' }

       You can use this to install the .par archives contents to arbitrary
       locations.

   uninstall_par
       Uninstalls all previously installed contents of a PAR distribution,
       using "ExtUtils::Install::uninstall".

       Takes almost the same parameters as "install_par", but naturally, the
       installation target parameters do not apply. The only exception to this
       is the "packlist_read" parameter which specifies the .packlist file to
       read the list of installed files from.  It defaults to
       "$Config::Config{installsitearch}/auto/$name/.packlist".

       Additionally, the "uninstall_shadows" parameter of "install_par" isn't
       available.

   sign_par
       Digitally sign a PAR distribution using "gpg" or Crypt::OpenPGP, via
       Module::Signature.

   verify_par
       Verify the digital signature of a PAR distribution using "gpg" or
       Crypt::OpenPGP, via Module::Signature.

       Returns a boolean value indicating whether verification passed; $!  is
       set to the return code of "Module::Signature::verify".

   merge_par
       Note: Since version 0.32 of PAR::Dist, this function requires a YAML
       reader. The order of precedence is:

	 YAML YAML::Syck YAML::Tiny YAML::XS

       Merges two or more PAR distributions into one. First argument must be
       the name of the distribution you want to merge all others into.	Any
       following arguments will be interpreted as the file names of further
       PAR distributions to merge into the first one.

	 merge_par('foo.par', 'bar.par', 'baz.par')

       This will merge the distributions "foo.par", "bar.par" and "baz.par"
       into the distribution "foo.par". "foo.par" will be overwritten!

       The original META.yml of "foo.par" is retained, but augmented with any
       "provides", "requires", "recommends", "build_requires", and
       "configure_requires" sections from the other ".par" files.

   remove_man
       Remove the man pages from a PAR distribution. Takes one named
       parameter: dist which should be the name (and path) of the PAR
       distribution file. The calling conventions outlined in the "FUNCTIONS"
       section above apply.

       The PAR archive will be extracted, stripped of all "man\d?" and "html"
       subdirectories and then repackaged into the original file.

   get_meta
       Opens a PAR archive and extracts the contained META.yml file.  Returns
       the META.yml file as a string.

       Takes one named parameter: dist. If only one parameter is passed, it is
       treated as the dist parameter. (Have a look at the description in the
       "FUNCTIONS" section above.)

       Returns undef if no PAR archive or no META.yml within the archive were
       found.

   parse_dist_name
       First argument must be a distribution file name. The file name is
       parsed into distribution name, distribution version, architecture name,
       and perl version.

       Returns the results as a list in the above order.  If any or all of the
       above cannot be determined, returns undef instead of the undetermined
       elements.

       Supported formats are:

       Math-Symbolic-0.502-x86_64-linux-gnu-thread-multi-5.8.7

       Math-Symbolic-0.502

       The ".tar.gz" or ".par" extensions as well as any preceding paths are
       stripped before parsing. Starting with "PAR::Dist" 0.22, versions
       containing a preceding "v" are parsed correctly.

       This function is not exported by default.

   generate_blib_stub
       Creates a blib/lib subdirectory in the current directory and prepares a
       META.yml with meta information for a new PAR distribution. First
       argument should be the name of the PAR distribution in a format
       understood by "parse_dist_name()".  Alternatively, named arguments
       resembling those of "blib_to_par" are accepted.

       After running "generate_blib_stub" and injecting files into the blib
       directory, you can create a PAR distribution using "blib_to_par".  This
       function is useful for creating custom PAR distributions from scratch.
       (I.e. not from an unpacked CPAN distribution) Example:

	 use PAR::Dist;
	 use File::Copy 'copy';

	 generate_blib_stub(
	   name =&gt 'MyApp', version =&gt '1.00'
	 );
	 copy('MyApp.pm', 'blib/lib/MyApp.pm');
	 blib_to_par(); # generates the .par file!

       "generate_blib_stub" will not overwrite existing files.

   contains_binaries
       This function is not exported by default.

       Opens a PAR archive tries to determine whether that archive contains
       platform-specific binary code.

       Takes one named parameter: dist. If only one parameter is passed, it is
       treated as the dist parameter. (Have a look at the description in the
       "FUNCTIONS" section above.)

       Throws a fatal error if the PAR archive could not be found.

       Returns one if the PAR was found to contain binary code and zero
       otherwise.
