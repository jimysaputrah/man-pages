JSON::Syck(3)	      User Contributed Perl Documentation	 JSON::Syck(3)



NAME
       JSON::Syck - JSON is YAML (but consider using JSON::XS instead!)

SYNOPSIS
	   use JSON::Syck; # no exports by default

	   my $data = JSON::Syck::Load($json);
	   my $json = JSON::Syck::Dump($data);

	   # $file can be an IO object, or a filename
	   my $data = JSON::Syck::LoadFile($file);
	   JSON::Syck::DumpFile($file, $data);

DESCRIPTION
       JSON::Syck is a syck implementation of JSON parsing and generation.
       Because JSON is YAML
       (&lthttp://redhanded.hobix.com/inspect/yamlIsJson.html&gt), using syck
       gives you a fast and memory-efficient parser and dumper for JSON data
       representation.

       However, a newer module JSON::XS, has since emerged.  It is more
       flexible, efficient and robust, so please consider using it instead of
       this module.

DIFFERENCE WITH JSON
       You might want to know the difference between the JSON module and this
       one.

       Since JSON is a pure-perl module and JSON::Syck is based on libsyck,
       JSON::Syck is supposed to be very fast and memory efficient. See
       chansen's benchmark table at
       &lthttp://idisk.mac.com/christian.hansen/Public/perl/serialize.pl&gt

       JSON.pm comes with dozens of ways to do the same thing and lots of
       options, while JSON::Syck doesn't. There's only "Load" and "Dump".

       Oh, and JSON::Syck doesn't use camelCase method names :-)

REFERENCES
   SCALAR REFERENCE
       For now, when you pass a scalar reference to JSON::Syck, it
       dereferences to get the actual scalar value.

       JSON::Syck raises an exception when you pass in circular references.

       If you want to serialize self refernecing stuff, you should use YAML
       which supports it.

   SUBROUTINE REFERENCE
       When you pass subroutine reference, JSON::Syck dumps it as null.

UTF-8 FLAGS
       By default this module doesn't touch any of utf-8 flags set in strings,
       and assumes UTF-8 bytes to be passed and emit.

       However, when you set $JSON::Syck::ImplicitUnicode to 1, this module
       properly decodes UTF-8 binaries and sets UTF-8 flag everywhere, as in:

	 JSON (UTF-8 bytes)   =&gt Perl (UTF-8 flagged)
	 JSON (UTF-8 flagged) =&gt Perl (UTF-8 flagged)
	 Perl (UTF-8 bytes)   =&gt JSON (UTF-8 flagged)
	 Perl (UTF-8 flagged) =&gt JSON (UTF-8 flagged)

       Unfortunately, there's no implicit way to dump Perl UTF-8 flagged data
       structure to utf-8 encoded JSON. To do this, simply use Encode module,
       e.g.:

	 use Encode;
	 use JSON::Syck qw(Dump);

	 my $json = encode_utf8( Dump($data) );

       Alternatively you can use Encode::JavaScript::UCS to encode Unicode
       strings as in %uXXXX form.

	 use Encode;
	 use Encode::JavaScript::UCS;
	 use JSON::Syck qw(Dump);

	 my $json_unicode_escaped = encode( 'JavaScript-UCS', Dump($data) );

QUOTING
       According to the JSON specification, all JSON strings are to be double-
       quoted.	However, when embedding JavaScript in HTML attributes, it may
       be more convenient to use single quotes.

       Set $JSON::Syck::SingleQuote to 1 will make both "Dump" and "Load"
       expect single-quoted string literals.
