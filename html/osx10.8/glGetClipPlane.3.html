NAME
       glGetClipPlane  -  return  the  coefficients  of the specified clipping
       plane


C SPECIFICATION
       void glGetClipPlane( GLenum plane,
			    GLdouble *equation )


PARAMETERS
       plane	 Specifies a clipping plane.  The number  of  clipping	planes
		 depends  on  the  implementation,  but  at least six clipping
		 planes are supported.	They are identified by symbolic  names
		 of    the    form   GL_CLIP_PLANEi   where   0   &lt=	i    &lt
		 GL_MAX_CLIP_PLANES.

       equation  Returns four double-precision values  that  are  the  coeffi-
		 cients  of  the  plane  equation of plane in eye coordinates.
		 The initial value is (0, 0, 0, 0).

DESCRIPTION
       glGetClipPlane returns in equation the four coefficients of  the  plane
       equation for plane.

NOTES
       It is always the case that GL_CLIP_PLANEi = GL_CLIP_PLANE0 + i.

       If  an  error  is generated, no change is made to the contents of equa-
       tion.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if plane is not an accepted value.

       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if glGetClipPlane is executed between
       the execution of glBegin and the corresponding execution of glEnd.
