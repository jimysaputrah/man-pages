NAME
       hotspot.d - print disk event by location. Uses DTrace.

SYNOPSIS
       hotspot.d

DESCRIPTION
       hotspot.d  is  a  simple DTrace script to determine if disk activity is
       occuring in the one place - a "hotspot". This helps us  understand  the
       system's  usage	of a disk, it does not imply that the existance or not
       of a hotspot is good or bad (often may be good, less seeking).

       Since this uses DTrace, only users with root privileges	can  run  this
       command.

EXAMPLES
       Sample until Ctrl-C is hit then print report,
	      # hotspot.d


FIELDS
       Disk   disk instance name

       Major  driver major number

       Minor  driver minor number

       value  location of disk event, megabytes

       count  number of events


DOCUMENTATION
       See  the  DTraceToolkit for further documentation under the Docs direc-
       tory. The DTraceToolkit docs may include full worked examples with ver-
       bose descriptions explaining the output.

EXIT
       hotspot.d will sample until Ctrl-C is hit.
