DESCRIPTION
       cvlabel is used when configuring the Xsan File System disks.  One  host
       that  has  visibility to all the storage area network disk devices must
       create a list of disk labels, their associated device names and option-
       ally  the  sectors  to  use. The mount_acfs (1) process uses the volume
       labels to determine which disk drive is to be  used  for  Xsan  storage
       pool  nodes. The label name that is written to a disk device must match
       the [Disk ...] name in the File System Manager (FSM) configuration. See
       snfs_config(5) for details of the FSM configuration file.

       It  is  recommended to first use cvlabel with the -l or -L option. This
       option will present all of the usable disk devices found on the system.
       It  will try to identify the volume label and display the results. This
       will help determine what disk drives are visible to the client.

       The  next  step	is  to	create	the  label_list   file.    Use	 /Sys-
       tem/Library/Filesystems/acfs.fs/Contents/examples/cvlabels.example as a
       template for your file.	Or, use cvlabel with the -c option,  in  which
       case  cvlabel  will  write on stdout the list of all devices found in a
       format compatible with a label_list file.

       Once a label_list file has been generated it must be  edited  to  match
       the  desired  Xsan  label  updates. All LUNs included in the label_list
       file that are not allocated to the Xsan File System should  be  removed
       from  the label_list file to prevent accidental overwriting of existing
       data. Once all updates to the label_list are complete cvlabel should be
       run using this file to apply label changes to the indicated LUNs.

       A final option for creating a label file is to use the -C option with a
       format string.  This behaves the same as the -c option, except the for-
       mat  string is used to build template labels.  The format string uses a
       printf like syntax where % followed by a letter is replaced by informa-
       tion  obtained  from  the storage.  The available format strings are %B
       size in sectors, %L lun number, %C controller id and %S serial  number.
       Care  should  be taken to use a format which generates unique names for
       devices before using the output to label them.

       Certain RAID devices require special handling.  Cvlabel uses  the  raid
       strings	inquiry  table to determine which devices require special han-
       dling.  The default table (displayed with the -R option), can be  over-
       ridden  by  a  user supplied file $CVFSROOT/config/raid-strings.  Note:
       the -R option is not intended for general use and may be deprecated  in
       the future.  Only use when recommended by Apple Support.


USAGE
       Use the -l option (short format) or the -L option (long format) to list
       usable disk devices on the system.

       Use the -u &ltVolumeName&gt option to unlabel the specified volume.

       The -U &ltDeviceName&gt option is similar to the -u option, except that the
       path to the device special file is used instead of the label name.

       When  used  in conjunction with the -l option, the -s option prints the
       disk device serial #, which can be used to distinguish  the  difference
       between duplicate labels and multiple paths.

       When  used in conjunction with the -l or -L options, the -g option also
       prints GUID information for EFI-labeled disks.	The  GUID  includes  a
       timestamp and the MAC address of the node that created the label.

       When  used in conjunction with the -l or -L options, the -a option also
       prints unusable disk devices, along with a description of why they  are
       unusable. This is usually due to a lack of OS support for large LUNs or
       an unsupported disk label format.

       When used in conjunction with the   -c, -C, -l or -L options,  the   -F
       &ltfilter&gt  option  will  only list devices whose inquiry string contains
       the filter string.

       The -v option prints more information about the labeling process.  Mul-
       tiple  -v options accumulate, providing more information often used for
       debugging the label process.

       The -q option can be used during labeling to set the Command Tag  Queue
       Depth for Irix systems.	By default, the Depth is set to 16.

       The  -f	option forces labeling and you will not be asked for confirma-
       tion before labeling (or unlabeling) a disk device. WARNING: errors  in
       the Xsan label_list file can cause data loss.

       The  -c	option	outputs a cvlabel format template file to stdout. This
       template file will reflect all disk devices visible to the  local  sys-
       tem.   Use  this  template to build a cvlabel file. WARNING: Be sure to
       edit the template file to remove all devices  which  you  do  not  want
       labeled.

       The  -T option can be used in conjunction with the -c option to facili-
       tate conversion of labels from the old VTOC format to the new EFI  for-
       mat.  The output will be similar to the ordinary -c output, but devices
       that do not need conversion or cannot be safely converted will be  out-
       put  as	comment  lines, along with explanatory text.  Only convertible
       devices are output normally.

       The -D &ltVolumeName&gt option can be used to dump the label  for  &ltVolume-
       Name&gt  in ascii to stdout.  Examining this output is useful when debug-
       ging labels.

       The -r option can be used to force a disk  to  be  relabeled,  even  if
       there  are no changes to the label information. Normally such disks are
       skipped.

       The -R option can be used to display the default raid  strings  inquiry
       table.	Note  that  EFI  labels  are not supported on IRIX systems for
       older releases of the Xsan File System.

       The -i option controls the style of VTOC label written.	NOTE: The VTOC
       format previously generated by including the -I flag is now the default
       VTOC format. Thus, usage of the -I flag has been  deprecated.   The  -i
       option  can  be	used to write a legacy style CVFS VTOC label.  However
       the legacy VTOC format may become obsolete in a future release. The new
       default	VTOC  format  allows  for greater compatibility in modern Xsan
       releases. The legacy VTOC format will not  work	with  the  Solaris  10
       operating  system  and beyond. Unless the -i flag is specified, cvlabel
       will use the new format for VTOC labels.

       The -w option tells cvlabel to wait for the completion of the disk scan
       that  is  requested after a disk label has been written or a volume has
       been unlabeled.	The disk scan requests that  the  file	system	server
       update  its  internal  device tables and the -w option ensures that the
       operation has been completed.  Note that a disk scan may take a	number
       of  seconds on a large SAN or a SAN that is experiencing device errors.

	  *WARNING* Use this program with extreme caution! Modifying a	system
	  disk's  volume  label may result in irreparable harm to your system.
	  It may render the system inoperable and force you to repair the vol-
	  ume  using  the  boot  maintenance  program. Only label disk devices
	  which you are sure are to be used for the Xsan File System's storage
	  area network.


FILE FORMAT
       You   may  use  the  /System/Library/Filesystems/acfs.fs/Contents/exam-
       ples/cvlabels.example file as a template.

       A label entry consists of two or three parameters  on  a  single  line.
       White space and comment lines are allowed. Comment lines are designated
       by using a pound sign (#) as the first non-white space character of the
       line.

       The label_list file format is as follows:

	  &ltXsan_label_name&gt &ltoperating_system_device_name&gt [&ltsectors&gt [&lttype&gt]]

       Where:

       &ltXsan_label_name&gt

	  The &ltXsan_label_name&gt parameter is the name of the disk as described
	  in the FSM configuration file. The  parameter  must  match  a  [Disk
	  &ltXsan_label_name&gt] entry.

       &ltoperating_system_device_name&gt

	  The  &ltoperating_system_device_name&gt  is  the device name of the com-
	  plete disk device.

	  NOTE: operating system device names may  change  after  reboots  and
	  will differ per system. Always configure Xsan label files, and label
	  devices in the same session.

	  On Irix systems,  the  device  names	are  found  in	the  directory
	  /dev/rdsk and have the vol suffix.  An example would be fsd0vol.

	  On  Windows  systems, the devices start as PhysicalDrive0 and incre-
	  ment up to the number of drives configured.

       &ltsectors&gt

	  The &ltsectors&gt parameter is  the  number  in  512-byte  sectors  that
	  matches  the	[DiskType  ...] configuration in the FSM configuration
	  file. This is required for disks that  must  be  configured  smaller
	  than	their  actual  size.  For  example,  MPIRE video disks must be
	  under-configured to eliminate using the last zone of	the  disk.  If
	  &ltsectors&gt  is  not  specified or is specified as -, then the cvlabel
	  (1) program will use the entire available volume.

	  Some systems (and earlier releases of Xsan) can only use  the  first
	  2TB  of disks that are larger than 2TB.  To put a "short" VTOC label
	  on such a disk (truncating it to 2TB),  specify  short32  for  &ltsec-
	  tors&gt.

       &lttype&gt

	  The  &lttype&gt parameter is used to override the default label type, or
	  to change the label type for a disk that already has a  label.   The
	  value  can  be  either  VTOC or EFI. The default is EFI; VTOC can be
	  used for compatibility with older Xsan releases.


EXAMPLES
       List all the disk devices in a system.

	  rock # cvlabel -L
	  /dev/rdsk/dks0d1vol [SGI     IBM DDRS-34560W S96A] SGI_IRIX  Controller 'RDGX6289', Serial 'RDGX6289', Sector Size 512, Sectors Max 8883632 (4.2GB)
	  [...]
	  /dev/rdsk/20000004cf733161/lun0vol/c2p1 [SEAGATE ST336752FC	   0002] unknown  Controller 'Port A', Serial '20000004CF733161', Sector Size 512, Sectors Max 71675392 (34.2GB)

       Then create a template label file:

	  rock # cvlabel -c &gtlabel_list

       The output file will include an entry for the 'unknown' disk:

	  CvfsDisk_UNKNOWN /dev/rdsk/20000004cf733161/lun0vol/c2p1    # host 2 lun 0 sectors 71675392 sector_size 512 inquiry [SEAGATE ST336752FC      0002] serial 20000004CF733161

       Edit the label_list file,  changing  CvfsDisk_UNKNOWN  to  the  desired
       label name:

	  CvfsDisk_39 /dev/rdsk/20000004cf733161/lun0vol/c2p1

       Now  label  the disk devices. Your label_list file must be specified on
       the command line.

	  rock # cvlabel label_list

	  *WARNING* This program will over-write volume labels on the
		    devices specified in the file "label_list".

		    After execution, the devices will only be usable by the
		    Xsan File System. You will have to re-partition the
		    devices to use them on a different file system.


	  Do you want to proceed? (Y / N) -&gt y

	  /dev/rdsk/20000004cf733161/lun0vol/c2p1 [SEAGATE ST336752FC	   0002] unknown  Controller 'Port A', Serial '20000004CF733161', Sector Size 512, Sectors Max 71675392 (34.2GB)
	  Do you want to label it SNFS-VTOC - Name: CvfsDisk_39 Sectors: 71675392 (Y / N) -&gt y
	  New Volume Label -Device: /dev/rdsk/20000004cf733161/lun0vol/c2p1  SNFS Label: CvfsDisk_39  Sectors: 71675392.

	  Done.  1 source lines.  1 labels.

       The labels are done. List the disk devices again.


	  rock # cvlabel -L
	  /dev/rdsk/dks0d1vol [SGI     IBM DDRS-34560W S96A] SGI_IRIX  Controller 'RDGX6289', Serial 'RDGX6289', Sector Size 512, Sectors Max 8883632 (4.2GB)
	  [...]
	  /dev/rdsk/20000004cf733161/lun0vol/c2p1 [SEAGATE ST336752FC	   0002] SNFS-VTOC "CvfsDisk_39"  Controller 'Port A', Serial '20000004CF733161', Sector Size 512, Sectors 71675392 (34.2GB)

       Generate a label file of all LSI  storage  which  uses  the  controller
       serial number and lun numbers as components of the labels.


	  rock # cvlabel -C CVFS_%S_%L -F LSI &gt label_list

       Display to stdout the default raid strings inquiry table.

NOTES
       Due to conflicts between Solaris VTOC format and Irix VTOC  format  the
       partition  output  from	the  Irix fx(1M) utility may contain incorrect
       values. This will not affect Xsan.

       Some operating systems require a reboot after  a  disk  is  labeled  or
       relabeled.  It  is  recommended	that Xsan nodes are rebooted after new
       labels are written or existing labels are updated.
