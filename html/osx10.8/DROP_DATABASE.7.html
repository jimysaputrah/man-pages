NAME
       DROP_DATABASE - remove a database

SYNOPSIS
       DROP DATABASE [ IF EXISTS ] name

DESCRIPTION
       DROP DATABASE drops a database. It removes the catalog entries for the
       database and deletes the directory containing the data. It can only be
       executed by the database owner. Also, it cannot be executed while you
       or anyone else are connected to the target database. (Connect to
       postgres or any other database to issue this command.)


       DROP DATABASE cannot be undone. Use it with care!

PARAMETERS
       IF EXISTS
	   Do not throw an error if the database does not exist. A notice is
	   issued in this case.

       name
	   The name of the database to remove.

NOTES
       DROP DATABASE cannot be executed inside a transaction block.

       This command cannot be executed while connected to the target database.
       Thus, it might be more convenient to use the program dropdb(1) instead,
       which is a wrapper around this command.

COMPATIBILITY
       There is no DROP DATABASE statement in the SQL standard.
