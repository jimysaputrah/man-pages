NAME
       App::Prove::State::Result::Test - Individual test results.

VERSION
       Version 3.17

DESCRIPTION
       The "prove" command supports a "--state" option that instructs it to
       store persistent state across runs. This module encapsulates the
       results for a single test.

SYNOPSIS
	   # Re-run failed tests
	   $ prove --state=fail,save -rbv

METHODS
   Class Methods
       "new"

   Instance Methods
       "name"

       The name of the test.  Usually a filename.

       "elapsed"

       The total elapsed times the test took to run, in seconds from the
       epoch..

       "generation"

       The number for the "generation" of the test run.  The first generation
       is 1 (one) and subsequent generations are 2, 3, etc.

       "last_pass_time"

       The last time the test program passed, in seconds from the epoch.

       Returns "undef" if the program has never passed.

       "last_fail_time"

       The last time the test suite failed, in seconds from the epoch.

       Returns "undef" if the program has never failed.

       "mtime"

       Returns the mtime of the test, in seconds from the epoch.

       "raw"

       Returns a hashref of raw test data, suitable for serialization by YAML.

       "result"

       Currently, whether or not the test suite passed with no 'problems'
       (such as TODO passed).

       "run_time"

       The total time it took for the test to run, in seconds.	If
       "Time::HiRes" is available, it will have finer granularity.

       "num_todo"

       The number of tests with TODO directives.

       "sequence"

       The order in which this test was run for the given test suite result.

       "total_passes"

       The number of times the test has passed.

       "total_failures"

       The number of times the test has failed.

       "parser"

       The underlying parser object.  This is useful if you need the full
       information for the test program.
