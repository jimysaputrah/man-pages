PCAP_SETDIRECTION(3PCAP)			      PCAP_SETDIRECTION(3PCAP)



NAME
       pcap_setdirection  -  set  the direction for which packets will be cap-
       tured

SYNOPSIS
       #include &ltpcap/pcap.h&gt

       int pcap_setdirection(pcap_t *p, pcap_direction_t d);

DESCRIPTION
       pcap_setdirection() is used to specify a direction that packets will be
       captured.    d  is  one	of  the  constants  PCAP_D_IN,	PCAP_D_OUT  or
       PCAP_D_INOUT.  PCAP_D_IN will only  capture  packets  received  by  the
       device,	PCAP_D_OUT  will  only	capture packets sent by the device and
       PCAP_D_INOUT will capture packets received by or sent  by  the  device.
       PCAP_D_INOUT is the default setting if this function is not called.

       pcap_setdirection() isn't necessarily fully supported on all platforms;
       some platforms might return an error for all  values,  and  some  other
       platforms might not support PCAP_D_OUT.

       This operation is not supported if a ``savefile'' is being read.

RETURN VALUE
       pcap_setdirection()  returns  0 on success and -1 on failure.  If -1 is
       returned, pcap_geterr() or pcap_perror() may be called  with  p	as  an
       argument to fetch or display the error text.
