NAME
       glGetVertexAttribPointerv - return the address of the specified generic
       vertex attribute pointer

C SPECIFICATION
       void glGetVertexAttribPointerv(GLuint index, GLenum pname,
				      GLvoid **pointer);

PARAMETERS
       index
	   Specifies the generic vertex attribute parameter to be returned.

       pname
	   Specifies the symbolic name of the generic vertex attribute
	   parameter to be returned. Must be GL_VERTEX_ATTRIB_ARRAY_POINTER.

       pointer
	   Returns the pointer value.

DESCRIPTION
       glGetVertexAttribPointerv returns pointer information.  index is the
       generic vertex attribute to be queried, pname is a symbolic constant
       indicating the pointer to be returned, and params is a pointer to a
       location in which to place the returned data.

       The pointer returned is a byte offset into the data store of the buffer
       object that was bound to the GL_ARRAY_BUFFER target (see
       glBindBuffer()) when the desired pointer was previously specified.

NOTES
       The state returned is retrieved from the currently bound vertex array
       object.

       The initial value for each pointer is 0.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if no vertex array object is
       currently bound.

       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if index is greater than or equal to
       GL_MAX_VERTEX_ATTRIBS.

       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if pname is not an accepted value.

ASSOCIATED GETS
       glGet() with argument GL_MAX_VERTEX_ATTRIBS
