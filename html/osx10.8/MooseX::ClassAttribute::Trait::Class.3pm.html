NAME
       MooseX::ClassAttribute::Trait::Class - A trait for classes with class
       attributes

VERSION
       version 0.26

SYNOPSIS
	 for my $attr ( HasClassAttributes-&gtmeta()-&gtget_all_class_attributes() )
	 {
	     print $attr-&gtname();
	 }

DESCRIPTION
       This role adds awareness of class attributes to a metaclass object. It
       provides a set of introspection methods that largely parallel the
       existing attribute methods, except they operate on class attributes.

METHODS
       Every method provided by this role has an analogous method in
       "Class::MOP::Class" or "Moose::Meta::Class" for regular attributes.

   $meta-&gthas_class_attribute($name)
   $meta-&gtget_class_attribute($name)
   $meta-&gtget_class_attribute_list()
       These methods operate on the current metaclass only.

   $meta-&gtadd_class_attribute(...)
       This accepts the same options as the Moose::Meta::Attribute
       "add_attribute()" method. However, if an attribute is specified as
       "required" an error will be thrown.

   $meta-&gtremove_class_attribute($name)
       If the named class attribute exists, it is removed from the class,
       along with its accessor methods.

   $meta-&gtget_all_class_attributes()
       This method returns a list of attribute objects for the class and all
       its parent classes.

   $meta-&gtfind_class_attribute_by_name($name)
       This method looks at the class and all its parent classes for the named
       class attribute.

   $meta-&gtget_class_attribute_value($name)
   $meta-&gtset_class_attribute_value($name, $value)
   $meta-&gtset_class_attribute_value($name)
   $meta-&gtclear_class_attribute_value($name)
       These methods operate on the storage for class attribute values, which
       is attached to the metaclass object.

       There's really no good reason for you to call these methods unless
       you're doing some deep hacking. They are named as public methods solely
       because they are used by other meta roles and classes in this
       distribution.
