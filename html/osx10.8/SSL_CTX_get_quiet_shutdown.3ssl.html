SSL_CTX_set_quiet_shutdown(3)	    OpenSSL	 SSL_CTX_set_quiet_shutdown(3)



NAME
       SSL_CTX_set_quiet_shutdown, SSL_CTX_get_quiet_shutdown,
       SSL_set_quiet_shutdown, SSL_get_quiet_shutdown - manipulate shutdown
       behaviour

SYNOPSIS
	#include <openssl/ssl.h>

	void SSL_CTX_set_quiet_shutdown(SSL_CTX *ctx, int mode);
	int SSL_CTX_get_quiet_shutdown(const SSL_CTX *ctx);

	void SSL_set_quiet_shutdown(SSL *ssl, int mode);
	int SSL_get_quiet_shutdown(const SSL *ssl);

DESCRIPTION
       SSL_CTX_set_quiet_shutdown() sets the "quiet shutdown" flag for ctx to
       be mode. SSL objects created from ctx inherit the mode valid at the
       time SSL_new(3) is called. mode may be 0 or 1.

       SSL_CTX_get_quiet_shutdown() returns the "quiet shutdown" setting of
       ctx.

       SSL_set_quiet_shutdown() sets the "quiet shutdown" flag for ssl to be
       mode. The setting stays valid until ssl is removed with SSL_free(3) or
       SSL_set_quiet_shutdown() is called again.  It is not changed when
       SSL_clear(3) is called.	mode may be 0 or 1.

       SSL_get_quiet_shutdown() returns the "quiet shutdown" setting of ssl.

NOTES
       Normally when a SSL connection is finished, the parties must send out
       "close notify" alert messages using SSL_shutdown(3) for a clean
       shutdown.

       When setting the "quiet shutdown" flag to 1, SSL_shutdown(3) will set
       the internal flags to SSL_SENT_SHUTDOWN|SSL_RECEIVED_SHUTDOWN.
       (SSL_shutdown(3) then behaves like SSL_set_shutdown(3) called with
       SSL_SENT_SHUTDOWN|SSL_RECEIVED_SHUTDOWN.)  The session is thus
       considered to be shutdown, but no "close notify" alert is sent to the
       peer. This behaviour violates the TLS standard.

       The default is normal shutdown behaviour as described by the TLS
       standard.

RETURN VALUES
       SSL_CTX_set_quiet_shutdown() and SSL_set_quiet_shutdown() do not return
       diagnostic information.

       SSL_CTX_get_quiet_shutdown() and SSL_get_quiet_shutdown return the
       current setting.
