NAME
       Font::AFM - Interface to Adobe Font Metrics files

SYNOPSIS
	use Font::AFM;
	$h = new Font::AFM "Helvetica";
	$copyright = $h-&gtNotice;
	$w = $h-&gtWx-&gt{"aring"};
	$w = $h-&gtstringwidth("Gisle", 10);
	$h-&gtdump;  # for debugging

DESCRIPTION
       This module implements the Font::AFM class. Objects of this class are
       initialised from an AFM (Adobe Font Metrics) file and allow you to
       obtain information about the font and the metrics of the various glyphs
       in the font.

       All measurements in AFM files are given in terms of units equal to
       1/1000 of the scale factor of the font being used. To compute actual
       sizes in a document, these amounts should be multiplied by (scale
       factor of font)/1000.

       The following methods are available:

       $afm = Font::AFM-&gtnew($fontname)
	  Object constructor. Takes the name of the font as argument.  Croaks
	  if the font can not be found.

       $afm-&gtlatin1_wx_table()
	  Returns a 256-element array, where each element contains the width
	  of the corresponding character in the iso-8859-1 character set.

       $afm-&gtstringwidth($string, [$fontsize])
	  Returns the width of the argument string. The string is assumed to
	  be encoded in the iso-8859-1 character set.  A second argument can
	  be used to scale the width according to the font size.

       $afm-&gtFontName
	  The name of the font as presented to the PostScript language
	  "findfont" operator, for instance "Times-Roman".

       $afm-&gtFullName
	  Unique, human-readable name for an individual font, for instance
	  "Times Roman".

       $afm-&gtFamilyName
	  Human-readable name for a group of fonts that are stylistic variants
	  of a single design. All fonts that are members of such a group
	  should have exactly the same "FamilyName". Example of a family name
	  is "Times".

       $afm-&gtWeight
	  Human-readable name for the weight, or "boldness", attribute of a
	  font.  Examples are "Roman", "Bold", "Light".

       $afm-&gtItalicAngle
	  Angle in degrees counterclockwise from the vertical of the dominant
	  vertical strokes of the font.

       $afm-&gtIsFixedPitch
	  If "true", the font is a fixed-pitch (monospaced) font.

       $afm-&gtFontBBox
	  A string of four numbers giving the lower-left x, lower-left y,
	  upper-right x, and upper-right y of the font bounding box. The font
	  bounding box is the smallest rectangle enclosing the shape that
	  would result if all the characters of the font were placed with
	  their origins coincident, and then painted.

       $afm-&gtUnderlinePosition
	  Recommended distance from the baseline for positioning underline
	  strokes. This number is the y coordinate of the center of the
	  stroke.

       $afm-&gtUnderlineThickness
	  Recommended stroke width for underlining.

       $afm-&gtVersion
	  Version number of the font.

       $afm-&gtNotice
	  Trademark or copyright notice, if applicable.

       $afm-&gtComment
	  Comments found in the AFM file.

       $afm-&gtEncodingScheme
	  The name of the standard encoding scheme for the font. Most Adobe
	  fonts use the "AdobeStandardEncoding". Special fonts might state
	  "FontSpecific".

       $afm-&gtCapHeight
	  Usually the y-value of the top of the capital H.

       $afm-&gtXHeight
	  Typically the y-value of the top of the lowercase x.

       $afm-&gtAscender
	  Typically the y-value of the top of the lowercase d.

       $afm-&gtDescender
	  Typically the y-value of the bottom of the lowercase p.

       $afm-&gtWx
	  Returns a hash table that maps from glyph names to the width of that
	  glyph.

       $afm-&gtBBox
	  Returns a hash table that maps from glyph names to bounding box
	  information.	The bounding box consist of four numbers: llx, lly,
	  urx, ury.

       $afm-&gtdump
	  Dumps the content of the Font::AFM object to STDOUT.	Might
	  sometimes be useful for debugging.
