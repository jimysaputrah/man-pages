DateTime::TimeZone::FlUsernContributed Perl DocDateTime::TimeZone::Floating(3)



NAME
       DateTime::TimeZone::Floating - A time zone that is always local

VERSION
       version 1.41

SYNOPSIS
	 my $floating_tz = DateTime::TimeZone::Floating-&gtnew;

DESCRIPTION
       This class is used to provide the DateTime::TimeZone API needed by
       DateTime.pm, but for floating times, as defined by the RFC 2445 spec.
       A floating time has no time zone, and has an effective offset of zero.

USAGE
       This class has the same methods as a real time zone object, but the
       "short_name_for_datetime()", and "category()" methods both return
       undef.
