UMOUNT(8)		  BSD System Manager's Manual		     UMOUNT(8)

NAME
     umount -- unmount filesystems

SYNOPSIS
     umount [-fv] special | node
     umount -a | -A [-fv] [-h host] [-t type]

DESCRIPTION
     The umount command calls the unmount(2) system call to remove a special
     device or the remote node (rhost:path) from the filesystem tree at the
     point node.  If either special or node are not provided, the appropriate
     information is taken from the list of filesystems provided by
     getfsent(3).

     The options are as follows:

     -a      All the filesystems described via getfsent(3) are unmounted.

     -A      All the currently mounted filesystems except the root are
	     unmounted.

     -f      The filesystem is forcibly unmounted.  Active special devices
	     continue to work, but all other files return errors if further
	     accesses are attempted.  The root filesystem cannot be forcibly
	     unmounted.

     -h host
	     Only filesystems mounted from the specified host will be
	     unmounted.  This option implies the -A option and, unless other-
	     wise specified with the -t option, will only unmount NFS filesys-
	     tems.

     -t type
	     Is used to indicate the actions should only be taken on filesys-
	     tems of the specified type.  More than one type may be specified
	     in a comma separated list.  The list of filesystem types can be
	     prefixed with ``no'' to specify the filesystem types for which
	     action should not be taken.  For example, the umount command:

		   umount -a -t nfs,hfs

	     umounts all filesystems of the type NFS and HFS.

     -v      Verbose, additional information is printed out as each filesystem
	     is unmounted.

NOTES
     Due to the complex and interwoven nature of Mac OS X, umount may fail
     often.  It is recommended that diskutil(1) (as in, ``diskutil unmount
     /mnt'') be used instead.

HISTORY
     A umount command appeared in Version 6 AT&T UNIX.
