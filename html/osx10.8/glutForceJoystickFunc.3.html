NAME
       glutForceJoystickFunc - forces current window's joystick callback to be
       called.

SYNTAX
       #include &ltGLUT/glut.h&gt

       void glutForceJoystickFunc(void);

DESCRIPTION
       glutForceJoystickFunc forces the current window's joystick callback  to
       be called, reporting the latest joystick state.

       The  joystick  callback is called either due to polling of the joystick
       at the uniform timer interval set  by  glutJoystickFunc's  pollInterval
       (specified  in  milliseconds)  or  in response to calling glutForceJoy-
       stickFunc.  If the pollInterval is non-positive, no joystick polling is
       performed  and  the  GLUT  application must frequently (usually from an
       idle callback) call glutForceJoystickFunc.

       The joystick callback will be called once (if one exists) for each time
       glutForceJoystickFunc  is called.  The callback is called from glutJoy-
       stickFunc.  That is, when glutJoystickFunc returns, the	callback  will
       have already happened.

GLUT IMPLEMENTATION NOTES FOR X11
       The  GLUT 3.7 implementation of GLUT for X11 supports the joystick API,
       but not actual joystick input.  A future implementation of GLUT for X11
       may add joystick support.

GLUT IMPLEMENTATION NOTES FOR WIN32
       The GLUT 3.7 implementation of GLUT for Win32 supports the joystick API
       and joystick input, but does so through	the  dated  joySetCapture  and
       joyGetPosEx  Win32  Multimedia  API.  The GLUT 3.7 joystick support for
       Win32 has all the limitations of the Win32 Multimedia API joystick sup-
       port.  A future implementation of GLUT for Win32 may use DirectInput.
