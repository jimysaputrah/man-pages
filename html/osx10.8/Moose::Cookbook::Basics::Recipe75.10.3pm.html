NAME
       Moose::Cookbook::Basics::Recipe7 - Making Moose fast with immutable

SYNOPSIS
	 package Point;
	 use Moose;

	 has 'x' =&gt ( isa =&gt 'Int', is =&gt 'ro' );
	 has 'y' =&gt ( isa =&gt 'Int', is =&gt 'rw' );

	 __PACKAGE__-&gtmeta-&gtmake_immutable;

DESCRIPTION
       The Moose metaclass API provides a "make_immutable()" method. Calling
       this method does two things to your class. First, it makes it faster.
       In particular, object construction and destruction are effectively
       "inlined" in your class, and no longer invoke the meta API.

       Second, you can no longer make changes via the metaclass API, such as
       adding attributes. In practice, this won't be a problem, as you rarely
       need to do this after first loading the class.

CONCLUSION
       We strongly recommend you make your classes immutable. It makes your
       code much faster, with a small compile-time cost. This will be
       especially noticeable when creating many objects.
