NAME
       Net::DNS::RR::LOC - DNS LOC resource record

SYNOPSIS
       "use Net::DNS::RR";

DESCRIPTION
       Class for DNS Location (LOC) resource records.  See RFC 1876 for
       details.

METHODS
   version
	   print "version = ", $rr->version, "\n";

       Returns the version number of the representation; programs should
       always check this.  "Net::DNS" currently supports only version 0.

   size
	   print "size = ", $rr->size, "\n";

       Returns the diameter of a sphere enclosing the described entity, in
       centimeters.

   horiz_pre
	   print "horiz_pre = ", $rr->horiz_pre, "\n";

       Returns the horizontal precision of the data, in centimeters.

   vert_pre
	   print "vert_pre = ", $rr->vert_pre, "\n";

       Returns the vertical precision of the data, in centimeters.

   latitude
	   print "latitude = ", $rr->latitude, "\n";

       Returns the latitude of the center of the sphere described by the
       "size" method, in thousandths of a second of arc.  2**31 represents the
       equator; numbers above that are north latitude.

   longitude
	   print "longitude = ", $rr->longitude, "\n";

       Returns the longitude of the center of the sphere described by the
       "size" method, in thousandths of a second of arc.  2**31 represents the
       prime meridian; numbers above that are east longitude.

   latlon
	   ($lat, $lon) = $rr->latlon;
	   system("xearth", "-pos", "fixed $lat $lon");

       Returns the latitude and longitude as floating-point degrees.  Positive
       numbers represent north latitude or east longitude; negative numbers
       represent south latitude or west longitude.

   altitude
	   print "altitude = ", $rr->altitude, "\n";

       Returns the altitude of the center of the sphere described by the
       "size" method, in centimeters, from a base of 100,000m below the WGS 84
       reference spheroid used by GPS.
