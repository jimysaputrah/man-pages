NAME
       Moose::Manual::Classes - Making your classes use Moose (and
       subclassing)

VERSION
       version 2.0205

USING MOOSE
       Using Moose is very simple, you just "use Moose":

	 package Person;

	 use Moose;

       That's it, you've made a class with Moose!

       There's actually a lot going on here under the hood, so let's step
       through it.

       When you load Moose, a bunch of sugar functions are exported into your
       class, such as "extends", "has", "with", and more. These functions are
       what you use to define your class. For example, you might define an
       attribute ...

	 package Person;

	 use Moose;

	 has 'ssn' => ( is => 'rw' );

       Attributes are described in the Moose::Manual::Attributes
       documentation.

       Loading Moose also enables the "strict" and "warnings" pragmas in your
       class.

       When you load Moose, your class will become a subclass of
       Moose::Object. The Moose::Object class provides a default constructor
       and destructor, as well as object construction helper methods. You can
       read more about this in the Moose::Manual::Construction document.

       As a convenience, Moose creates a new class type for your class. See
       the Moose::Manual::Types document to learn more about types.

       It also creates a Moose::Meta::Class object for your class. This
       metaclass object is now available by calling a "meta" method on your
       class, for example "Person->meta".

       The metaclass object provides an introspection API for your class. It
       is also used by Moose itself under the hood to add attributes, define
       parent classes, and so on. In fact, all of Moose's sugar does the real
       work by calling methods on this metaclass object (and other meta API
       objects).

SUBCLASSING
       Moose provides a simple sugar function for declaring your parent
       classes, "extends":

	 package User;

	 use Moose;

	 extends 'Person';

	 has 'username' => ( is => 'rw' );

       Note that each call to "extends" will reset your parents. For multiple
       inheritance you must provide all the parents at once, "extends 'Foo',
       'Bar'".

       You can use Moose to extend a non-Moose parent. However, when you do
       this, you will inherit the parent class's constructor (assuming it is
       also called "new"). In that case, you will have to take care of
       initializing attributes manually, either in the parent's constructor,
       or in your subclass, and you will lose a lot of Moose magic.

       See the MooseX::NonMoose module on CPAN if you're interested in
       extending non-Moose parent classes with Moose child classes.

CLEANING UP MOOSE DROPPINGS
       Moose exports a number of functions into your class. It's a good idea
       to remove these sugar functions from your class's namespace, so that
       "Person->can('has')" will no longer return true.

       There are several ways to do this. We recommend using
       namespace::autoclean, a CPAN module. Not only will it remove Moose
       exports, it will also remove any other exports.

	 package Person;

	 use namespace::autoclean;

	 use Moose;

       If you absolutely can't use a CPAN module (but can use Moose?), you can
       write "no Moose" at the end of your class. This will remove any Moose
       exports in your class.

	 package Person;

	 use Moose;

	 has 'ssn' => ( is => 'rw' );

	 no Moose;

MAKING IT FASTER
       Moose has a feature called "immutabilization" that you can use to
       greatly speed up your classes at runtime. However, using it incurs a
       cost when your class is first being loaded. When you make your class
       immutable you tell Moose that you will not be changing it in the
       future. You will not be adding any more attributes, methods, roles,
       etc.

       This allows Moose to generate code specific to your class. In
       particular, it creates an "inline" constructor, making object
       construction much faster.

       To make your class immutable you simply call "make_immutable" on your
       class's metaclass object.

	 __PACKAGE__->meta->make_immutable;

   Immutabilization and "new()"
       If you override "new()" in your class, then the immutabilization code
       will not be able to provide an optimized constructor for your class.
       Instead, you should use a "BUILD()" method, which will be called from
       the inlined constructor.

       Alternately, if you really need to provide a different "new()", you can
       also provide your own immutabilization method. Doing so requires
       extending the Moose metaclasses, and is well beyond the scope of this
       manual.
