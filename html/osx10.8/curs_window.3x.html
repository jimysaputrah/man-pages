NAME
       newwin, delwin, mvwin, subwin, derwin, mvderwin, dupwin, wsyncup,
       syncok, wcursyncup, wsyncdown - create curses windows

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curses.h>

       WINDOW *newwin(int nlines, int ncols, int begin_y,
	     int begin_x);
       int delwin(WINDOW *win);
       int mvwin(WINDOW *win, int y, int x);
       WINDOW *subwin(WINDOW *orig, int nlines, int ncols,
	     int begin_y, int begin_x);
       WINDOW *derwin(WINDOW *orig, int nlines, int ncols,
	     int begin_y, int begin_x);
       int mvderwin(WINDOW *win, int par_y, int par_x);
       WINDOW *dupwin(WINDOW *win);
       void wsyncup(WINDOW *win);
       int syncok(WINDOW *win, bool bf);
       void wcursyncup(WINDOW *win);
       void wsyncdown(WINDOW *win);

DESCRIPTION
       Calling newwin creates and returns a pointer to a new window  with  the
       given  number  of lines and columns.  The upper left-hand corner of the
       window is at line begin_y, column begin_x.  If either nlines  or  ncols
       is  zero,  they	default  to LINES - begin_y and COLS - begin_x.  A new
       full-screen window is created by calling newwin(0,0,0,0).

       Calling delwin deletes the named window, freeing all memory  associated
       with  it  (it does not actually erase the window's screen image).  Sub-
       windows must be deleted before the main window can be deleted.

       Calling mvwin moves the window so that the upper left-hand corner is at
       position  (x,  y).   If	the  move would cause the window to be off the
       screen, it is an error and the window is not moved.  Moving  subwindows
       is allowed, but should be avoided.

       Calling	subwin	creates and returns a pointer to a new window with the
       given number of lines, nlines, and columns, ncols.  The	window	is  at
       position  (begin_y, begin_x) on the screen.  (This position is relative
       to the screen, and not to the window orig.)  The window is made in  the
       middle  of the window orig, so that changes made to one window will af-
       fect both windows.  The subwindow shares memory with the  window  orig.
       When  using this routine, it is necessary to call touchwin or touchline
       on orig before calling wrefresh on the subwindow.

       Calling derwin is the same as calling subwin, except that  begin_y  and
       begin_x	are  relative to the origin of the window orig rather than the
       screen.	There is no difference between the subwindows and the  derived
       windows.

       Calling	mvderwin moves a derived window (or subwindow) inside its par-
       ent window.  The screen-relative  parameters  of  the  window  are  not
       changed.  This routine is used to display different parts of the parent
       window at the same physical position on the screen.

       Calling dupwin creates an exact duplicate of the window win.

       Calling wsyncup touches all locations in  ancestors  of	win  that  are
       changed	in  win.   If  syncok is called with second argument TRUE then
       wsyncup is called automatically whenever there is a change in the  win-
       dow.

       The  wsyncdown  routine	touches  each  location  in  win that has been
       touched in any of its ancestor windows.	This routine is called by wre-
       fresh, so it should almost never be necessary to call it manually.

       The  routine  wcursyncup updates the current cursor position of all the
       ancestors of the window to reflect the current cursor position  of  the
       window.

RETURN VALUE
       Routines that return an integer return the integer ERR upon failure and
       OK (SVr4 only specifies "an integer value other than  ERR")  upon  suc-
       cessful completion.

       Routines that return pointers return NULL on error.

       X/Open defines no error conditions.  In this implementation

	      delwin
		   returns  an	error if the window pointer is null, or if the
		   window is the parent of another window.

		   This implementation also maintains a list of  windows,  and
		   checks  that  the  pointer  passed to delwin is one that it
		   created, returning an error if it was not..

	      mvderwin
		   returns an error if the window pointer is null, or if  some
		   part of the window would be placed off-screen.

	      mvwin
		   returns  an	error if the window pointer is null, or if the
		   window is really a pad, or if some part of the window would
		   be placed off-screen.

	      syncok
		   returns an error if the window pointer is null.

NOTES
       If  many small changes are made to the window, the wsyncup option could
       degrade performance.

       Note that syncok may be a macro.

BUGS
       The subwindow functions (subwin, derwin, mvderwin, wsyncup,  wsyncdown,
       wcursyncup,  syncok)  are flaky, incompletely implemented, and not well
       tested.

       The System V curses documentation is very unclear  about  what  wsyncup
       and  wsyncdown  actually do.  It seems to imply that they are only sup-
       posed to touch exactly  those  lines  that  are	affected  by  ancestor
       changes.  The language here, and the behavior of the curses implementa-
       tion, is patterned on the XPG4 curses standard.	The weaker  XPG4  spec
       may result in slower updates.

PORTABILITY
       The XSI Curses standard, Issue 4 describes these functions.
