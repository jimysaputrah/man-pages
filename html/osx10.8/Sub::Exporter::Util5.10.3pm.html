NAME
       Sub::Exporter::Util - utilities to make Sub::Exporter easier

VERSION
       version 0.982

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides a number of utility functions for performing
       common or useful operations when setting up a Sub::Exporter
       configuration.  All of the utilites may be exported, but none are by
       default.

THE UTILITIES
   curry_method
	 exports => {
	   some_method => curry_method,
	 }

       This utility returns a generator which will produce an invocant-curried
       version of a method.  In other words, it will export a method call with
       the exporting class built in as the invocant.

       A module importing the code some the above example might do this:

	 use Some::Module qw(some_method);

	 my $x = some_method;

       This would be equivalent to:

	 use Some::Module;

	 my $x = Some::Module->some_method;

       If Some::Module is subclassed and the subclass's import method is
       called to import "some_method", the subclass will be curried in as the
       invocant.

       If an argument is provided for "curry_method" it is used as the name of
       the curried method to export.  This means you could export a Widget
       constructor like this:

	 exports => { widget => curry_method('new') }

       This utility may also be called as "curry_class", for backwards
       compatibility.

   curry_chain
       "curry_chain" behaves like "curry_method", but is meant for generating
       exports that will call several methods in succession.

	 exports => {
	   reticulate => curry_chain([
	     new => gather_data => analyze => [ detail => 100 ] => results
	   ]),
	 }

       If imported from Spliner, calling the "reticulate" routine will be
       equivalent to:

	 Splinter->new->gather_data->analyze(detail => 100)->results;

       If any method returns something on which methods may not be called, the
       routine croaks.

       The arguments to "curry_chain" form an optlist.	The names are methods
       to be called and the arguments, if given, are arrayrefs to be
       dereferenced and passed as arguments to those methods.  "curry_chain"
       returns a generator like those expected by Sub::Exporter.

       Achtung! at present, there is no way to pass arguments from the
       generated routine to the method calls.  This will probably be solved in
       future revisions by allowing the opt list's values to be subroutines
       that will be called with the generated routine's stack.

   merge_col
	 exports => {
	   merge_col(defaults => {
	     twiddle => \'_twiddle_gen',
	     tweak   => \&_tweak_gen,
	   }),
	 }

       This utility wraps the given generator in one that will merge the named
       collection into its args before calling it.  This means that you can
       support a "default" collector in multipe exports without writing the
       code each time.

       You can specify as many pairs of collection names and generators as you
       like.

   mixin_installer
	 use Sub::Exporter -setup => {
	   installer => Sub::Exporter::Util::mixin_installer,
	   exports   => [ qw(foo bar baz) ],
	 };

       This utility returns an installer that will install into a superclass
       and adjust the ISA importing class to include the newly generated
       superclass.

       If the target of importing is an object, the hierarchy is reversed: the
       new class will be ISA the object's class, and the object will be
       reblessed.

       Prerequisites: This utility requires that Package::Generator be
       installed.

   like
       It's a collector that adds imports for anything like given regex.

       If you provide this configuration:

	 exports    => [ qw(igrep imap islurp exhausted) ],
	 collectors => { -like => Sub::Exporter::Util::like },

       A user may import from your module like this:

	 use Your::Iterator -like => qr/^i/; # imports igre, imap, islurp

       or

	 use Your::Iterator -like => [ qr/^i/ => { -prefix => 'your_' } ];

       The group-like prefix and suffix arguments are respected; other
       arguments are passed on to the generators for matching exports.
