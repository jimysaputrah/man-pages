NAME
       fileutil::magic::filetype  - Procedures implementing file-type recogni-
       tion

       package require fileutil::magic::filetype  ?1.0.2?

       ::fileutil::magic::filetype filename

_________________________________________________________________

DESCRIPTION
       This package provides a command for the recognition of  file  types  in
       pure Tcl.

       The  core  part	of the recognizer was generated from a "magic(5)" file
       containing the checks to perform to  recognize  files,  and  associated
       file-types.

       Beware!	This  recognizer is large, about 276 Kilobyte of generated Tcl
       code.

       ::fileutil::magic::filetype filename
	      This command is similar to the command fileutil::fileType.

	      The output of the command for the specified  file  is  a	string
	      describing the type of the file.

	      This  list  will	be empty if the type of the file is not recog-
	      nized.

       [1]    File(1) sources [ftp://ftp.astron.com/pub/file/] This site  con-
	      tains  the  current  sources for the file command, including the
	      magic definitions used by it. The latter were used by us to gen-
	      erate this recognizer.
