Dumpvalue(3pm)	       Perl Programmers Reference Guide 	Dumpvalue(3pm)



NAME
       Dumpvalue - provides screen dump of Perl data.

SYNOPSIS
	 use Dumpvalue;
	 my $dumper = Dumpvalue-&gtnew;
	 $dumper-&gtset(globPrint =&gt 1);
	 $dumper-&gtdumpValue(\*::);
	 $dumper-&gtdumpvars('main');
	 my $dump = $dumper-&gtstringify($some_value);

DESCRIPTION
   Creation
       A new dumper is created by a call

	 $d = Dumpvalue-&gtnew(option1 =&gt value1, option2 =&gt value2)

       Recognized options:

       "arrayDepth", "hashDepth"
	   Print only first N elements of arrays and hashes.  If false, prints
	   all the elements.

       "compactDump", "veryCompact"
	   Change style of array and hash dump.  If true, short array may be
	   printed on one line.

       "globPrint"
	   Whether to print contents of globs.

       "dumpDBFiles"
	   Dump arrays holding contents of debugged files.

       "dumpPackages"
	   Dump symbol tables of packages.

       "dumpReused"
	   Dump contents of "reused" addresses.

       "tick", "quoteHighBit", "printUndef"
	   Change style of string dump.  Default value of "tick" is "auto",
	   one can enable either double-quotish dump, or single-quotish by
	   setting it to """ or "'".  By default, characters with high bit set
	   are printed as is.  If "quoteHighBit" is set, they will be quoted.

       "usageOnly"
	   rudimentally per-package memory usage dump.	If set, "dumpvars"
	   calculates total size of strings in variables in the package.

       unctrl
	   Changes the style of printout of strings.  Possible values are
	   "unctrl" and "quote".

       subdump
	   Whether to try to find the subroutine name given the reference.

       bareStringify
	   Whether to write the non-overloaded form of the stringify-
	   overloaded objects.

       quoteHighBit
	   Whether to print chars with high bit set in binary or "as is".

       stopDbSignal
	   Whether to abort printing if debugger signal flag is raised.

       Later in the life of the object the methods may be queries with get()
       method and set() method (which accept multiple arguments).

   Methods
       dumpValue
	     $dumper-&gtdumpValue($value);
	     $dumper-&gtdumpValue([$value1, $value2]);

	   Prints a dump to the currently selected filehandle.

       dumpValues
	     $dumper-&gtdumpValues($value1, $value2);

	   Same as " $dumper-"dumpValue([$value1, $value2]); &gt.

       stringify
	     my $dump = $dumper-&gtstringify($value [,$noticks] );

	   Returns the dump of a single scalar without printing. If the second
	   argument is true, the return value does not contain enclosing
	   ticks.  Does not handle data structures.

       dumpvars
	     $dumper-&gtdumpvars('my_package');
	     $dumper-&gtdumpvars('my_package', 'foo', '~bar$', '!......');

	   The optional arguments are considered as literal strings unless
	   they start with "~" or "!", in which case they are interpreted as
	   regular expressions (possibly negated).

	   The second example prints entries with names "foo", and also
	   entries with names which ends on "bar", or are shorter than 5
	   chars.

       set_quote
	     $d-&gtset_quote('"');

	   Sets "tick" and "unctrl" options to suitable values for printout
	   with the given quote char.  Possible values are "auto", "'" and
	   """.

       set_unctrl
	     $d-&gtset_unctrl('unctrl');

	   Sets "unctrl" option with checking for an invalid argument.
	   Possible values are "unctrl" and "quote".

       compactDump
	     $d-&gtcompactDump(1);

	   Sets "compactDump" option.  If the value is 1, sets to a reasonable
	   big number.

       veryCompact
	     $d-&gtveryCompact(1);

	   Sets "compactDump" and "veryCompact" options simultaneously.

       set
	     $d-&gtset(option1 =&gt value1, option2 =&gt value2);

       get
	     @values = $d-&gtget('option1', 'option2');
