NAME
       glDeleteTextures - delete named textures

C SPECIFICATION
       void glDeleteTextures(GLsizei n, const GLuint * textures);

PARAMETERS
       n
	   Specifies the number of textures to be deleted.

       textures
	   Specifies an array of textures to be deleted.

DESCRIPTION
       glDeleteTextures deletes n textures named by the elements of the array
       textures. After a texture is deleted, it has no contents or
       dimensionality, and its name is free for reuse (for example by
       glGenTextures()). If a texture that is currently bound is deleted, the
       binding reverts to 0 (the default texture).


       glDeleteTextures silently ignores 0's and names that do not correspond
       to existing textures.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if n is negative.

ASSOCIATED GETS
       glIsTexture()
