NAME
       glScissor - define the scissor box


C SPECIFICATION
       void glScissor( GLint x,
		       GLint y,
		       GLsizei width,
		       GLsizei height )


PARAMETERS
       x, y Specify  the  lower left corner of the scissor box.  Initially (0,
	    0).

       width, height
	    Specify the width and height of the scissor box.  When a  GL  con-
	    text  is  first  attached to a window, width and height are set to
	    the dimensions of that window.

DESCRIPTION
       glScissor defines a rectangle, called the scissor box, in window  coor-
       dinates.  The first two arguments, x and y, specify the lower left cor-
       ner of the box.	width and height specify the width and height  of  the
       box.

       To  enable  and	disable  the scissor test, call glEnable and glDisable
       with argument GL_SCISSOR_TEST. The test is initially  disabled.	 While
       the test is enabled, only pixels that lie within the scissor box can be
       modified by drawing commands.  Window coordinates have  integer	values
       at  the	shared	corners  of  frame  buffer pixels.  glScissor(0,0,1,1)
       allows modification of only the lower left pixel  in  the  window,  and
       glScissor(0,0,0,0) doesn't allow modification of any pixels in the win-
       dow.

       When the scissor test is disabled, it is  as  though  the  scissor  box
       includes the entire window.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if either width or height is negative.

       GL_INVALID_OPERATION  is generated if glScissor is executed between the
       execution of glBegin and the corresponding execution of glEnd.

ASSOCIATED GETS
       glGet with argument GL_SCISSOR_BOX
       glIsEnabled with argument GL_SCISSOR_TEST
