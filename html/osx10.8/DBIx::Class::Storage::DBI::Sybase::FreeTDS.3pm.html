DBIx::Class::Storage::User:ContriDBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::Sybase::FreeTDS(3)



NAME
       DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::Sybase - Base class for drivers using
       DBD::Sybase over FreeTDS.

DESCRIPTION
       This is the base class for Storages designed to work with DBD::Sybase
       over FreeTDS.

       It is a subclass of DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::Sybase.

METHODS
   set_textsize
       When using DBD::Sybase with FreeTDS, "$dbh-&gt{LongReadLen}" is not
       available, use this function instead. It does:

	 $dbh-&gtdo("SET TEXTSIZE $bytes");

       Takes the number of bytes, or uses the "LongReadLen" value from your
       connect_info if omitted, lastly falls back to the 32768 which is the
       DBD::Sybase default.
