CREATE FOREIGN TABLE(7) PostgreSQL 9.1.4 Documentation CREATE FOREIGN TABLE(7)



NAME
       CREATE_FOREIGN_TABLE - define a new foreign table

SYNOPSIS
       CREATE FOREIGN TABLE [ IF NOT EXISTS ] table_name ( [
	 { column_name data_type [ NULL | NOT NULL ] }
	   [, ... ]
       ] )
	 SERVER server_name
       [ OPTIONS ( option 'value' [, ... ] ) ]

DESCRIPTION
       CREATE FOREIGN TABLE will create a new foreign table in the current
       database. The table will be owned by the user issuing the command.

       If a schema name is given (for example, CREATE FOREIGN TABLE
       myschema.mytable ...) then the table is created in the specified
       schema. Otherwise it is created in the current schema. The name of the
       foreign table must be distinct from the name of any other foreign
       table, table, sequence, index, or view in the same schema.


       CREATE FOREIGN TABLE also automatically creates a data type that
       represents the composite type corresponding to one row of the foreign
       table. Therefore, foreign tables cannot have the same name as any
       existing data type in the same schema.

PARAMETERS
       IF NOT EXISTS
	   Do not throw an error if a relation with the same name already
	   exists. A notice is issued in this case. Note that there is no
	   guarantee that the existing relation is anything like the one that
	   would have been created.

       table_name
	   The name (optionally schema-qualified) of the table to be created.

       column_name
	   The name of a column to be created in the new table.

       data_type
	   The data type of the column. This can include array specifiers. For
	   more information on the data types supported by PostgreSQL, refer
	   to Chapter 8, Data Types, in the documentation.

       NOT NULL
	   The column is not allowed to contain null values.

       NULL
	   The column is allowed to contain null values. This is the default.

	   This clause is only provided for compatibility with non-standard
	   SQL databases. Its use is discouraged in new applications.

       server_name
	   The name of an existing server for the foreign table.

       OPTIONS ( option 'value' [, ...] )
	   Options to be associated with the new foreign table. The allowed
	   option names and values are specific to each foreign data wrapper
	   and are validated using the foreign-data wrapper's validator
	   function. Option names must be unique.

EXAMPLES
       Create foreign table films with film_server:

	   CREATE FOREIGN TABLE films (
	       code	   char(5) NOT NULL,
	       title	   varchar(40) NOT NULL,
	       did	   integer NOT NULL,
	       date_prod   date,
	       kind	   varchar(10),
	       len	   interval hour to minute
	   )
	   SERVER film_server;

COMPATIBILITY
       The CREATE FOREIGN TABLE command largely conforms to the SQL standard;
       however, much as with CREATE TABLE, NULL constraints and zero-column
       foreign tables are permitted.

SEE ALSO
       ALTER FOREIGN TABLE (ALTER_FOREIGN_TABLE(7)), DROP FOREIGN TABLE
       (DROP_FOREIGN_TABLE(7)), CREATE TABLE (CREATE_TABLE(7)), CREATE SERVER
       (CREATE_SERVER(7))
