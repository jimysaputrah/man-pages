NAME
       Tk_FontId,  Tk_GetFontMetrics,  Tk_PostscriptFontName  - accessor func-
       tions for fonts

SYNOPSIS
       #include <tk.h>

       Font
       Tk_FontId(tkfont)

       Tk_GetFontMetrics(tkfont, fmPtr)

       int
       Tk_PostscriptFontName(tkfont, dsPtr)

ARGUMENTS
       Tk_Font tkfont (in)		   Opaque font	token  being  queried.
					   Must have been returned by a previ-
					   ous call to Tk_GetFont.

       Tk_FontMetrics *fmPtr (out)	   Pointer to structure in  which  the
					   font  metrics  for  tkfont  will be
					   stored. See DATA  STRUCTURES  below
					   for details.

       Tcl_DString *dsPtr (out) 	   Pointer     to    an    initialized
					   Tcl_DString to which  the  name  of
					   the	Postscript  font  that	corre-
					   sponds to tkfont will be  appended.

DESCRIPTION
       Given  a  tkfont,  Tk_FontId  returns the token that should be selected
       into an XGCValues structure in order to construct  a  graphics  context
       that can be used to draw text in the specified font.

       Tk_GetFontMetrics  computes  the  ascent, descent, and linespace of the
       tkfont in pixels and stores those values in the structure pointer to by
       fmPtr.	These values can be used in computations such as to space mul-
       tiple lines of text, to align the baselines of text in different fonts,
       and  to vertically align text in a given region.  See the documentation
       for the font command for definitions of the terms ascent, descent,  and
       linespace, used in font metrics.

       Tk_PostscriptFontName  maps  a  tkfont  to the corresponding Postscript
       font name that should be used when printing.  The return value  is  the
       size  in  points of the tkfont and the Postscript font name is appended
       to dsPtr.  DsPtr must refer to an  initialized  Tcl_DString.   Given  a
       "reasonable"  Postscript  printer,  the	following screen font families
       should print correctly:

	      Avant Garde, Arial, Bookman, Courier, Courier New, Geneva,  Hel-
	      vetica, Monaco, New Century Schoolbook, New York, Palatino, Sym-
	      bol, Times, Times New Roman, Zapf Chancery, and Zapf Dingbats.

       Any other font families may not print correctly	because  the  computed
       Postscript font name may be incorrect or not exist on the printer.

DATA STRUCTURES
       The  Tk_FontMetrics  data  structure  is  used  by Tk_GetFontMetrics to
       return information about a font and is defined as follows:
	      typedef struct Tk_FontMetrics {
		  int ascent;
		  int descent;
		  int linespace;
	      } Tk_FontMetrics;

       The ascent field is the amount in pixels that the tallest letter sticks
       up above the baseline, plus any extra blank space added by the designer
       of the font.

       The descent is the largest amount in  pixels  that  any	letter	sticks
       below the baseline, plus any extra blank space added by the designer of
       the font.

       The linespace is the sum of the ascent and descent.  How far apart  two
       lines  of  text	in  the same font should be placed so that none of the
       characters in one line overlap any of the characters in the other line.
