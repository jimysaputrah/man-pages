NAME
       LWP::ConnCache - Connection cache manager

NOTE
       This module is experimental.  Details of its interface is likely to
       change in the future.

SYNOPSIS
	use LWP::ConnCache;
	my $cache = LWP::ConnCache->new;
	$cache->deposit($type, $key, $sock);
	$sock = $cache->withdraw($type, $key);

DESCRIPTION
       The "LWP::ConnCache" class is the standard connection cache manager for
       LWP::UserAgent.

       The following basic methods are provided:

       $cache = LWP::ConnCache->new( %options )
	   This method constructs a new "LWP::ConnCache" object.  The only
	   option currently accepted is 'total_capacity'.  If specified it
	   initialize the total_capacity option.  It defaults to the value 1.

       $cache->total_capacity( [$num_connections] )
	   Get/sets the number of connection that will be cached.  Connections
	   will start to be dropped when this limit is reached.  If set to 0,
	   then all connections are immediately dropped.  If set to "undef",
	   then there is no limit.

       $cache->capacity($type, [$num_connections] )
	   Get/set a limit for the number of connections of the specified type
	   that can be cached.	The $type will typically be a short string
	   like "http" or "ftp".

       $cache->drop( [$checker, [$reason]] )
	   Drop connections by some criteria.  The $checker argument is a
	   subroutine that is called for each connection.  If the routine
	   returns a TRUE value then the connection is dropped.  The routine
	   is called with ($conn, $type, $key, $deposit_time) as arguments.

	   Shortcuts: If the $checker argument is absent (or "undef") all
	   cached connections are dropped.  If the $checker is a number then
	   all connections untouched that the given number of seconds or more
	   are dropped.  If $checker is a string then all connections of the
	   given type are dropped.

	   The $reason argument is passed on to the dropped() method.

       $cache->prune
	   Calling this method will drop all connections that are dead.  This
	   is tested by calling the ping() method on the connections.  If the
	   ping() method exists and returns a FALSE value, then the connection
	   is dropped.

       $cache->get_types
	   This returns all the 'type' fields used for the currently cached
	   connections.

       $cache->get_connections( [$type] )
	   This returns all connection objects of the specified type.  If no
	   type is specified then all connections are returned.  In scalar
	   context the number of cached connections of the specified type is
	   returned.

       The following methods are called by low-level protocol modules to try
       to save away connections and to get them back.

       $cache->deposit($type, $key, $conn)
	   This method adds a new connection to the cache.  As a result other
	   already cached connections might be dropped.  Multiple connections
	   with the same $type/$key might added.

       $conn = $cache->withdraw($type, $key)
	   This method tries to fetch back a connection that was previously
	   deposited.  If no cached connection with the specified $type/$key
	   is found, then "undef" is returned.	There is not guarantee that a
	   deposited connection can be withdrawn, as the cache manger is free
	   to drop connections at any time.

       The following methods are called internally.  Subclasses might want to
       override them.

       $conn->enforce_limits([$type])
	   This method is called with after a new connection is added
	   (deposited) in the cache or capacity limits are adjusted.  The
	   default implementation drops connections until the specified
	   capacity limits are not exceeded.

       $conn->dropping($conn_record, $reason)
	   This method is called when a connection is dropped.	The record
	   belonging to the dropped connection is passed as the first argument
	   and a string describing the reason for the drop is passed as the
	   second argument.  The default implementation makes some noise if
	   the $LWP::ConnCache::DEBUG variable is set and nothing more.

SUBCLASSING
       For specialized cache policy it makes sense to subclass
       "LWP::ConnCache" and perhaps override the deposit(), enforce_limits()
       and dropping() methods.

       The object itself is a hash.  Keys prefixed with "cc_" are reserved for
       the base class.
