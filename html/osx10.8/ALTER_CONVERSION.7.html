ALTER CONVERSION(7)	PostgreSQL 9.1.4 Documentation	   ALTER CONVERSION(7)



NAME
       ALTER_CONVERSION - change the definition of a conversion

SYNOPSIS
       ALTER CONVERSION name RENAME TO new_name
       ALTER CONVERSION name OWNER TO new_owner
       ALTER CONVERSION name SET SCHEMA new_schema

DESCRIPTION
       ALTER CONVERSION changes the definition of a conversion.

       You must own the conversion to use ALTER CONVERSION. To alter the
       owner, you must also be a direct or indirect member of the new owning
       role, and that role must have CREATE privilege on the conversion's
       schema. (These restrictions enforce that altering the owner doesn't do
       anything you couldn't do by dropping and recreating the conversion.
       However, a superuser can alter ownership of any conversion anyway.)

PARAMETERS
       name
	   The name (optionally schema-qualified) of an existing conversion.

       new_name
	   The new name of the conversion.

       new_owner
	   The new owner of the conversion.

       new_schema
	   The new schema for the conversion.

EXAMPLES
       To rename the conversion iso_8859_1_to_utf8 to latin1_to_unicode:

	   ALTER CONVERSION iso_8859_1_to_utf8 RENAME TO latin1_to_unicode;

       To change the owner of the conversion iso_8859_1_to_utf8 to joe:

	   ALTER CONVERSION iso_8859_1_to_utf8 OWNER TO joe;

COMPATIBILITY
       There is no ALTER CONVERSION statement in the SQL standard.

SEE ALSO
       CREATE CONVERSION (CREATE_CONVERSION(7)), DROP CONVERSION
