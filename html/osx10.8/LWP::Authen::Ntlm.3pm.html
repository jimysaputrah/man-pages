NAME
       LWP::Authen::Ntlm - Library for enabling NTLM authentication
       (Microsoft) in LWP

SYNOPSIS
	use LWP::UserAgent;
	use HTTP::Request::Common;
	my $url = 'http://www.company.com/protected_page.html';

	# Set up the ntlm client and then the base64 encoded ntlm handshake message
	my $ua = LWP::UserAgent-&gtnew(keep_alive=&gt1);
	$ua-&gtcredentials('www.company.com:80', '', "MyDomain\\MyUserCode", 'MyPassword');

	$request = GET $url;
	print "--Performing request now...-----------\n";
	$response = $ua-&gtrequest($request);
	print "--Done with request-------------------\n";

	if ($response-&gtis_success) {print "It worked!-&gt" . $response-&gtcode . "\n"}
	else {print "It didn't work!-&gt" . $response-&gtcode . "\n"}

DESCRIPTION
       "LWP::Authen::Ntlm" allows LWP to authenticate against servers that are
       using the NTLM authentication scheme popularized by Microsoft.  This
       type of authentication is common on intranets of Microsoft-centric
       organizations.

       The module takes advantage of the Authen::NTLM module by Mark Bush.
       Since there is also another Authen::NTLM module available from CPAN by
       Yee Man Chan with an entirely different interface, it is necessary to
       ensure that you have the correct NTLM module.

       In addition, there have been problems with incompatibilities between
       different versions of Mime::Base64, which Bush's Authen::NTLM makes use
       of.  Therefore, it is necessary to ensure that your Mime::Base64 module
       supports exporting of the encode_base64 and decode_base64 functions.

USAGE
       The module is used indirectly through LWP, rather than including it
       directly in your code.  The LWP system will invoke the NTLM
       authentication when it encounters the authentication scheme while
       attempting to retrieve a URL from a server.  In order for the NTLM
       authentication to work, you must have a few things set up in your code
       prior to attempting to retrieve the URL:

       o   Enable persistent HTTP connections

	   To do this, pass the "keep_alive=&gt1" option to the LWP::UserAgent
	   when creating it, like this:

	       my $ua = LWP::UserAgent-&gtnew(keep_alive=&gt1);

       o   Set the credentials on the UserAgent object

	   The credentials must be set like this:

	      $ua-&gtcredentials('www.company.com:80', '', "MyDomain\\MyUserCode", 'MyPassword');

	   Note that you cannot use the HTTP::Request object's
	   authorization_basic() method to set the credentials.  Note, too,
	   that the 'www.company.com:80' portion only sets credentials on the
	   specified port AND it is case-sensitive (this is due to the way LWP
	   is coded, and has nothing to do with LWP::Authen::Ntlm)

AVAILABILITY
       General queries regarding LWP should be made to the LWP Mailing List.
