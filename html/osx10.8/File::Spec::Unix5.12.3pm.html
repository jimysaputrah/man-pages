NAME
       File::Spec::Unix - File::Spec for Unix, base for other File::Spec
       modules

SYNOPSIS
	require File::Spec::Unix; # Done automatically by File::Spec

DESCRIPTION
       Methods for manipulating file specifications.  Other File::Spec
       modules, such as File::Spec::Mac, inherit from File::Spec::Unix and
       override specific methods.

METHODS
       canonpath()
	 No physical check on the filesystem, but a logical cleanup of a path.
	 On UNIX eliminates successive slashes and successive "/.".

	     $cpath = File::Spec->canonpath( $path ) ;

	 Note that this does *not* collapse x/../y sections into y.  This is
	 by design.  If /foo on your system is a symlink to /bar/baz, then
	 /foo/../quux is actually /bar/quux, not /quux as a naive ../-removal
	 would give you.  If you want to do this kind of processing, you
	 probably want "Cwd"'s "realpath()" function to actually traverse the
	 filesystem cleaning up paths like this.

       catdir()
	 Concatenate two or more directory names to form a complete path
	 ending with a directory. But remove the trailing slash from the
	 resulting string, because it doesn't look good, isn't necessary and
	 confuses OS2. Of course, if this is the root directory, don't cut off
	 the trailing slash :-)

       catfile
	 Concatenate one or more directory names and a filename to form a
	 complete path ending with a filename

       curdir
	 Returns a string representation of the current directory.  "." on
	 UNIX.

       devnull
	 Returns a string representation of the null device. "/dev/null" on
	 UNIX.

       rootdir
	 Returns a string representation of the root directory.  "/" on UNIX.

       tmpdir
	 Returns a string representation of the first writable directory from
	 the following list or the current directory if none from the list are
	 writable:

	     $ENV{TMPDIR}
	     /tmp

	 Since perl 5.8.0, if running under taint mode, and if $ENV{TMPDIR} is
	 tainted, it is not used.

       updir
	 Returns a string representation of the parent directory.  ".." on
	 UNIX.

       no_upwards
	 Given a list of file names, strip out those that refer to a parent
	 directory. (Does not strip symlinks, only '.', '..', and
	 equivalents.)

       case_tolerant
	 Returns a true or false value indicating, respectively, that
	 alphabetic is not or is significant when comparing file
	 specifications.

       file_name_is_absolute
	 Takes as argument a path and returns true if it is an absolute path.

	 This does not consult the local filesystem on Unix, Win32, OS/2 or
	 Mac OS (Classic).  It does consult the working environment for VMS
	 (see "file_name_is_absolute" in File::Spec::VMS).

       path
	 Takes no argument, returns the environment variable PATH as an array.

       join
	 join is the same as catfile.

       splitpath
	     ($volume,$directories,$file) = File::Spec->splitpath( $path );
	     ($volume,$directories,$file) = File::Spec->splitpath( $path, $no_file );

	 Splits a path into volume, directory, and filename portions. On
	 systems with no concept of volume, returns '' for volume.

	 For systems with no syntax differentiating filenames from
	 directories, assumes that the last file is a path unless $no_file is
	 true or a trailing separator or /. or /.. is present. On Unix this
	 means that $no_file true makes this return ( '', $path, '' ).

	 The directory portion may or may not be returned with a trailing '/'.

	 The results can be passed to "catpath()" to get back a path
	 equivalent to (usually identical to) the original path.

       splitdir
	 The opposite of "catdir()".

	     @dirs = File::Spec->splitdir( $directories );

	 $directories must be only the directory portion of the path on
	 systems that have the concept of a volume or that have path syntax
	 that differentiates files from directories.

	 Unlike just splitting the directories on the separator, empty
	 directory names ('') can be returned, because these are significant
	 on some OSs.

	 On Unix,

	     File::Spec->splitdir( "/a/b//c/" );

	 Yields:

	     ( '', 'a', 'b', '', 'c', '' )

       catpath()
	 Takes volume, directory and file portions and returns an entire path.
	 Under Unix, $volume is ignored, and directory and file are
	 concatenated.	A '/' is inserted if needed (though if the directory
	 portion doesn't start with '/' it is not added).  On other OSs,
	 $volume is significant.

       abs2rel
	 Takes a destination path and an optional base path returns a relative
	 path from the base path to the destination path:

	     $rel_path = File::Spec->abs2rel( $path ) ;
	     $rel_path = File::Spec->abs2rel( $path, $base ) ;

	 If $base is not present or '', then cwd() is used. If $base is
	 relative, then it is converted to absolute form using "rel2abs()".
	 This means that it is taken to be relative to cwd().

	 On systems that have a grammar that indicates filenames, this ignores
	 the $base filename. Otherwise all path components are assumed to be
	 directories.

	 If $path is relative, it is converted to absolute form using
	 "rel2abs()".  This means that it is taken to be relative to cwd().

	 No checks against the filesystem are made.  On VMS, there is
	 interaction with the working environment, as logicals and macros are
	 expanded.

	 Based on code written by Shigio Yamaguchi.

       rel2abs()
	 Converts a relative path to an absolute path.

	     $abs_path = File::Spec->rel2abs( $path ) ;
	     $abs_path = File::Spec->rel2abs( $path, $base ) ;

	 If $base is not present or '', then cwd() is used. If $base is
	 relative, then it is converted to absolute form using "rel2abs()".
	 This means that it is taken to be relative to cwd().

	 On systems that have a grammar that indicates filenames, this ignores
	 the $base filename. Otherwise all path components are assumed to be
	 directories.

	 If $path is absolute, it is cleaned up and returned using
	 "canonpath()".

	 No checks against the filesystem are made.  On VMS, there is
	 interaction with the working environment, as logicals and macros are
	 expanded.

	 Based on code written by Shigio Yamaguchi.
