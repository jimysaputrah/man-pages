DESCRIPTION
     Most XPC objects are boxed representations of primitive C language types
     or low-level operating system handles. These boxed objects are immutable.

     See xpc_object(3) for information about functions common to all XPC
     objects.

PRIMITIVE TYPES
     XPC objects can encapsulate a wide variety of primitive C language types:

   INTEGERS
     Boxed representations of 64-bit wide signed and unsigned integer types
     may be created with xpc_int64_create() and xpc_uint64_create() respec-
     tively. The boxed values may be retrieved using xpc_int64_get_value() and
     xpc_uint64_get_value().

   FLOATING POINT
     Boxed representations of double-precision floating point value represen-
     tations may be created with the xpc_double_create() function and
     retrieved with the xpc_double_get_value() function.

   DATES
     Boxed representations of date and time values, expressed as an integral
     number of nanoseconds before or after the Unix epoch, can be created with
     the xpc_date_create() function and retrieved with the
     xpc_date_get_value() function.  A date object representing the current
     date may be created with xpc_date_create_from_current() convenience func-
     tion.

   NULL AND BOOLEAN SINGLETONS
     Boxed representations of null and Boolean values are expressed as XPC
     object singletons. The xpc_bool_create() function returns one of two con-
     stant singleton Boolean values:
	   o   XPC_BOOL_TRUE
	   o   XPC_BOOL_FALSE

     The singleton values may be compared using direct pointer equality. Simi-
     larly, no type checking is required when retreiving these values from
     collections:

	   xpc_object_t xbool = xpc_dictionary_get_value(dictionary, "key");
	   if (xbool == XPC_BOOL_TRUE) {
		   // Handle the true case.
	   } else if (xbool == XPC_BOOL_FALSE)
		   // Handle the false case.
	   } else {
		   // Handle the case where there was a type mismatch or where there was no
		   // value for the key "key".
	   }

     The xpc_null_create() function returns a constant singleton representa-
     tion of a null value.  There is currently no defined constant for this
     singleton.

     It is safe to call xpc_retain(3) and xpc_release(3) on Boolean and null
     objects.

DATA, STRINGS AND UUIDS
   DATA
     Boxed representations of arbitrary byte values may be created with the
     xpc_data_create() function which takes a pointer to a buffer and length.
     A pointer to the underlying storage of the data object may be obtained
     using xpc_data_get_bytes_ptr().

     Important: This pointer is only valid for the lifetime of the data
     object. The underlying storage of the pointer value must not be modified
     by the caller. When ARC is enabled, care needs to be taken that the data
     object is not released prematurely, see xpc_object(3) for details.

     The contents of a data object may be copied to an external buffer using
     the xpc_data_get_bytes() function. This function takes a pointer to a
     buffer of size length to which the data will be copied.  The caller may
     also specify a non-zero offset into the source data at which to start the
     copy. The return value of this function is the number of bytes that were
     copied into the buffer.  If the destination buffer is smaller than the
     size of the source data, as many bytes as possible will be copied and the
     return value will be equal to the number of bytes specified in length.

     The underlying size of the data value may be determined using the
     xpc_data_get_length() function.

     When creating a data object, the contents of the provided buffer are
     copied into internal storage. If the caller wishes to avoid a copy, the
     buffer may first be encapsulated in a dispatch_data_t object and passed
     to xpc_data_create_with_dispatch_data().  See dispatch_data_create(3) for
     more information.

     Note: When the time comes to send a message, the XPC runtime will serial-
     ize the object graph, which will result in a copy of any data objects
     contained therein. If you are transporting large amounts of data and are
     performance-sensitive, you may wish to set up a shared memory region
     using mmap(2) and xpc_shmem_create() to minimize copying.

   STRINGS
     Boxed representations of C string values may be created using the
     xpc_string_create() function.  The XPC framework assumes all strings are
     encoded as UTF-8 and does not support any other encodings. A pointer to
     the C string representation of a value may be obtained using
     xpc_string_get_string_ptr().

     Important: This pointer is only valid for the lifetime of the string
     object. The underlying storage of the pointer value must not be modified
     by the caller.  When ARC is enabled, care needs to be taken that the
     string object is not released prematurely, see xpc_object(3) for details.

     The length of the C string value may be determined using the
     xpc_string_get_length() function. This length is does not include the NUL
     terminator character, similar to strlen(3).

     String objects may also be constructed from printf(3) -style format
     strings using the xpc_string_create_with_format() function.  Addition-
     ally, the xpc_string_create_with_format_and_arguments() function allows
     the caller to pass an existing va_list argument with which to construct
     the formatted string.

   UUIDs
     Boxed representations of UUID byte values may be created using
     xpc_uuid_create().  See uuid(3) for more information.  A pointer to stor-
     age for the underlying UUID value may be obtained using
     xpc_uuid_get_bytes().  The returned pointer may be safely passed to the
     relevant uuid(3) functions.

     Important: This pointer is only valid for the lifetime of the UUID
     object. The underlying storage of the UUID value must not be modified by
     the caller. When ARC is enabled, care needs to be taken that the UUID
     object is not released prematurely, see xpc_object(3) for details.

     The pattern of returning a pointer instead of copying the result into a
     uuid_t enables some convenient code simplification. For example:

	   if (uuid_compare(xpc_uuid_get_bytes(uuid_object), expected_uuid) == 0) {
		   // They are the same.
	   }

OUT-OF-LINE TYPES
     Boxed representations of low-level operating system primitives such as
     file descriptors and shared memory regions may be created and shared
     between processes as part of an XPC dictionary that is sent as a message.

   FILE DESCRIPTORS
     Boxed representations of file descriptors may be created using the
     xpc_fd_create() function.	Once created, there is no way to retrieve the
     original file descriptor from the boxed representation. Instead, the
     xpc_fd_dup() function can be used to create a new file descriptor in a
     similar manner to dup(2).	The caller is responsible for calling close(2)
     on the descriptor returned by this function.  Multiple calls to
     xpc_fd_dup() will produce multiple unique file descriptor values.	If a
     failure occurs (i.e. process file descriptor table is full), the invalid
     file descriptor value -1 will be returned.

   SHARED MEMORY
     Boxed representations of shared memory regions allocated using mmap(2)
     with the MAP_SHARED flag passed in the flags argument may be created
     using the xpc_shmem_create() function. Memory objects created using
     malloc(3) are not supported.  The region argument is a pointer to the
     beginning of the shared region and the length argument specifies the
     length of the shared region.

     The recipient of a shared memory object may map the underlying region
     into its address space using the xpc_shmem_map() function.  As with file
     descriptor objects, each call to this function returns a distinct but
     equivalent mapping. On output, the region argument will point to the
     address of the new mapping, and the return value will be the size of that
     mapping. The caller is responsible for unmapping the region with
     munmap(2).  If the mapping operation failed, 0 will be returned.

     New mappings will be created with the maximum permission as specified by
     the creator of the region. Currently, there is no direct way to modify
     the permissions that the recipient of a region will have. If the caller
     wishes to maintain read-write permissions to a region, for example, while
     giving others read-only access, it can create an equivalent mapping with
     the desired permissions using a combination of
     mach_make_memory_entry_64() and mach_vm_remap().  The details of this
     procedure are left as an exercise to the reader.
