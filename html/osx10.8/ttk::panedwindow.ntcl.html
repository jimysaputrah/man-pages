DESCRIPTION
       A  ttk::panedwindow  widget  displays  a  number of subwindows, stacked
       either vertically or horizontally.  The user may  adjust  the  relative
       sizes of the subwindows by dragging the sash between panes.

STANDARD OPTIONS
       -class		     -cursor		  -takefocus
       -style

       See the ttk_widget manual entry for details on the standard options.

WIDGET-SPECIFIC OPTIONS
       Command-Line Name:-orient
       Database Name:  orient
       Database Class: Orient

	      Specifies  the orientation of the window.  If vertical, subpanes
	      are stacked top-to-bottom; if horizontal, subpanes  are  stacked
	      left-to-right.

       Command-Line Name:-width
       Database Name:  width
       Database Class: Width

	      If present and greater than zero, specifies the desired width of
	      the widget in pixels.  Otherwise, the requested width is	deter-
	      mined by the width of the managed windows.

       Command-Line Name:-height
       Database Name:  height
       Database Class: Height

	      If  present  and greater than zero, specifies the desired height
	      of the widget in pixels.	Otherwise,  the  requested  height  is
	      determined by the height of the managed windows.

PANE OPTIONS
       The following options may be specified for each pane:

       Command-Line Name:-weight
       Database Name:  weight
       Database Class: Weight

	      An  integer  specifying the relative stretchability of the pane.
	      When the paned window is resized, the extra space  is  added  or
	      subtracted to each pane proportionally to its -weight.

WIDGET COMMAND
       Supports the standard configure, cget, state, and instate commands; see
       ttk::widget(n) for details.  Additional commands:

       pathname add subwindow options...
	      Adds a new pane to the window.  See PANE OPTIONS for the list of
	      available options.

       pathname forget pane
	      Removes  the  specified subpane from the widget.	pane is either
	      an integer index or the name of a managed subwindow.

       pathname identify component x y
	      Returns the name of the element under the point given by	x  and
	      y,  or the empty string if no component is present at that loca-
	      tion.  If component is omitted, it defaults to sash.   The  fol-
	      lowing subcommands are supported:

	      pathname identify element x y
		     Returns  the  name  of the element at the specified loca-
		     tion.

	      pathname identify sash x y
		     Returns the index of the sash at the specified  location.

       pathname insert pos subwindow options...
	      Inserts  a  pane	at  the specified position.  pos is either the
	      string end, an integer index, or the name of a  managed  subwin-
	      dow.  If subwindow is already managed by the paned window, moves
	      it to the specified position.  See PANE OPTIONS for the list  of
	      available options.

       pathname pane pane -option ?value ?-option value...
	      Query or modify the options of the specified pane, where pane is
	      either an integer index or the name of a managed subwindow.   If
	      no -option is specified, returns a dictionary of the pane option
	      values.  If one -option is specified, returns the value of  that
	      option.	Otherwise, sets the -options to the corresponding val-
	      ues.

       pathname panes
	      Returns the list of all windows managed by the widget.

       pathname sashpos index ?newpos?
	      If newpos is specified, sets the position of sash number	index.
	      May adjust the positions of adjacent sashes to ensure that posi-
	      tions are monotonically increasing.  Sash positions are  further
	      constrained  to  be  between 0 and the total size of the widget.
	      Returns the new position of sash number index.
