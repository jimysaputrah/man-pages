DESCRIPTION
       This  package  provides	a number of utility command for the conversion
       between the various representations of abstract syntax trees as	speci-
       fied in the document grammar::me_ast.

       ::grammar::me::util::ast2tree ast tree ?root?
	      This  command  converts  an ast from value to object representa-
	      tion. All nodes in the ast will be converted into nodes of  this
	      tree, with the root of the AST a child of the node root. If this
	      node is not explicitly specified the root of the tree  is  used.
	      Existing	content  of tree is not touched, i.e.  neither removed
	      nor changed, with the exception  of  the	specified  root  node,
	      which will gain a new child.

       ::grammar::me::util::ast2etree ast mcmd tree ?root?
	      This  command is like ::grammar::me::util::ast2tree, except that
	      the result is in the extended object representation of the input
	      AST.  The source of the extended information is the command pre-
	      fix mcmd.  It has to understand two methods, lc, and  tok,  with
	      the semantics specified below.

	      mcmd lc location
		     Takes  the  location  of  a  token given as offset in the
		     input stream and return a 2-element list  containing  the
		     associated line number and column index, in this order.

	      mcmd tok from ?to?
		     Takes  one  or two locations from and to as offset in the
		     input stream and returns a Tcl list containing the speci-
		     fied  part  of the input stream. Both location are inclu-
		     sive. If to is not specified it will default to the value
		     of from.

		     Each  element  of	the returned list is a list containing
		     the token, its associated lexeme, the  line  number,  and
		     column index, in this order.

       Both  the  ensemble  command ::grammar::me::tcl provided by the package
       grammar::me::tcl and the objects command created by the package ::gram-
       mar::me::cpu fit the above specification.

       ::grammar::me::util::tree2ast tree ?root?
	      This command converts an ast in (extended) object representation
	      into a value and returns it.  If a root node  is	specified  the
	      AST  is generated from that node downward. Otherwise the root of
	      the tree object is used as the starting point.
