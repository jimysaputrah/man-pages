NAME
       DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::AutoCast - Storage component for RDBMS
       requiring explicit placeholder typing

SYNOPSIS
	 $schema->storage->auto_cast(1);

DESCRIPTION
       In some combinations of RDBMS and DBD drivers (e.g. FreeTDS and Sybase)
       statements with values bound to columns or conditions that are not
       strings will throw implicit type conversion errors.

       As long as a column data_type is defined and resolves to a base RDBMS
       native type via "_native_data_type" as defined in your Storage driver,
       the placeholder for this column will be converted to:

	 CAST(? as $mapped_type)

       This option can also be enabled in connect_info as:

	 on_connect_call => ['set_auto_cast']

   connect_call_set_auto_cast
       Executes:

	 $schema->storage->auto_cast(1);

       on connection.

       Used as:

	   on_connect_call => ['set_auto_cast']

       in connect_info.
