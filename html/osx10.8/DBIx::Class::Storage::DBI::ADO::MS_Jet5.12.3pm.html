NAME
       DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::ADO::MS_Jet - Support for MS Access over ADO

DESCRIPTION
       This driver is a subclass of DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::ADO and
       DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::ACCESS for connecting to MS Access via
       DBD::ADO.

       See the documentation for DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::ACCESS for
       information on the MS Access driver for DBIx::Class.

       This driver implements workarounds for "TEXT/IMAGE/MEMO" columns, sets
       the cursor_class to DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::ADO::MS_Jet::Cursor to
       normalize returned "GUID" values and provides
       DBIx::Class::InflateColumn::DateTime support for "DATETIME" columns.

EXAMPLE DSNs
	 # older Access versions:
	 dbi:ADO:Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0;Data Source=C:\Users\rkitover\Documents\access_sample.accdb

	 # newer Access versions:
	 dbi:ADO:Provider=Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB.12.0;Data Source=C:\Users\rkitover\Documents\access_sample.accdb;Persist Security Info=False'

TEXT/IMAGE/MEMO COLUMNS
       The ADO driver does not suffer from the problems the ODBC driver has
       with these types of columns. You can use them safely.

       When you execute a "CREATE TABLE" statement over this driver with a
       "TEXT" column, it will be converted to "MEMO", while in the ODBC driver
       it is converted to "VARCHAR(255)".

       However, the caveat about LongReadLen having to be twice the max size
       of your largest "MEMO/TEXT" column +1 still applies. DBD::ADO sets
       LongReadLen to a large value by default, so it should be safe to just
       leave it unset. If you do pass a LongReadLen in your connect_info, it
       will be multiplied by two and 1 added, just as for the ODBC driver.
