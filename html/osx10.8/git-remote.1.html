DESCRIPTION
       Manage the set of repositories ("remotes") whose branches you track.

OPTIONS
       -v, --verbose
	   Be a little more verbose and show remote url after name. NOTE: This
	   must be placed between remote and subcommand.

COMMANDS
       With no arguments, shows a list of existing remotes. Several
       subcommands are available to perform operations on the remotes.

       add
	   Adds a remote named &ltname&gt for the repository at &lturl&gt. The command
	   git fetch &ltname&gt can then be used to create and update
	   remote-tracking branches &ltname&gt/&ltbranch&gt.

	   With -f option, git fetch &ltname&gt is run immediately after the
	   remote information is set up.

	   With --tags option, git fetch &ltname&gt imports every tag from the
	   remote repository.

	   With --no-tags option, git fetch &ltname&gt does not import tags from
	   the remote repository.

	   With -t &ltbranch&gt option, instead of the default glob refspec for
	   the remote to track all branches under the refs/remotes/&ltname&gt/
	   namespace, a refspec to track only &ltbranch&gt is created. You can
	   give more than one -t &ltbranch&gt to track multiple branches without
	   grabbing all branches.

	   With -m &ltmaster&gt option, a symbolic-ref refs/remotes/&ltname&gt/HEAD is
	   set up to point at remote's &ltmaster&gt branch. See also the set-head
	   command.

	   When a fetch mirror is created with --mirror=fetch, the refs will
	   not be stored in the refs/remotes/ namespace, but rather everything
	   in refs/ on the remote will be directly mirrored into refs/ in the
	   local repository. This option only makes sense in bare
	   repositories, because a fetch would overwrite any local commits.

	   When a push mirror is created with --mirror=push, then git push
	   will always behave as if --mirror was passed.

       rename
	   Rename the remote named &ltold&gt to &ltnew&gt. All remote-tracking
	   branches and configuration settings for the remote are updated.

	   In case &ltold&gt and &ltnew&gt are the same, and &ltold&gt is a file under
	   $GIT_DIR/remotes or $GIT_DIR/branches, the remote is converted to
	   the configuration file format.

       rm
	   Remove the remote named &ltname&gt. All remote-tracking branches and
	   configuration settings for the remote are removed.

       set-head
	   Sets or deletes the default branch (i.e. the target of the
	   symbolic-ref refs/remotes/&ltname&gt/HEAD) for the named remote. Having
	   a default branch for a remote is not required, but allows the name
	   of the remote to be specified in lieu of a specific branch. For
	   example, if the default branch for origin is set to master, then
	   origin may be specified wherever you would normally specify
	   origin/master.

	   With -d, the symbolic ref refs/remotes/&ltname&gt/HEAD is deleted.

	   With -a, the remote is queried to determine its HEAD, then the
	   symbolic-ref refs/remotes/&ltname&gt/HEAD is set to the same branch.
	   e.g., if the remote HEAD is pointed at next, "git remote set-head
	   origin -a" will set the symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD to
	   refs/remotes/origin/next. This will only work if
	   refs/remotes/origin/next already exists; if not it must be fetched
	   first.

	   Use &ltbranch&gt to set the symbolic-ref refs/remotes/&ltname&gt/HEAD
	   explicitly. e.g., "git remote set-head origin master" will set the
	   symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD to
	   refs/remotes/origin/master. This will only work if
	   refs/remotes/origin/master already exists; if not it must be
	   fetched first.

       set-branches
	   Changes the list of branches tracked by the named remote. This can
	   be used to track a subset of the available remote branches after
	   the initial setup for a remote.

	   The named branches will be interpreted as if specified with the -t
	   option on the git remote add command line.

	   With --add, instead of replacing the list of currently tracked
	   branches, adds to that list.

       set-url
	   Changes URL remote points to. Sets first URL remote points to
	   matching regex &ltoldurl&gt (first URL if no &ltoldurl&gt is given) to
	   &ltnewurl&gt. If &ltoldurl&gt doesn't match any URL, error occurs and
	   nothing is changed.

	   With --push, push URLs are manipulated instead of fetch URLs.

	   With --add, instead of changing some URL, new URL is added.

	   With --delete, instead of changing some URL, all URLs matching
	   regex &lturl&gt are deleted. Trying to delete all non-push URLs is an
	   error.

       show
	   Gives some information about the remote &ltname&gt.

	   With -n option, the remote heads are not queried first with git
	   ls-remote &ltname&gt; cached information is used instead.

       prune
	   Deletes all stale remote-tracking branches under &ltname&gt. These
	   stale branches have already been removed from the remote repository
	   referenced by &ltname&gt, but are still locally available in
	   "remotes/&ltname&gt".

	   With --dry-run option, report what branches will be pruned, but do
	   not actually prune them.

       update
	   Fetch updates for a named set of remotes in the repository as
	   defined by remotes.&ltgroup&gt. If a named group is not specified on
	   the command line, the configuration parameter remotes.default will
	   be used; if remotes.default is not defined, all remotes which do
	   not have the configuration parameter
	   remote.&ltname&gt.skipDefaultUpdate set to true will be updated. (See
	   git-config(1)).

	   With --prune option, prune all the remotes that are updated.

DISCUSSION
       The remote configuration is achieved using the remote.origin.url and
       remote.origin.fetch configuration variables. (See git-config(1)).

EXAMPLES
       o   Add a new remote, fetch, and check out a branch from it

	       $ git remote
	       origin
	       $ git branch -r
	       origin/master
	       $ git remote add linux-nfs git://linux-nfs.org/pub/linux/nfs-2.6.git
	       $ git remote
	       linux-nfs
	       origin
	       $ git fetch
	       * refs/remotes/linux-nfs/master: storing branch 'master' ...
		 commit: bf81b46
	       $ git branch -r
	       origin/master
	       linux-nfs/master
	       $ git checkout -b nfs linux-nfs/master
	       ...


       o   Imitate git clone but track only selected branches

	       $ mkdir project.git
	       $ cd project.git
	       $ git init
	       $ git remote add -f -t master -m master origin git://example.com/git.git/
	       $ git merge origin
