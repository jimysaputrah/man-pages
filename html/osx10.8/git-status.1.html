NAME
       git-status - Show the working tree status

SYNOPSIS
       git status [&ltoptions&gt...] [--] [&ltpathspec&gt...]


DESCRIPTION
       Displays paths that have differences between the index file and the
       current HEAD commit, paths that have differences between the working
       tree and the index file, and paths in the working tree that are not
       tracked by git (and are not ignored by gitignore(5)). The first are
       what you would commit by running git commit; the second and third are
       what you could commit by running git add before running git commit.

OPTIONS
       -s, --short
	   Give the output in the short-format.

       -b, --branch
	   Show the branch and tracking info even in short-format.

       --porcelain
	   Give the output in an easy-to-parse format for scripts. This is
	   similar to the short output, but will remain stable across git
	   versions and regardless of user configuration. See below for
	   details.

       -u[&ltmode&gt], --untracked-files[=&ltmode&gt]
	   Show untracked files.

	   The mode parameter is optional (defaults to all), and is used to
	   specify the handling of untracked files; when -u is not used, the
	   default is normal, i.e. show untracked files and directories.

	   The possible options are:

	   o	no - Show no untracked files

	   o	normal - Shows untracked files and directories

	   o	all - Also shows individual files in untracked directories.

	       The default can be changed using the status.showUntrackedFiles
	       configuration variable documented in git-config(1).

       --ignore-submodules[=&ltwhen&gt]
	   Ignore changes to submodules when looking for changes. &ltwhen&gt can
	   be either "none", "untracked", "dirty" or "all", which is the
	   default. Using "none" will consider the submodule modified when it
	   either contains untracked or modified files or its HEAD differs
	   from the commit recorded in the superproject and can be used to
	   override any settings of the ignore option in git-config(1) or
	   gitmodules(5). When "untracked" is used submodules are not
	   considered dirty when they only contain untracked content (but they
	   are still scanned for modified content). Using "dirty" ignores all
	   changes to the work tree of submodules, only changes to the commits
	   stored in the superproject are shown (this was the behavior before
	   1.7.0). Using "all" hides all changes to submodules (and suppresses
	   the output of submodule summaries when the config option
	   status.submodulesummary is set).

       --ignored
	   Show ignored files as well.

       -z
	   Terminate entries with NUL, instead of LF. This implies the
	   --porcelain output format if no other format is given.

       --column[=&ltoptions&gt], --no-column
	   Display untracked files in columns. See configuration variable
	   column.status for option syntax.--column and --no-column without
	   options are equivalent to always and never respectively.

OUTPUT
       The output from this command is designed to be used as a commit
       template comment, and all the output lines are prefixed with #. The
       default, long format, is designed to be human readable, verbose and
       descriptive. Its contents and format are subject to change at any time.

       The paths mentioned in the output, unlike many other git commands, are
       made relative to the current directory if you are working in a
       subdirectory (this is on purpose, to help cutting and pasting). See the
       status.relativePaths config option below.

   Short Format
       In the short-format, the status of each path is shown as

	   XY PATH1 -&gt PATH2

       where PATH1 is the path in the HEAD, and the " -&gt PATH2" part is shown
       only when PATH1 corresponds to a different path in the index/worktree
       (i.e. the file is renamed). The XY is a two-letter status code.

       The fields (including the -&gt) are separated from each other by a single
       space. If a filename contains whitespace or other nonprintable
       characters, that field will be quoted in the manner of a C string
       literal: surrounded by ASCII double quote (34) characters, and with
       interior special characters backslash-escaped.

       For paths with merge conflicts, X and Y show the modification states of
       each side of the merge. For paths that do not have merge conflicts, X
       shows the status of the index, and Y shows the status of the work tree.
       For untracked paths, XY are ??. Other status codes can be interpreted
       as follows:

       o   ' ' = unmodified

       o    M = modified

       o    A = added

       o    D = deleted

       o    R = renamed

       o    C = copied

       o    U = updated but unmerged

       Ignored files are not listed, unless --ignored option is in effect, in
       which case XY are !!.

	   X	      Y     Meaning
	   -------------------------------------------------
		     [MD]   not updated
	   M	    [ MD]   updated in index
	   A	    [ MD]   added to index
	   D	     [ M]   deleted from index
	   R	    [ MD]   renamed in index
	   C	    [ MD]   copied in index
	   [MARC]	    index and work tree matches
	   [ MARC]     M    work tree changed since index
	   [ MARC]     D    deleted in work tree
	   -------------------------------------------------
	   D	       D    unmerged, both deleted
	   A	       U    unmerged, added by us
	   U	       D    unmerged, deleted by them
	   U	       A    unmerged, added by them
	   D	       U    unmerged, deleted by us
	   A	       A    unmerged, both added
	   U	       U    unmerged, both modified
	   -------------------------------------------------
	   ?	       ?    untracked
	   !	       !    ignored
	   -------------------------------------------------

       If -b is used the short-format status is preceded by a line

       ## branchname tracking info

   Porcelain Format
       The porcelain format is similar to the short format, but is guaranteed
       not to change in a backwards-incompatible way between git versions or
       based on user configuration. This makes it ideal for parsing by
       scripts. The description of the short format above also describes the
       porcelain format, with a few exceptions:

	1. The user's color.status configuration is not respected; color will
	   always be off.

	2. The user's status.relativePaths configuration is not respected;
	   paths shown will always be relative to the repository root.

       There is also an alternate -z format recommended for machine parsing.
       In that format, the status field is the same, but some other things
       change. First, the -&gt is omitted from rename entries and the field
       order is reversed (e.g from -&gt to becomes to from). Second, a NUL
       (ASCII 0) follows each filename, replacing space as a field separator
       and the terminating newline (but a space still separates the status
       field from the first filename). Third, filenames containing special
       characters are not specially formatted; no quoting or
       backslash-escaping is performed.

CONFIGURATION
       The command honors color.status (or status.color -- they mean the same
       thing and the latter is kept for backward compatibility) and
       color.status.&ltslot&gt configuration variables to colorize its output.

       If the config variable status.relativePaths is set to false, then all
       paths shown are relative to the repository root, not to the current
       directory.

       If status.submodulesummary is set to a non zero number or true
       (identical to -1 or an unlimited number), the submodule summary will be
       enabled for the long format and a summary of commits for modified
       submodules will be shown (see --summary-limit option of git-
       submodule(1)).
