NAME
       Mail::Field - Base class for manipulation of mail header fields

INHERITANCE
	Mail::Field is extended by
	  Mail::Field::AddrList
	  Mail::Field::Date
	  Mail::Field::Generic

SYNOPSIS
	use Mail::Field;

	my $field = Mail::Field->new('Subject', 'some subject text');
	my $field = Mail::Field->new(Subject => 'some subject text');
	print $field->tag,": ",$field->stringify,"\n";

	my $field = Mail::Field->subject('some subject text');

DESCRIPTION
       "Mail::Field" creates and manipulates fields in MIME headers, collected
       within a Mail::Header object.  Different field types have their own
       sub-class (extension), defining additional useful accessors to the
       field content.

       People are invited to merge their implementation to special fields into
       MailTools, to maintain a consistent set of packages and documentation.

METHODS
   Constructors
       Mail::Field (and it's sub-classes) define several methods which return
       new objects. These can all be categorized as constructor.

       Mail::Field->combine(FIELDS)

	   Take a LIST of "Mail::Field" objects (which should all be of the
	   same sub-class) and create a new object in that same class.

       Mail::Field->extract(TAG, HEAD [, INDEX ])

	   Takes as arguments the tag name, a "Mail::Head" object and
	   optionally an index.

	   If the index argument is given then "extract" will retrieve the
	   given tag from the "Mail::Head" object and create a new
	   "Mail::Field" based object.	undef will be returned in the field
	   does not exist.

	   If the index argument is not given the the result depends on the
	   context in which "extract" is called. If called in a scalar context
	   the result will be as if "extract" was called with an index value
	   of zero. If called in an array context then all tags will be
	   retrieved and a list of "Mail::Field" objects will be returned.

       Mail::Field->new(TAG [, STRING | OPTIONS])

	   Create an object in the class which defines the field specified by
	   the TAG argument.

   "Fake" constructors
       $obj->create(OPTIONS)

	   This constructor is used internally with preprocessed field
	   information.  When called on an existing object, its original
	   content will get replaced.

       $obj->parse

	   Parse a field line.

   Accessors
       $obj->set(OPTIONS)

	   Change the settings (the content, but then smart) of this field.

       $obj->stringify

	   Returns the field as a string.

       $obj->tag

       Mail::Field->tag

	   Return the tag (in the correct case) for this item.	Well, actually
	   any casing is OK, because the field tags are treated case-
	   insentitive; however people have some preferences.

   Smart accessors
       $obj->text([STRING])

	   Without arguments, the field is returned as stringify() does.
	   Otherwise, the STRING is parsed with parse() to replace the
	   object's content.

	   It is more clear to call either stringify() or parse() directly,
	   because this method does not add additional processing.

DETAILS
   SUB-CLASS PACKAGE NAMES
       All sub-classes should be called Mail::Field::name where name is
       derived from the tag using these rules.

       o   Consider a tag as being made up of elements separated by '-'

       o   Convert all characters to lowercase except the first in each
	   element, which should be uppercase.

       o   name is then created from these elements by using the first N
	   characters from each element.

       o   N is calculated by using the formula :-

	       int((7 + #elements) / #elements)

       o   name is then limited to a maximum of 8 characters, keeping the
	   first 8 characters.

       For an example of this take a look at the definition of the
       "_header_pkg_name()" subroutine in "Mail::Field"

DIAGNOSTICS
       Error: Undefined subroutine <method> called

	   Mail::Field objects use autoloading to compile new functionality.
	   Apparently, the mehod called is not implemented for the specific
	   class of the field object.
