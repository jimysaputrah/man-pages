DESCRIPTION
       This trait provides native delegation methods for array references.

DEFAULT TYPE
       If you don't provide an "isa" value for your attribute, it will default
       to "ArrayRef".

PROVIDED METHODS
       o   count

	   Returns the number of elements in the array.

	     $stuff = Stuff->new;
	     $stuff->options( [ "foo", "bar", "baz", "boo" ] );

	     print $stuff->count_options; # prints 4

	   This method does not accept any arguments.

       o   is_empty

	   Returns a boolean value that is true when the array has no
	   elements.

	     $stuff->has_no_options ? die "No options!\n" : print "Good boy.\n";

	   This method does not accept any arguments.

       o   elements

	   Returns all of the elements of the array as an array (not an array
	   reference).

	     my @option = $stuff->all_options;
	     print "@options\n";    # prints "foo bar baz boo"

	   This method does not accept any arguments.

       o   get($index)

	   Returns an element of the array by its index. You can also use
	   negative index numbers, just as with Perl's core array handling.

	     my $option = $stuff->get_option(1);
	     print "$option\n";    # prints "bar"

	   If the specified element does not exist, this will return "undef".

	   This method accepts just one argument.

       o   pop

	   Just like Perl's builtin "pop".

	   This method does not accept any arguments.

       o   push($value1, $value2, value3 ...)

	   Just like Perl's builtin "push". Returns the number of elements in
	   the new array.

	   This method accepts any number of arguments.

       o   shift

	   Just like Perl's builtin "shift".

	   This method does not accept any arguments.

       o   unshift($value1, $value2, value3 ...)

	   Just like Perl's builtin "unshift". Returns the number of elements
	   in the new array.

	   This method accepts any number of arguments.

       o   splice($offset, $length, @values)

	   Just like Perl's builtin "splice". In scalar context, this returns
	   the last element removed, or "undef" if no elements were removed.
	   In list context, this returns all the elements removed from the
	   array.

	   This method requires at least one argument.

       o   first( sub { ... } )

	   This method returns the first matching item in the array, just like
	   List::Util's "first" function. The matching is done with a
	   subroutine reference you pass to this method. The subroutine will
	   be called against each element in the array until one matches or
	   all elements have been checked.

	     my $found = $stuff->find_option( sub {/^b/} );
	     print "$found\n";	  # prints "bar"

	   This method requires a single argument.

       o   first_index( sub { ... } )

	   This method returns the index of the first matching item in the
	   array, just like List::MoreUtils's "first_index" function. The
	   matching is done with a subroutine reference you pass to this
	   method. The subroutine will be called against each element in the
	   array until one matches or all elements have been checked.

	   This method requires a single argument.

       o   grep( sub { ... } )

	   This method returns every element matching a given criteria, just
	   like Perl's core "grep" function. This method requires a subroutine
	   which implements the matching logic.

	     my @found = $stuff->filter_options( sub {/^b/} );
	     print "@found\n";	  # prints "bar baz boo"

	   This method requires a single argument.

       o   map( sub { ... } )

	   This method transforms every element in the array and returns a new
	   array, just like Perl's core "map" function. This method requires a
	   subroutine which implements the transformation.

	     my @mod_options = $stuff->map_options( sub { $_ . "-tag" } );
	     print "@mod_options\n";	# prints "foo-tag bar-tag baz-tag boo-tag"

	   This method requires a single argument.

       o   reduce( sub { ... } )

	   This method turns an array into a single value, by passing a
	   function the value so far and the next value in the array, just
	   like List::Util's "reduce" function. The reducing is done with a
	   subroutine reference you pass to this method.

	     my $found = $stuff->reduce_options( sub { $_[0] . $_[1] } );
	     print "$found\n";	  # prints "foobarbazboo"

	   This method requires a single argument.

       o   sort

       o   sort( sub { ... } )

	   Returns the elements of the array in sorted order.

	   You can provide an optional subroutine reference to sort with (as
	   you can with Perl's core "sort" function). However, instead of
	   using $a and $b in this subroutine, you will need to use $_[0] and
	   $_[1].

	     # ascending ASCIIbetical
	     my @sorted = $stuff->sort_options();

	     # Descending alphabetical order
	     my @sorted_options = $stuff->sort_options( sub { lc $_[1] cmp lc $_[0] } );
	     print "@sorted_options\n";    # prints "foo boo baz bar"

	   This method accepts a single argument.

       o   sort_in_place

       o   sort_in_place( sub { ... } )

	   Sorts the array in place, modifying the value of the attribute.

	   You can provide an optional subroutine reference to sort with (as
	   you can with Perl's core "sort" function). However, instead of
	   using $a and $b, you will need to use $_[0] and $_[1] instead.

	   This method does not define a return value.

	   This method accepts a single argument.

       o   shuffle

	   Returns the elements of the array in random order, like "shuffle"
	   from List::Util.

	   This method does not accept any arguments.

       o   uniq

	   Returns the array with all duplicate elements removed, like "uniq"
	   from List::MoreUtils.

	   This method does not accept any arguments.

       o   join($str)

	   Joins every element of the array using the separator given as
	   argument, just like Perl's core "join" function.

	     my $joined = $stuff->join_options(':');
	     print "$joined\n";    # prints "foo:bar:baz:boo"

	   This method requires a single argument.

       o   set($index, $value)

	   Given an index and a value, sets the specified array element's
	   value.

	   This method returns the value at $index after the set.

	   This method requires two arguments.

       o   delete($index)

	   Removes the element at the given index from the array.

	   This method returns the deleted value. Note that if no value
	   exists, it will return "undef".

	   This method requires one argument.

       o   insert($index, $value)

	   Inserts a new element into the array at the given index.

	   This method returns the new value at $index.

	   This method requires two arguments.

       o   clear

	   Empties the entire array, like "@array = ()".

	   This method does not define a return value.

	   This method does not accept any arguments.

       o   accessor($index)

       o   accessor($index, $value)

	   This method provides a get/set accessor for the array, based on
	   array indexes.  If passed one argument, it returns the value at the
	   specified index.  If passed two arguments, it sets the value of the
	   specified index.

	   When called as a setter, this method returns the new value at
	   $index.

	   This method accepts one or two arguments.

       o   natatime($n)

       o   natatime($n, $code)

	   This method returns an iterator which, on each call, returns $n
	   more items from the array, in order, like "natatime" from
	   List::MoreUtils. A coderef can optionally be provided; it will be
	   called on each group of $n elements in the array.

	   This method accepts one or two arguments.

       o   shallow_clone

	   This method returns a shallow clone of the array reference.	The
	   return value is a reference to a new array with the same elements.
	   It is shallow because any elements that were references in the
	   original will be the same references in the clone.
