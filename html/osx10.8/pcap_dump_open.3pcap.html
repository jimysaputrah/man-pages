NAME
       pcap_dump_open, pcap_dump_fopen - open a file to which to write packets

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pcap/pcap.h>

       pcap_dumper_t *pcap_dump_open(pcap_t *p, const char *fname);
       pcap_dumper_t *pcap_dump_fopen(pcap_t *p, FILE *fp);

DESCRIPTION
       pcap_dump_open() is called to open a ``savefile'' for  writing.	 fname
       specifies  the  name  of  the file to open. The file will have the same
       format as those used by tcpdump(1) and tcpslice(1).  The name "-" in  a
       synonym for stdout.

       pcap_dump_fopen()  is  called  to write data to an existing open stream
       fp.  Note that on Windows, that stream should be opened in binary mode.

       p  is  a  capture or ``savefile'' handle returned by an earlier call to
       pcap_create() and activated by an earlier call to  pcap_activate(),  or
       returned  by  an earlier call to pcap_open_offline(), pcap_open_live(),
       or pcap_open_dead().  The link-layer type and snapshot  length  from  p
       are used as the link-layer type and snapshot length of the output file.

RETURN VALUES
       A pointer to a pcap_dumper_t structure to use in subsequent pcap_dump()
       and  pcap_dump_close()  calls is returned on success.  NULL is returned
       on failure.  If NULL is returned, pcap_geterr(p) can be used to get the
       error text.
