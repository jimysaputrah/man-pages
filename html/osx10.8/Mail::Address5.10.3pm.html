Mail::Address(3)      User Contributed Perl Documentation     Mail::Address(3)



NAME
       Mail::Address - Parse mail addresses

SYNOPSIS
	use Mail::Address;
	my @addrs = Mail::Address-&gtparse($line);

	foreach $addr (@addrs) {
	    print $addr-&gtformat,"\n";
	}

DESCRIPTION
       "Mail::Address" extracts and manipulates email addresses from a message
       header.	It cannot be used to extract addresses from some random text.
       You can use this module to create RFC822 compliant fields.

       Although "Mail::Address" is a very popular subject for books, and is
       used in many applications, it does a very poor job on the more complex
       message fields.	It does only handle simple address formats (which
       covers about 95% of what can be found). Problems are with

       o   no support for address groups, even not with the semi-colon as
	   separator between addresses;

       o   limitted support for escapes in phrases and comments.  There are
	   cases where it can get wrong; and

       o   you have to take care of most escaping when you create an address
	   yourself: "Mail::Address" does not do that for you.

       Often requests are made to the maintainers of this code improve this
       situation, but this is not a good idea, where it will break zillions of
       existing applications.  If you wish for a fully RFC2822 compliant
       implementation you may take a look at Mail::Message::Field::Full, part
       of MailBox.

       example:

	 my $s = Mail::Message::Field::Full-&gtparse($header);
	 # ref $s isa Mail::Message::Field::Addresses;

	 my @g = $s-&gtgroups;	      # all groups, at least one
	 # ref $g[0] isa Mail::Message::Field::AddrGroup;
	 my $ga = $g[0]-&gtaddresses;   # group addresses

	 my @a = $s-&gtaddresses;       # all addresses
	 # ref $a[0] isa Mail::Message::Field::Address;

METHODS
   Constructors
       Mail::Address-&gtnew(PHRASE, ADDRESS, [ COMMENT ])

	   Create a new "Mail::Address" object which represents an address
	   with the elements given. In a message these 3 elements would be
	   seen like:

	    PHRASE &ltADDRESS&gt (COMMENT)
	    ADDRESS (COMMENT)

	   example:

	    Mail::Address-&gtnew("Perl5 Porters", "perl5-porters@africa.nicoh.com");

       $obj-&gtparse(LINE)

	   Parse the given line a return a list of extracted "Mail::Address"
	   objects.  The line would normally be one taken from a To,Cc or Bcc
	   line in a message

	   example:

	    my @addr = Mail::Address-&gtparse($line);

   Accessors
       $obj-&gtaddress

	   Return the address part of the object.

       $obj-&gtcomment

	   Return the comment part of the object

       $obj-&gtformat([ADDRESSes])

	   Return a string representing the address in a suitable form to be
	   placed on a "To", "Cc", or "Bcc" line of a message.	This method is
	   called on the first ADDRESS to be used; other specified ADDRESSes
	   will be appended, separated with commas.

       $obj-&gtphrase

	   Return the phrase part of the object.

   Smart accessors
       $obj-&gthost

	   Return the address excluding the user id and '@'

       $obj-&gtname

	   Using the information contained within the object attempt to
	   identify what the person or groups name is.

       $obj-&gtuser

	   Return the address excluding the '@' and the mail domain
