NAME
       Archive::Tar::File - a subclass for in-memory extracted file from
       Archive::Tar

SYNOPSIS
	   my @items = $tar-&gtget_files;

	   print $_-&gtname, ' ', $_-&gtsize, "\n" for @items;

	   print $object-&gtget_content;
	   $object-&gtreplace_content('new content');

	   $object-&gtrename( 'new/full/path/to/file.c' );

DESCRIPTION
       Archive::Tar::Files provides a neat little object layer for in-memory
       extracted files. It's mostly used internally in Archive::Tar to tidy up
       the code, but there's no reason users shouldn't use this API as well.

   Accessors
       A lot of the methods in this package are accessors to the various
       fields in the tar header:

       name
	   The file's name

       mode
	   The file's mode

       uid The user id owning the file

       gid The group id owning the file

       size
	   File size in bytes

       mtime
	   Modification time. Adjusted to mac-time on MacOS if required

       chksum
	   Checksum field for the tar header

       type
	   File type -- numeric, but comparable to exported constants -- see
	   Archive::Tar's documentation

       linkname
	   If the file is a symlink, the file it's pointing to

       magic
	   Tar magic string -- not useful for most users

       version
	   Tar version string -- not useful for most users

       uname
	   The user name that owns the file

       gname
	   The group name that owns the file

       devmajor
	   Device major number in case of a special file

       devminor
	   Device minor number in case of a special file

       prefix
	   Any directory to prefix to the extraction path, if any

       raw Raw tar header -- not useful for most users

Methods
   Archive::Tar::File-&gtnew( file =&gt $path )
       Returns a new Archive::Tar::File object from an existing file.

       Returns undef on failure.

   Archive::Tar::File-&gtnew( data =&gt $path, $data, $opt )
       Returns a new Archive::Tar::File object from data.

       $path defines the file name (which need not exist), $data the file
       contents, and $opt is a reference to a hash of attributes which may be
       used to override the default attributes (fields in the tar header),
       which are described above in the Accessors section.

       Returns undef on failure.

   Archive::Tar::File-&gtnew( chunk =&gt $chunk )
       Returns a new Archive::Tar::File object from a raw 512-byte tar archive
       chunk.

       Returns undef on failure.

   $bool = $file-&gtextract( [ $alternative_name ] )
       Extract this object, optionally to an alternative name.

       See "Archive::Tar-&gtextract_file" for details.

       Returns true on success and false on failure.

   $path = $file-&gtfull_path
       Returns the full path from the tar header; this is basically a
       concatenation of the "prefix" and "name" fields.

   $bool = $file-&gtvalidate
       Done by Archive::Tar internally when reading the tar file: validate the
       header against the checksum to ensure integer tar file.

       Returns true on success, false on failure

   $bool = $file-&gthas_content
       Returns a boolean to indicate whether the current object has content.
       Some special files like directories and so on never will have any
       content. This method is mainly to make sure you don't get warnings for
       using uninitialized values when looking at an object's content.

   $content = $file-&gtget_content
       Returns the current content for the in-memory file

   $cref = $file-&gtget_content_by_ref
       Returns the current content for the in-memory file as a scalar
       reference. Normal users won't need this, but it will save memory if you
       are dealing with very large data files in your tar archive, since it
       will pass the contents by reference, rather than make a copy of it
       first.

   $bool = $file-&gtreplace_content( $content )
       Replace the current content of the file with the new content. This only
       affects the in-memory archive, not the on-disk version until you write
       it.

       Returns true on success, false on failure.

   $bool = $file-&gtrename( $new_name )
       Rename the current file to $new_name.

       Note that you must specify a Unix path for $new_name, since per tar
       standard, all files in the archive must be Unix paths.

       Returns true on success and false on failure.

Convenience methods
       To quickly check the type of a "Archive::Tar::File" object, you can use
       the following methods:

       $file-&gtis_file
	   Returns true if the file is of type "file"

       $file-&gtis_dir
	   Returns true if the file is of type "dir"

       $file-&gtis_hardlink
	   Returns true if the file is of type "hardlink"

       $file-&gtis_symlink
	   Returns true if the file is of type "symlink"

       $file-&gtis_chardev
	   Returns true if the file is of type "chardev"

       $file-&gtis_blockdev
	   Returns true if the file is of type "blockdev"

       $file-&gtis_fifo
	   Returns true if the file is of type "fifo"

       $file-&gtis_socket
	   Returns true if the file is of type "socket"

       $file-&gtis_longlink
	   Returns true if the file is of type "LongLink".  Should not happen
	   after a successful "read".

       $file-&gtis_label
	   Returns true if the file is of type "Label".  Should not happen
	   after a successful "read".

       $file-&gtis_unknown
	   Returns true if the file type is "unknown"
