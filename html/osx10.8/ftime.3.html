FTIME(3)		 BSD Library Functions Manual		      FTIME(3)

NAME
     ftime -- get date and time

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/timeb.h>

     int
     ftime(struct timeb *tp);

DESCRIPTION
     This interface is obsoleted by gettimeofday(2).

     The ftime() routine fills in a structure pointed to by its argument, as
     defined by <sys/timeb.h>:

	   /*
	    * Structure returned by ftime system call
	    */
	   struct timeb
	   {
		     time_t  time;
		     unsigned short millitm;
		     short   timezone;
		     short   dstflag;
	   };

     The structure contains the time since the epoch, in seconds; up to 1000
     milliseconds of more-precise interval; the local time zone (measured in
     minutes of time westward from Greenwich); and a flag that, if nonzero,
     indicates that Daylight Saving time applies locally during the appropri-
     ate part of the year.

LEGACY SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/types.h>
     #include <sys/timeb.h>

     The include file <sys/types.h> is necessary.

SEE ALSO
     gettimeofday(2), settimeofday(2), ctime(3), time(3), compat(5)
