NAME
       File::Spec::VMS - methods for VMS file specs

SYNOPSIS
	require File::Spec::VMS; # Done internally by File::Spec if needed

DESCRIPTION
       See File::Spec::Unix for a documentation of the methods provided there.
       This package overrides the implementation of these methods, not the
       semantics.

       The mode of operation of these routines depend on the VMS features that
       are controlled by the DECC features "DECC$FILENAME_REPORT_UNIX" and
       "DECC$EFS_CHARSET".

       Perl needs to be at least at 5.10 for these feature settings to work.
       Use of them on older perl versions on VMS will result in unpredictable
       operations.

       The default and traditional mode of these routines have been to expect
       VMS syntax on input and to return VMS syntax on output, even when Unix
       syntax was given on input.

       The default and traditional mode is also incompatible with the VMS
       "EFS", Extended File system character set, and with running Perl
       scripts under &ltGNV&gt, Gnu is not VMS, an optional Unix like runtime
       environment on VMS.

       If the "DECC$EFS_CHARSET" feature is enabled, These routines will now
       accept either VMS or UNIX syntax.  If the input parameters are clearly
       VMS syntax, the return value will be in VMS syntax.  If the input
       parameters are clearly in Unix syntax, the output will be in Unix
       syntax.

       This corresponds to the way that the VMS C library routines have always
       handled filenames, and what a programmer who has not specifically read
       this pod before would also expect.

       If the "DECC$FILENAME_REPORT_UNIX" feature is enabled, then if the
       output syntax can not be determined from the input syntax, the output
       syntax will be UNIX.  If the feature is not enabled, VMS output will be
       the default.

       canonpath (override)
	   Removes redundant portions of file specifications according to the
	   syntax detected.

       catdir (override)
	   Concatenates a list of file specifications, and returns the result
	   as a directory specification.  No check is made for "impossible"
	   cases (e.g. elements other than the first being absolute
	   filespecs).

       catfile (override)
	   Concatenates a list of directory specifications with a filename
	   specification to build a path.

       curdir (override)
	   Returns a string representation of the current directory: '[]' or
	   '.'

       devnull (override)
	   Returns a string representation of the null device: '_NLA0:' or
	   '/dev/null'

       rootdir (override)
	   Returns a string representation of the root directory:
	   'SYS$DISK:[000000]' or '/'

       tmpdir (override)
	   Returns a string representation of the first writable directory
	   from the following list or '' if none are writable:

	       /tmp if C&ltDECC$FILENAME_REPORT_UNIX&gt is enabled.
	       sys$scratch:
	       $ENV{TMPDIR}

	   Since perl 5.8.0, if running under taint mode, and if $ENV{TMPDIR}
	   is tainted, it is not used.

       updir (override)
	   Returns a string representation of the parent directory: '[-]' or
	   '..'

       case_tolerant (override)
	   VMS file specification syntax is case-tolerant.

       path (override)
	   Translate logical name DCL$PATH as a searchlist, rather than trying
	   to "split" string value of $ENV{'PATH'}.

       file_name_is_absolute (override)
	   Checks for VMS directory spec as well as Unix separators.

       splitpath (override)
	       ($volume,$directories,$file) = File::Spec-&gtsplitpath( $path );
	       ($volume,$directories,$file) = File::Spec-&gtsplitpath( $path, $no_file );

	   Passing a true value for $no_file indicates that the path being
	   split only contains directory components, even on systems where you
	   can usually (when not supporting a foreign syntax) tell the
	   difference between directories and files at a glance.

       splitdir (override)
	   Split a directory specification into the components.

       catpath (override)
	   Construct a complete filespec.

       abs2rel (override)
	   Attempt to convert a file specification to a relative
	   specification.  On a system with volumes, like VMS, this may not be
	   possible.

       rel2abs (override)
	   Return an absolute file specification from a relative one.
