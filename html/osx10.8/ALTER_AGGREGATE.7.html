ALTER AGGREGATE(7)	PostgreSQL 9.1.4 Documentation	    ALTER AGGREGATE(7)



NAME
       ALTER_AGGREGATE - change the definition of an aggregate function

SYNOPSIS
       ALTER AGGREGATE name ( type [ , ... ] ) RENAME TO new_name
       ALTER AGGREGATE name ( type [ , ... ] ) OWNER TO new_owner
       ALTER AGGREGATE name ( type [ , ... ] ) SET SCHEMA new_schema

DESCRIPTION
       ALTER AGGREGATE changes the definition of an aggregate function.

       You must own the aggregate function to use ALTER AGGREGATE. To change
       the schema of an aggregate function, you must also have CREATE
       privilege on the new schema. To alter the owner, you must also be a
       direct or indirect member of the new owning role, and that role must
       have CREATE privilege on the aggregate function's schema. (These
       restrictions enforce that altering the owner doesn't do anything you
       couldn't do by dropping and recreating the aggregate function. However,
       a superuser can alter ownership of any aggregate function anyway.)

PARAMETERS
       name
	   The name (optionally schema-qualified) of an existing aggregate
	   function.

       type
	   An input data type on which the aggregate function operates. To
	   reference a zero-argument aggregate function, write * in place of
	   the list of input data types.

       new_name
	   The new name of the aggregate function.

       new_owner
	   The new owner of the aggregate function.

       new_schema
	   The new schema for the aggregate function.

EXAMPLES
       To rename the aggregate function myavg for type integer to my_average:

	   ALTER AGGREGATE myavg(integer) RENAME TO my_average;

       To change the owner of the aggregate function myavg for type integer to
       joe:

	   ALTER AGGREGATE myavg(integer) OWNER TO joe;

       To move the aggregate function myavg for type integer into schema
       myschema:

	   ALTER AGGREGATE myavg(integer) SET SCHEMA myschema;

COMPATIBILITY
       There is no ALTER AGGREGATE statement in the SQL standard.
