NAME
       PPI::Normal - Normalize Perl Documents

   DESCRIPTION
       Perl Documents, as created by PPI, are typically filled with all sorts
       of mess such as whitespace and comments and other things that don't
       effect the actual meaning of the code.

       In addition, because there is more than one way to do most things, and
       the syntax of Perl itself is quite flexible, there are many ways in
       which the "same" code can look quite different.

       PPI::Normal attempts to resolve this by providing a variety of
       mechanisms and algorithms to "normalize" Perl Documents, and determine
       a sort of base form for them (although this base form will be a memory
       structure, and not something that can be turned back into Perl source
       code).

       The process itself is quite complex, and so for convenience and
       extensibility it has been separated into a number of layers. At a later
       point, it will be possible to write Plugin classes to insert additional
       normalization steps into the various different layers.

       In addition, you can choose to do the normalization only as deep as a
       particular layer, depending on aggressively you want the normalization
       process to be.

METHODS
   register $function => $layer, ...
       The "register" method is used by normalization method providers to tell
       the normalization engines which functions need to be run, and in which
       layer they apply.

       Provide a set of key/value pairs, where the key is the full name of the
       function (in string form), and the value is the layer (see description
       of the layers above) in which it should be run.

       Returns true if all functions are registered, or "undef" on error.

   new
	 my $level_1 = PPI::Normal->new;
	 my $level_2 = PPI::Normal->new(2);

       Creates a new normalization object, to which Document objects can be
       passed to be normalized.

       Of course, what you probably REALLY want is just to call
       PPI::Document's "normalize" method.

       Takes an optional single parameter of the normalisation layer to use,
       which at this time can be either "1" or "2".

       Returns a new "PPI::Normal" object, or "undef" on error.

layer
       The "layer" accessor returns the normalisation layer of the object.

   process
       The "process" method takes anything that can be converted to a
       PPI::Document (object, SCALAR ref, filename), loads it and applies the
       normalisation process to the document.

       Returns a PPI::Document::Normalized object, or "undef" on error.

NOTES
       The following normalisation layers are implemented. When writing
       plugins, you should register each transformation function with the
       appropriate layer.

   Layer 1 - Insignificant Data Removal
       The basic step common to all normalization, layer 1 scans through the
       Document and removes all whitespace, comments, POD, and anything else
       that returns false for its "significant" method.

       It also checks each Element and removes known-useless sub-element
       metadata such as the Element's physical position in the file.

   Layer 2 - Significant Element Removal
       After the removal of the insignificant data, Layer 2 removed larger,
       more complex, and superficially "significant" elements, that can be
       removed for the purposes of normalisation.

       Examples from this layer include pragmas, now-useless statement
       separators (since the PDOM tree is holding statement elements), and
       several other minor bits and pieces.

   Layer 3 - TO BE COMPLETED
       This version of the forward-port of the Perl::Compare functionality to
       the 0.900+ API of PPI only implements Layer 1 and 2 at this time.

TO DO
       - Write the other 4-5 layers :)
