NAME
       git-symbolic-ref - Read and modify symbolic refs

SYNOPSIS
       git symbolic-ref [-m &ltreason&gt] &ltname&gt &ltref&gt
       git symbolic-ref [-q] [--short] &ltname&gt


DESCRIPTION
       Given one argument, reads which branch head the given symbolic ref
       refers to and outputs its path, relative to the .git/ directory.
       Typically you would give HEAD as the &ltname&gt argument to see which
       branch your working tree is on.

       Given two arguments, creates or updates a symbolic ref &ltname&gt to point
       at the given branch &ltref&gt.

       A symbolic ref is a regular file that stores a string that begins with
       ref: refs/. For example, your .git/HEAD is a regular file whose
       contents is ref: refs/heads/master.

OPTIONS
       -q, --quiet
	   Do not issue an error message if the &ltname&gt is not a symbolic ref
	   but a detached HEAD; instead exit with non-zero status silently.

       --short
	   When showing the value of &ltname&gt as a symbolic ref, try to shorten
	   the value, e.g. from refs/heads/master to master.

       -m
	   Update the reflog for &ltname&gt with &ltreason&gt. This is valid only when
	   creating or updating a symbolic ref.

NOTES
       In the past, .git/HEAD was a symbolic link pointing at
       refs/heads/master. When we wanted to switch to another branch, we did
       ln -sf refs/heads/newbranch .git/HEAD, and when we wanted to find out
       which branch we are on, we did readlink .git/HEAD. But symbolic links
       are not entirely portable, so they are now deprecated and symbolic refs
       (as described above) are used by default.

       git symbolic-ref will exit with status 0 if the contents of the
       symbolic ref were printed correctly, with status 1 if the requested
       name is not a symbolic ref, or 128 if another error occurs.
