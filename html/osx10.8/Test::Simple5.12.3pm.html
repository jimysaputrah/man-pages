Test::Simple(3pm)      Perl Programmers Reference Guide      Test::Simple(3pm)



NAME
       Test::Simple - Basic utilities for writing tests.

SYNOPSIS
	 use Test::Simple tests =&gt 1;

	 ok( $foo eq $bar, 'foo is bar' );

DESCRIPTION
       ** If you are unfamiliar with testing read Test::Tutorial first! **

       This is an extremely simple, extremely basic module for writing tests
       suitable for CPAN modules and other pursuits.  If you wish to do more
       complicated testing, use the Test::More module (a drop-in replacement
       for this one).

       The basic unit of Perl testing is the ok.  For each thing you want to
       test your program will print out an "ok" or "not ok" to indicate pass
       or fail.  You do this with the ok() function (see below).

       The only other constraint is you must pre-declare how many tests you
       plan to run.  This is in case something goes horribly wrong during the
       test and your test program aborts, or skips a test or whatever.	You do
       this like so:

	   use Test::Simple tests =&gt 23;

       You must have a plan.

       ok
	     ok( $foo eq $bar, $name );
	     ok( $foo eq $bar );

	   ok() is given an expression (in this case "$foo eq $bar").  If it's
	   true, the test passed.  If it's false, it didn't.  That's about it.

	   ok() prints out either "ok" or "not ok" along with a test number
	   (it keeps track of that for you).

	     # This produces "ok 1 - Hell not yet frozen over" (or not ok)
	     ok( get_temperature($hell) &gt 0, 'Hell not yet frozen over' );

	   If you provide a $name, that will be printed along with the "ok/not
	   ok" to make it easier to find your test when if fails (just search
	   for the name).  It also makes it easier for the next guy to
	   understand what your test is for.  It's highly recommended you use
	   test names.

	   All tests are run in scalar context.  So this:

	       ok( @stuff, 'I have some stuff' );

	   will do what you mean (fail if stuff is empty)

       Test::Simple will start by printing number of tests run in the form
       "1..M" (so "1..5" means you're going to run 5 tests).  This strange
       format lets Test::Harness know how many tests you plan on running in
       case something goes horribly wrong.

       If all your tests passed, Test::Simple will exit with zero (which is
       normal).  If anything failed it will exit with how many failed.	If you
       run less (or more) tests than you planned, the missing (or extras) will
       be considered failures.	If no tests were ever run Test::Simple will
       throw a warning and exit with 255.  If the test died, even after having
       successfully completed all its tests, it will still be considered a
       failure and will exit with 255.

       So the exit codes are...

	   0		       all tests successful
	   255		       test died or all passed but wrong # of tests run
	   any other number    how many failed (including missing or extras)

       If you fail more than 254 tests, it will be reported as 254.

       This module is by no means trying to be a complete testing system.
       It's just to get you started.  Once you're off the ground its
       recommended you look at Test::More.

EXAMPLE
       Here's an example of a simple .t file for the fictional Film module.

	   use Test::Simple tests =&gt 5;

	   use Film;  # What you're testing.

	   my $btaste = Film-&gtnew({ Title    =&gt 'Bad Taste',
				    Director =&gt 'Peter Jackson',
				    Rating   =&gt 'R',
				    NumExplodingSheep =&gt 1
				  });
	   ok( defined($btaste) && ref $btaste eq 'Film,     'new() works' );

	   ok( $btaste-&gtTitle	   eq 'Bad Taste',     'Title() get'	);
	   ok( $btaste-&gtDirector   eq 'Peter Jackson', 'Director() get' );
	   ok( $btaste-&gtRating	   eq 'R',	       'Rating() get'	);
	   ok( $btaste-&gtNumExplodingSheep == 1,        'NumExplodingSheep() get' );

       It will produce output like this:

	   1..5
	   ok 1 - new() works
	   ok 2 - Title() get
	   ok 3 - Director() get
	   not ok 4 - Rating() get
	   #   Failed test 'Rating() get'
	   #   in t/film.t at line 14.
	   ok 5 - NumExplodingSheep() get
	   # Looks like you failed 1 tests of 5

       Indicating the Film::Rating() method is broken.

CAVEATS
       Test::Simple will only report a maximum of 254 failures in its exit
       code.  If this is a problem, you probably have a huge test script.
       Split it into multiple files.  (Otherwise blame the Unix folks for
       using an unsigned short integer as the exit status).

       Because VMS's exit codes are much, much different than the rest of the
       universe, and perl does horrible mangling to them that gets in my way,
       it works like this on VMS.

	   0	 SS$_NORMAL	   all tests successful
	   4	 SS$_ABORT	   something went wrong

       Unfortunately, I can't differentiate any further.

NOTES
       Test::Simple is explicitly tested all the way back to perl 5.6.0.

       Test::Simple is thread-safe in perl 5.8.1 and up.

HISTORY
       This module was conceived while talking with Tony Bowden in his kitchen
       one night about the problems I was having writing some really
       complicated feature into the new Testing module.  He observed that the
       main problem is not dealing with these edge cases but that people hate
       to write tests at all.  What was needed was a dead simple module that
       took all the hard work out of testing and was really, really easy to
       learn.  Paul Johnson simultaneously had this idea (unfortunately, he
       wasn't in Tony's kitchen).  This is it.

SEE ALSO
       Test::More
	   More testing functions!  Once you outgrow Test::Simple, look at
	   Test::More.	Test::Simple is 100% forward compatible with
	   Test::More (i.e. you can just use Test::More instead of
	   Test::Simple in your programs and things will still work).

       Look in Test::More's SEE ALSO for more testing modules.
