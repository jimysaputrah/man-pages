Description
       "Apache2::RequestRec" provides the Perl API for Apache request_rec
       object.

       The following packages extend the "Apache2::RequestRec" functionality:
       "Apache2::Access", "Apache2::Log", "Apache2::RequestIO",
       "Apache2::RequestUtil", "Apache2::Response", "Apache2::SubRequest" and
       "Apache2::URI".

API
       "Apache2::RequestRec" provides the following functions and/or methods:

   "allowed"
       Get/set the allowed methods bitmask.

	 $allowed      = $r-&gtallowed();
	 $prev_allowed = $r-&gtallowed($new_allowed);

       obj: $r ( "Apache2::RequestRec object" )
       opt arg1: $new_allowed ( bitmask )
	   Set the bitvector.

       ret: $allowed ( bitmask )
	   returns $allowed, which is a bitvector of the allowed methods.

	   If the $new_allowed argument is passed, the value before the change
	   is returned.

       since: 2.0.00

       A handler must ensure that the request method is one that it is capable
       of handling.  Generally modules should "Apache2::DECLINE" any request
       methods they do not handle.  Prior to aborting the handler like this
       the handler should set "$r-&gtallowed" to the list of methods that it is
       willing to handle.  This bitvector is used to construct the "Allow:"
       header required for "OPTIONS" requests, and
       "Apache2::Const::HTTP_METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED" (405) and
       "Apache2::Const::HTTP_NOT_IMPLEMENTED" (501) status codes.

       Since the default Apache handler deals with the "OPTIONS" method, all
       response handlers can usually decline to deal with "OPTIONS". For
       example if the response handler handles only "GET" and "POST" methods,
       and not "OPTIONS", it may want to say:

	  use Apache2::Const -compile =&gt qw(OK DECLINED M_GET M_POST M_OPTIONS);
	  if ($r-&gtmethod_number == Apache2::Const::M_OPTIONS) {
	      $r-&gtallowed($r-&gtallowed | (1&lt&ltApache2::Const::M_GET) | (1&lt&ltApache2::Const::M_POST));
	      return Apache2::Const::DECLINED;
	  }

       "TRACE" is always allowed, modules don't need to set it explicitly.

       Since the default_handler will always handle a "GET", a module which
       does *not* implement "GET" should probably return
       "Apache2::Const::HTTP_METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED".  Unfortunately this means
       that a script "GET" handler can't be installed by mod_actions.

       For example, if the module can handle only POST method it could start
       with:

	  use Apache2::Const -compile =&gt qw(M_POST HTTP_METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED);
	  unless ($r-&gtmethod_number == Apache2::Const::M_POST) {
	      $r-&gtallowed($r-&gtallowed | (1&lt&ltApache2::Const::M_POST));
	      return Apache2::Const::HTTP_METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED;
	  }

   "ap_auth_type"
       If an authentication check was made, get or set the ap_auth_type slot
       in the request record

	 $auth_type = $r-&gtap_auth_type();
	 $r-&gtap_auth_type($newval);

       obj: $r ( "Apache2::RequestRec object" )
       opt arg1: $newval (string)
	   If this argument is passed then a new auth type is assigned. For
	   example:

	     $r-&gtauth_type('Basic');

       ret: $auth_type (string)
	   If $newval is passed, nothing is returned. Otherwise the current
	   auth type is returned.

       since: 2.0.00

       ap_auth_type holds the authentication type that has been negotiated
       between the client and server during the actual request.  Generally,
       ap_auth_type is populated automatically when you call
       "$r-&gtget_basic_auth_pw" so you don't really need to worry too much
       about it, but if you want to roll your own authentication mechanism
       then you will have to populate ap_auth_type yourself.

       Note that "$r-&gtap_auth_type" was "$r-&gtconnection-&gtauth_type" in the
       mod_perl 1.0 API.

   "args"
       Get/set the request QUERY string

	 $args	    = $r-&gtargs();
	 $prev_args = $r-&gtargs($new_args);

       obj: $r ( "Apache2::RequestRec object" )
       opt arg1: $new_args ( string )
	   Optionally set the new QUERY string

       ret: $args ( string )
	   The current QUERY string

	   If $new_args was passed, returns the value before the change.

       since: 2.0.00

   "assbackwards"
       When set to a true value, Apache won't send any HTTP response headers
       allowing you to send any headers.

	 $status      = $r-&gtassbackwards();
	 $prev_status = $r-&gtassbackwards($newval);

       obj: $r ( "Apache2::RequestRec object" )
       opt arg1: $newval (integer)
	   assign a new state.

       ret: $status (integer)
	   current state.

       since: 2.0.00

       If you send your own set of headers, which includes the "Keep-Alive"
       HTTP response header, you must make sure to increment the number of
       requests served over this connection (which is normally done by the
       core connection output filter "ap_http_header_filter", but skipped when
       "assbackwards" is enabled).

	 $r-&gtconnection-&gtkeepalives($r-&gtconnection-&gtkeepalives + 1);

       otherwise code relying on the value of "$r-&gtconnection-&gtkeepalives" may
       malfunction. For example, this counter is used to tell when a new
       request is coming in over the same connection to a filter that wants to
       parse only HTTP headers (like "Apache2::Filter::HTTPHeadersFixup"). Of
       course you will need to set "$r-&gtconnection-&gtkeepalive(1)" ) as well.

   "bytes_sent"
       The number of bytes sent to the client, handy for logging, etc.

	 $bytes_sent = $r-&gtbytes_sent();

       obj: $r ( "Apache2::RequestRec object" )
       ret: $bytes_sent (integer)
       since: 2.0.00

       Though as of this writing in Apache 2.0 it doesn't really do what it
       did in Apache 1.3. It's just set to the size of the response body.  The
       issue is that buckets from one request may get buffered and not sent
       during the lifetime of the request, so it's not easy to give a truly
       accurate count of "bytes sent to the network for this response".

   "connection"
       Get the client connection record

	 $c = $r-&gtconnection();

       obj: $r ( "Apache2::RequestRec object" )
       ret: $c ( "Apache2::Connection object" )
       since: 2.0.00

   "content_encoding"
       Get/set content encoding (the "Content-Encoding" HTTP header).  Content
       encodings are string like "gzip" or "compress".

	 $ce	  = $r-&gtcontent_encoding();
	 $prev_ce = $r-&gtcontent_encoding($new_ce);

       obj: $r ( "Apache2::RequestRec object" )
       opt arg1: $new_ce ( string )
	   If passed, sets the content encoding to a new value. It must be a
	   lowercased string.

       ret: $ce ( string )
	   The current content encoding.

	   If $new_ce is passed, then the previous value is returned.

       since: 2.0.00

       For example, here is how to send a gzip'ed response:

	 require Compress::Zlib;
	 $r-&gtcontent_type("text/plain");
	 $r-&gtcontent_encoding("gzip");
	 $r-&gtprint(Compress::Zlib::memGzip("some text to be gzipped));

   "content_languages"
       Get/set content languages (the "Content-Language" HTTP header).
       Content languages are string like "en" or "fr".

	 $languages = $r-&gtcontent_languages();
	 $prev_lang = $r-&gtcontent_languages($nev_lang);

       obj: $r ( "Apache2::RequestRec object" )
       opt arg1: $new_lang ( ARRAY ref )
	   If passed, sets the content languages to new values. It must be an
	   ARRAY reference of language names, like "en" or "fr"

       ret: $languages ( ARRAY ref )
	   The current list of content languages, as an ARRAY reference.

	   If $new_lang is passed, then the previous value is returned.

       since: 2.0.00

   "content_type"
       Get/set the HTTP response Content-type header value.

	 my $content_type      = $r-&gtcontent_type();
	 my $prev_content_type = $r-&gtcontent_type($new_content_type);

       obj: $r ( "Apache2::RequestRec object" )
       opt arg1: $new_content_type (MIME type string)
	   Assign a new HTTP response content-type. It will affect the
	   response only if HTTP headers weren't sent yet.

       ret: $content_type
	   The current content-type value.

	   If $new_content_type was passed, the previous value is returned
	   instead.

       since: 2.0.00

       For example, set the "Content-type" header to text/plain.

	 $r-&gtcontent_type('text/plain');

       If you set this header via the "headers_out" table directly, it will be
       ignored by Apache. So do not do that.

   "err_headers_out"
       Get/set MIME response headers, printed even on errors and persist
       across internal redirects.

	 $err_headers_out = $r-&gterr_headers_out();

       obj: $r ( "Apache2::RequestRec object" )
       ret: $err_headers_out ( "APR::Table object" )
       since: 2.0.00

       The difference between "headers_out" and "err_headers_out", is that the
       latter are printed even on error, and persist across internal redirects
       (so the headers printed for "ErrorDocument" handlers will have them).

       For example, if a handler wants to return a 404 response, but
       nevertheless to set a cookie, it has to be:

	 $r-&gterr_headers_out-&gtadd('Set-Cookie' =&gt $cookie);
	 return Apache2::Const::NOT_FOUND;

       If the handler does:

	 $r-&gtheaders_out-&gtadd('Set-Cookie' =&gt $cookie);
	 return Apache2::Const::NOT_FOUND;

       the "Set-Cookie" header won't be sent.

   "filename"
       Get/set the filename on disk corresponding to this response (the result
       of the URI --&gt filename translation).

	 $filename	= $r-&gtfilename();
	 $prev_filename = $r-&gtfilename($new_filename);

       obj: $r ( "Apache2::RequestRec object" )
       opt arg1: $new_filename ( string )
	   new value

       ret: $filename ( string )
	   the current filename, or the previous value if the optional
	   $new_filename argument was passed

       since: 2.0.00

       Note that if you change the filename after the
       "PerlMapToStorageHandler" phase was run and expect Apache to serve it,
       you need to update its "stat" record, like so:

	 use Apache2::RequestRec ();
	 use APR::Finfo ();
	 use APR::Const -compile =&gt qw(FINFO_NORM);
	 $r-&gtfilename($newfile);
	 $r-&gtfinfo(APR::Finfo::stat($newfile, APR::Const::FINFO_NORM, $r-&gtpool));

       if you don't, Apache will still try to use the previously cached
       information about the previously set value of the filename.

   "finfo"
       Get and set the finfo request record member:

	 $finfo = $r-&gtfinfo();
	 $r-&gtfinfo($finfo);

       obj: $r ( "Apache2::RequestRec object" )
       opt arg1: $finfo ( "APR::Finfo object" )
       ret: $finfo ( "APR::Finfo object" )
	   Always returns the current object.

	   Due to the internal Apache implementation it's not possible to have
	   two different objects originating from "$r-&gtfinfo" at the same
	   time. Whenever "$r-&gtfinfo" is updated all objects will be updated
	   too to the latest value.

       since: 2.0.00

       Most of the time, this method is used to get the "finfo" member. The
       only reason you may want to set it is you need to use it before the
       Apache's default map_to_storage phase is called.

       Examples:

       o   What Apache thinks is the current request filename (post the
	   "PerlMapToStorageHandler" phase):

	     use Apache2::RequestRec ();
	     use APR::Finfo ();
	     print $r-&gtfinfo-&gtfname;

       o   Populate the "finfo" member (normally, before the
	   "PerlMapToStorageHandler" phase):

	     use APR::Finfo ();
	     use APR::Const -compile =&gt qw(FINFO_NORM);

	     my $finfo = APR::Finfo::stat(__FILE__, APR::Const::FINFO_NORM, $r-&gtpool);
	     $r-&gtfinfo($finfo);

   "handler"
       Get/set the equivalent of the "SetHandler" directive.

	 $handler      = $r-&gthandler();
	 $prev_handler = $r-&gthandler($new_handler);

       obj: $r ( "Apache2::RequestRec object" )
       opt arg1: $new_handler ( string )
	   the new handler.

       ret: $handler ( string )
	   the current handler.

	   If $new_handler is passed, the previous value is returned.

       since: 2.0.00

   "header_only"
       Did the client has asked for headers only? e.g. if the request method
       was HEAD.

	 $status = $r-&gtheader_only();

       obj: $r ( "Apache2::RequestRec object" )
       ret: $status ( boolean )
	   Returns true if the client is asking for headers only, false
	   otherwise

       since: 2.0.00

   "headers_in"
       Get/set the request MIME headers:

	 $headers_in = $r-&gtheaders_in();

       obj: $r ( "Apache2::RequestRec object" )
       ret: $headers_in ( "APR::Table object" )
       since: 2.0.00

       This table is available starting from the "PerlHeaderParserHandler"
       phase.

       For example you can use it to retrieve the cookie value sent by the
       client, in the "Cookie:" header:

	   my $cookie = $r-&gtheaders_in-&gt{Cookie} || '';

   "headers_out"
       Get/set MIME response headers, printed only on 2xx responses.

	 $headers_out = $r-&gtheaders_out();

       obj: $r ( "Apache2::RequestRec object" )
       ret: $headers_out ( "APR::Table object" )
       since: 2.0.00

       See also "err_headers_out", which allows to set headers for non-2xx
       responses and persist across internal redirects.

   "hostname"
       Host, as set by full URI or Host:

	 $hostname = $r-&gthostname();
	 $prev_hostname = $r-&gthostname($new_hostname);

       obj: $r ( "Apache2::RequestRec object" )
       opt arg1: $new_hostname ( string )
	   new value

       ret: $hostname ( string )
	   the current hostname, or the previous value if the optional
	   $new_hostname argument was passed

       since: 2.0.00

   "input_filters"
       Get/set the first filter in a linked list of request level input
       filters:

	 $input_filters      = $r-&gtinput_filters();
	 $prev_input_filters = $r-&gtinput_filters($new_input_filters);

       obj: $r ( "Apache2::RequestRec object" )
       opt arg1: $new_input_filters
	   Set a new value

       ret: $input_filters ( "Apache2::Filter object" )
	   The first filter in the request level input filters chain.

	   If $new_input_filters was passed, returns the previous value.

       since: 2.0.00

       For example instead of using "$r-&gtread()" to read the POST data, one
       could use an explicit walk through incoming bucket brigades to get that
       data. The following function "read_post()" does just that (in fact
       that's what "$r-&gtread()" does behind the scenes):

	 use APR::Brigade ();
	 use APR::Bucket ();
	 use Apache2::Filter ();

	 use Apache2::Const -compile =&gt qw(MODE_READBYTES);
	 use APR::Const    -compile =&gt qw(SUCCESS BLOCK_READ);

	 use constant IOBUFSIZE =&gt 8192;

	 sub read_post {
	     my $r = shift;

	     my $bb = APR::Brigade-&gtnew($r-&gtpool,
					$r-&gtconnection-&gtbucket_alloc);

	     my $data = '';
	     my $seen_eos = 0;
	     do {
		 $r-&gtinput_filters-&gtget_brigade($bb, Apache2::Const::MODE_READBYTES,
						APR::Const::BLOCK_READ, IOBUFSIZE);

		 for (my $b = $bb-&gtfirst; $b; $b = $bb-&gtnext($b)) {
		     if ($b-&gtis_eos) {
			 $seen_eos++;
			 last;
		     }

		     if ($b-&gtread(my $buf)) {
			 $data .= $buf;
		     }

		     $b-&gtremove; # optimization to reuse memory
		 }

	     } while (!$seen_eos);

	     $bb-&gtdestroy;

	     return $data;
	 }

       As you can see "$r-&gtinput_filters" gives us a pointer to the last of
       the top of the incoming filters stack.

   "main"
       Get the main request record

	 $main_r = $r-&gtmain();

       obj: $r ( "Apache2::RequestRec object" )
       ret: $main_r ( "Apache2::RequestRec object" )
	   If the current request is a sub-request, this method returns a
	   blessed reference to the main request structure. If the current
	   request is the main request, then this method returns "undef".

	   To figure out whether you are inside a main request or a
	   sub-request/internal redirect, use "$r-&gtis_initial_req".

       since: 2.0.00

   "method"
       Get/set the current request method (e.g. "GET", "HEAD", "POST", etc.):

	 $method     = $r-&gtmethod();
	 $pre_method = $r-&gtmethod($new_method);

       obj: $r ( "Apache2::RequestRec object" )
       opt arg1: $new_method ( string )
	   a new value

       ret: $method ( string )
	   The current method as a string

	   if $new_method was passed the previous value is returned.

       since: 2.0.00

   "method_number"
       Get/set the HTTP method, issued by the client ("Apache2::Const::M_GET",
       "Apache2::Const::M_POST", etc.)

	 $methnum      = $r-&gtmethod_number();
	 $prev_methnum = $r-&gtmethod_number($new_methnum);

       obj: $r ( "Apache2::RequestRec object" )
       opt arg1: $new_methnum ( "Apache2::Const :methods constant" )
	   a new value

       ret: $methnum ( "Apache2::Const :methods constant" )
	   The current method as a number

	   if $new_methnum was passed the previous value is returned.

       since: 2.0.00

       See the "$r-&gtallowed" entry for examples.

   "mtime"
       Last modified time of the requested resource

	 $mtime      = $r-&gtmtime();
	 $prev_mtime = $r-&gtmtime($new_mtime);

       obj: $r ( "Apache2::RequestRec object" )
       opt arg1: $new_mtime (epoch seconds).
	   a new value

       ret: $mtime (epoch seconds).
	   the current value

	   if $new_mtime was passed the previous value is returned.

       since: 2.0.00

   "next"
       Pointer to the redirected request if this is an external redirect

	 $next_r = $r-&gtnext();

       obj: $r ( "Apache2::RequestRec object" )
       ret: $next_r ( "Apache2::RequestRec object" )
	   returns a blessed reference to the next (internal) request
	   structure or "undef" if there is no next request.

       since: 2.0.00

   "no_local_copy"
       There is no local copy of this response

	 $status = $r-&gtno_local_copy();

       obj: $r ( "Apache2::RequestRec object" )
       ret: $status (integer)
       since: 2.0.00

       Used internally in certain sub-requests to prevent sending
       "Apache2::Const::HTTP_NOT_MODIFIED" for a fragment or error documents.
       For example see the implementation in modules/filters/mod_include.c.

       Also used internally in "$r-&gtmeets_conditions" -- if set to a true
       value, the conditions are always met.

   "notes"
       Get/set text notes for the duration of this request. These notes can be
       passed from one module to another (not only mod_perl, but modules in
       any other language):

	 $notes      = $r-&gtnotes();
	 $prev_notes = $r-&gtnotes($new_notes);

       obj: $r ( "Apache2::RequestRec object" )
       opt arg1: $new_notes ( "APR::Table object" )
       ret: $notes ( "APR::Table object" )
	   the current notes table.

	   if the $new_notes argument was passed, returns the previous value.

       since: 2.0.00

       If you want to pass Perl structures, you can use "$r-&gtpnotes".

       Also see "$c-&gtnotes"

   "output_filters"
       Get the first filter in a linked list of request level output filters:

	 $output_filters      = $r-&gtoutput_filters();
	 $prev_output_filters = $r-&gtoutput_filters($new_output_filters);

       obj: $r ( "Apache2::RequestRec object" )
       opt arg1: $new_output_filters
	   Set a new value

       ret: $output_filters ( "Apache2::Filter object" )
	   The first filter in the request level output filters chain.

	   If $new_output_filters was passed, returns the previous value.

       since: 2.0.00

       For example instead of using "$r-&gtprint()" to send the response body,
       one could send the data directly to the first output filter. The
       following function "send_response_body()" does just that:

	 use APR::Brigade ();
	 use APR::Bucket ();
	 use Apache2::Filter ();

	 sub send_response_body {
	     my ($r, $data) = @_;

	     my $bb = APR::Brigade-&gtnew($r-&gtpool,
					$r-&gtconnection-&gtbucket_alloc);

	     my $b = APR::Bucket-&gtnew($bb-&gtbucket_alloc, $data);
	     $bb-&gtinsert_tail($b);
	     $r-&gtoutput_filters-&gtfflush($bb);
	     $bb-&gtdestroy;
	 }

       In fact that's what "$r-&gtread()" does behind the scenes. But it also
       knows to parse HTTP headers passed together with the data and it also
       implements buffering, which the above function does not.

   "path_info"
       Get/set the "PATH_INFO", what is left in the path after the URI --&gt
       filename translation:

	 $path_info	 = $r-&gtpath_info();
	 $prev_path_info = $r-&gtpath_info($path_info);

       obj: $r ( "Apache2::RequestRec object" )
       opt arg1: $path_info ( string )
	   Set a new value

       ret: $path_info ( string )
	   Return the current value.

	   If the optional argument $path_info is passed, the previous value
	   is returned.

       since: 2.0.00

   "per_dir_config"
       Get the dir config vector:

	 $per_dir_config = $r-&gtper_dir_config();

       obj: $r ( "Apache2::RequestRec object" )
       ret: $per_dir_config ( "Apache2::ConfVector object" )
       since: 2.0.00

       For an indepth discussion, refer to the Apache Server Configuration
       Customization in Perl chapter.

   "pool"
       The pool associated with the request

	 $p = $r-&gtpool();

       obj: $r ( "Apache2::RequestRec object" )
       ret: $p ( "APR::Pool object" )
       since: 2.0.00

   "prev"
       Pointer to the previous request if this is an internal redirect

	 $prev_r = $r-&gtprev();

       obj: $r ( "Apache2::RequestRec object" )
       ret: $prev_r ( "Apache2::RequestRec object" )
	   a blessed reference to the previous (internal) request structure or
	   "undef" if there is no previous request.

       since: 2.0.00

   "proto_input_filters"
       Get the first filter in a linked list of protocol level input filters:

	 $proto_input_filters	   = $r-&gtproto_input_filters();
	 $prev_proto_input_filters = $r-&gtproto_input_filters($new_proto_input_filters);

       obj: $r ( "Apache2::RequestRec object" )
       opt arg1: $new_proto_input_filters
	   Set a new value

       ret: $proto_input_filters ( "Apache2::Filter object" )
	   The first filter in the protocol level input filters chain.

	   If $new_proto_input_filters was passed, returns the previous value.

       since: 2.0.00

       "$r-&gtproto_input_filters" points to the same filter as
       "$r-&gtconnection-&gtinput_filters".

   "proto_num"
       Get current request's HTTP protocol version number

	 $proto_num = $r-&gtproto_num();

       obj: $r ( "Apache2::RequestRec object" )
       ret: $proto_num (integer)
	   current request's HTTP protocol version number, e.g.: HTTP/1.0 ==
	   1000, HTTP/1.1 = 1001

       since: 2.0.00

   "proto_output_filters"
       Get the first filter in a linked list of protocol level output filters:

	 $proto_output_filters	    = $r-&gtproto_output_filters();
	 $prev_proto_output_filters = $r-&gtproto_output_filters($new_proto_output_filters);

       obj: $r ( "Apache2::RequestRec object" )
       opt arg1: $new_proto_output_filters
	   Set a new value

       ret: $proto_output_filters ( "Apache2::Filter object" )
	   The first filter in the protocol level output filters chain.

	   If $new_proto_output_filters was passed, returns the previous
	   value.

       since: 2.0.00

       "$r-&gtproto_output_filters" points to the same filter as
       "$r-&gtconnection-&gtoutput_filters".

   "protocol"
       Get a string identifying the protocol that the client speaks.

	 $protocol = $r-&gtprotocol();

       obj: $r ( "Apache2::RequestRec object" )
       ret: $protocl ( string )
	   Typical values are "HTTP/1.0" or "HTTP/1.1".

	   If the client didn't specify the protocol version, the default is
	   "HTTP/0.9"

       since: 2.0.00

   "proxyreq"
       Get/set the proxyrec request record member and optionally adjust other
       related fields.

	 $status = $r-&gtproxyreq($val);

       obj: $r ( "Apache2::RequestRec object" )
       opt arg1: $val ( integer )
	   PROXYREQ_NONE, PROXYREQ_PROXY, PROXYREQ_REVERSE, PROXYREQ_RESPONSE

       ret: $status ( integer )
	   If $val is defined the proxyrec member will be set to that value
	   and previous value will be returned.

	   If $val is not passed, and "$r-&gtproxyreq" is not true, and the
	   proxy request is matching the current vhost (scheme, hostname and
	   port), the proxyrec member will be set to PROXYREQ_PROXY and that
	   value will be returned. In addition "$r-&gturi" is set to
	   "$r-&gtunparsed_uri" and "$r-&gtfilename" is set to
	   ""modperl-proxy:".$r-&gturi". If those conditions aren't true 0 is
	   returned.

       since: 2.0.00

       For example to turn a normal request into a proxy request to be handled
       on the same server in the "PerlTransHandler" phase run:

	 my $real_url = $r-&gtunparsed_uri;
	 $r-&gtproxyreq(Apache2::Const::PROXYREQ_PROXY);
	 $r-&gturi($real_url);
	 $r-&gtfilename("proxy:$real_url");
	 $r-&gthandler('proxy-server');

       Also remember that if you want to turn a proxy request into a non-proxy
       request, it's not enough to call:

	 $r-&gtproxyreq(Apache2::Const::PROXYREQ_NONE);

       You need to adjust "$r-&gturi" and "$r-&gtfilename" as well if you run that
       code in "PerlPostReadRequestHandler" phase, since if you don't --
       "mod_proxy"'s own post_read_request handler will override your settings
       (as it will run after the mod_perl handler).

       And you may also want to add

	 $r-&gtset_handlers(PerlResponseHandler =&gt []);

       so that any response handlers which match apache directives will not
       run in addition to the mod_proxy content handler.

   "request_time"
       Time when the request started

	 $request_time = $r-&gtrequest_time();

       obj: $r ( "Apache2::RequestRec object" )
       ret: $request_time (epoch seconds).
       since: 2.0.00

   "server"
       Get the "Apache2::Server" object for the server the request $r is
       running under.

	 $s = $r-&gtserver();

       obj: $r ( "Apache2::RequestRec object" )
       ret: $s ( "Apache2::ServerRec object" )
       since: 2.0.00

   "status"
       Get/set the reply status for the client request.

	 $status      = $r-&gtstatus();
	 $prev_status = $r-&gtstatus($new_status);

       obj: $r ( "Apache2::RequestRec object" )
       opt arg1: $new_status ( integer )
	   If $new_status is passed the new status is assigned.

	   Normally you would use some "Apache2::Const constant", e.g.
	   "Apache2::Const::REDIRECT".

       ret: $newval ( integer )
	   The current value.

	   If $new_status is passed the old value is returned.

       since: 2.0.00

       Usually you will set this value indirectly by returning the status code
       as the handler's function result.  However, there are rare instances
       when you want to trick Apache into thinking that the module returned an
       "Apache2::Const::OK" status code, but actually send the browser a non-
       OK status. This may come handy when implementing an HTTP proxy handler.
       The proxy handler needs to send to the client, whatever status code the
       proxied server has returned, while returning "Apache2::Const::OK" to
       Apache. e.g.:

	 $r-&gtstatus($some_code);
	 return Apache2::Const::OK

       See also "$r-&gtstatus_line", which. if set, overrides "$r-&gtstatus".

   "status_line"
       Get/set the response status line.  The status line is a string like
       "200 Document follows" and it will take precedence over the value
       specified using the "$r-&gtstatus()" described above.

	 $status_line	   = $r-&gtstatus_line();
	 $prev_status_line = $r-&gtstatus_line($new_status_line);

       obj: $r ( "Apache2::RequestRec object" )
       opt arg1: $new_status_line ( string )
       ret: $status_line ( string )
       since: 2.0.00

       When discussing "$r-&gtstatus" we have mentioned that sometimes a handler
       runs to a successful completion, but may need to return a different
       code, which is the case with the proxy server. Assuming that the proxy
       handler forwards to the client whatever response the proxied server has
       sent, it'll usually use "status_line()", like so:

	 $r-&gtstatus_line($response-&gtcode() . ' ' . $response-&gtmessage());
	 return Apache2::Const::OK;

       In this example $response could be for example an "HTTP::Response"
       object, if "LWP::UserAgent" was used to implement the proxy.

       This method is also handy when you extend the HTTP protocol and add new
       response codes. For example you could invent a new error code and tell
       Apache to use that in the response like so:

	 $r-&gtstatus_line("499 We have been FooBared");
	 return Apache2::Const::OK;

       Here 499 is the new response code, and We have been FooBared is the
       custom response message.

   "subprocess_env"
       Get/set the Apache "subprocess_env" table, or optionally set the value
       of a named entry.

		      $r-&gtsubprocess_env;
	 $env_table = $r-&gtsubprocess_env;

		$r-&gtsubprocess_env($key =&gt $val);
	 $val = $r-&gtsubprocess_env($key);

       obj: $r ( "Apache2::RequestRec object" )
       opt arg1: $key ( string )
       opt arg2: $val ( string )
       ret: "..."
       since: 2.0.00

       When called in VOID context with no arguments, it populate %ENV with
       special variables (e.g. $ENV{QUERY_STRING}) like mod_cgi does.

       When called in a non-VOID context with no arguments, it returns an
       "APR::Table object".

       When the $key argument (string) is passed, it returns the corresponding
       value (if such exists, or "undef". The following two lines are
       equivalent:

	 $val = $r-&gtsubprocess_env($key);
	 $val = $r-&gtsubprocess_env-&gtget($key);

       When the $key and the $val arguments (strings) are passed, the value is
       set. The following two lines are equivalent:

	 $r-&gtsubprocess_env($key =&gt $val);
	 $r-&gtsubprocess_env-&gtset($key =&gt $val);

       The "subprocess_env" "table" is used by "Apache2::SubProcess", to pass
       environment variables to externally spawned processes. It's also used
       by various Apache modules, and you should use this table to pass the
       environment variables. For example if in "PerlHeaderParserHandler" you
       do:

	  $r-&gtsubprocess_env(MyLanguage =&gt "de");

       you can then deploy "mod_include" and write in .shtml document:

	  &lt!--#if expr="$MyLanguage = en" --&gt
	  English
	  &lt!--#elif expr="$MyLanguage = de" --&gt
	  Deutsch
	  &lt!--#else --&gt
	  Sorry
	  &lt!--#endif --&gt

   "the_request"
       First HTTP request header

	 $request = $r-&gtthe_request();
	 $old_request = $r-&gturi($new_request);

       obj: $r ( "Apache2::RequestRec object" )
       opt arg1: $new_request ( string )
       ret: $request ( string )
	   For example:

	     GET /foo/bar/my_path_info?args=3 HTTP/1.0

       since: 2.0.00

   "unparsed_uri"
       The URI without any parsing performed

	 $unparsed_uri = $r-&gtunparsed_uri();

       obj: $r ( "Apache2::RequestRec object" )
       ret: $unparsed_uri ( string )
       since: 2.0.00

       If for example the request was:

	 GET /foo/bar/my_path_info?args=3 HTTP/1.0

       "$r-&gturi" returns:

	 /foo/bar/my_path_info

       whereas "$r-&gtunparsed_uri" returns:

	 /foo/bar/my_path_info?args=3

   "uri"
       The path portion of the URI

	 $uri	      = $r-&gturi();
	 my $prec_uri = $r-&gturi($new_uri);

       obj: $r ( "Apache2::RequestRec object" )
       opt arg1: $new_uri ( string )
       ret: $uri ( string )
       since: 2.0.00

       See the example in the "$r-&gtunparsed_uri" section.

   "user"
       Get the user name, if an authentication process was successful. Or set
       it.

	 $user	    = $r-&gtuser();
	 $prev_user = $r-&gtuser($new_user);

       obj: $r ( "Apache2::RequestRec object" )
       opt arg1: $new_user ( string )
	   Pass $new_user to set a new value

       ret: $user ( string )
	   The current username if an authentication process was successful.

	   If $new_user was passed, the previous value is returned.

       since: 2.0.00

       For example, let's print the username passed by the client:

	 my ($res, $sent_pw) = $r-&gtget_basic_auth_pw;
	 return $res if $res != Apache2::Const::OK;
	 print "User: ", $r-&gtuser;

Unsupported API
       "Apache2::RequestRec" also provides auto-generated Perl interface for a
       few other methods which aren't tested at the moment and therefore their
       API is a subject to change. These methods will be finalized later as a
       need arises. If you want to rely on any of the following methods please
       contact the the mod_perl development mailing list so we can help each
       other take the steps necessary to shift the method to an officially
       supported API.

   "allowed_methods"

   "request_config"
       Config vector containing pointers to request's per-server config
       structures

       obj: $r ( "Apache2::RequestRec object" )
       opt arg1: $newval ( "Apache2::ConfVector object" )
       since: 2.0.00

   "used_path_info"
       META: Autogenerated - needs to be reviewed/completed

       Flag for the handler to accept or reject path_info on the current
       request.  All modules should respect the AP_REQ_ACCEPT_PATH_INFO and
       AP_REQ_REJECT_PATH_INFO values, while AP_REQ_DEFAULT_PATH_INFO
       indicates they may follow existing conventions.	This is set to the
       user's preference upon HOOK_VERY_FIRST of the fixups.
