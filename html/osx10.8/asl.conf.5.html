NAME
     asl.conf -- configuration file for syslogd(8) and aslmanager(8)

DESCRIPTION
     The syslogd(8) server reads the asl.conf file at startup, and re-reads
     the file whenever it received a HUP signal.  The aslmanager(8) daemon
     reads the file when it starts.  See the ASLMANAGER PARAMETER SETTINGS
     section below for details on those parameter settings.

     The file may contain parameter settings, used in place of (and which will
     override) command-line options, and may contain query-action rules that
     trigger specific actions when syslogd receives messages that match the
     query pattern.

     Parameter setting lines in the configuration file begin with an equal
     sign ``='', and are generally of the form:

	   = parameter_name value ...

     Most parameter settings require a single value, although some may take
     several values.  See the PARAMETER SETTINGS section below for details.

     Query-action rules in the file begin with a question-mark ``?'' or a
     ``Q'', and generally have the form:

	   ? query action ...

     Specific actions may be followed by optional arguments.  See the QUERY-
     ACTION RULES section below for details.

PARAMETER SETTINGS
     The following parameter-settings are recognized by syslogd.

	   debug	     Enables or disables internal debugging output.
			     This is probably of little interest to most
			     users.  The debug parameter requires a value of
			     ``1'' to enable debug output, or a value of ``0''
			     to disable it.  An option file name may follow
			     the ``0'' or ``1''.  If a file name is provided,
			     debug messages are written to that file.  Other-
			     wise, debug writes are treated as log messages.

	   mark_time	     Sets the time interval for the mark facility.
			     The default is 0 seconds, which indicates that
			     mark messages are not generated.

	   dup_delay	     Sets the maximum time before writing a ``last
			     message repeated <N> times'' message in a log
			     file when duplicate messages have been detected.
			     The default is 30 seconds.

	   utmp_ttl	     Sets the time-to-live for messages used by the
			     utmp, wtmp, and lastlog subsystems.  The default
			     is 31622400 seconds (approximately 1 year).

	   mps_limit	     Sets the per-process message per second quota.
			     The default is value is 500.  A value of 0 dis-
			     ables the quota mechanism.

	   max_file_size     Sets the maximum file size for individual files
			     in the ASL data store.  The default is 25600000
			     bytes.

QUERY-ACTION RULES
     Rules contain three components: a query; an action; and optionally,
     parameters specific to that action.  For example:

	   ? [= Sender foobar] [<= Level error] notify com.apple.foobar

   Query Format
     Queries comprise one or more message matching components, each of which
     has the form:

	   [OP KEY VAL]

     OP is a comparison operator.  It can have the following values:

	   T	 true (always matches)
	   =	 equal
	   !	 not equal
	   >	 greater than
	   >=	 greater than or equal to
	   <	 less than
	   <=	 less than or equal to

     It can also be preceded by one or more modifiers:

	   C	 casefold
	   N	 numeric comparison
	   S	 substring
	   A	 prefix
	   Z	 suffix

     KEY and VAL are message keys and values.  For example

	   [= Sender foobar]

     matches any message with value ``foobar'' for the ``Sender'' key.	The
     query

	   [CA= Color gr]

     matches any message with a value beginning with the letters GR, Gr, gr,
     or gR (C meaning casefold, A meaning prefix) for the ``Color'' key.  The
     example query above,

	   [= Sender foobar] [N< Level 3]

     matches any message from ``foobar'' with a level numerically less than 3
     (string values are converted to integers, and the comparison is done on
     the integer values).  Note that the string values may be used equiva-
     lently for the Level key, so the example above may also be written as:

	   [= Sender foobar] [< Level Error]

     String values for levels may be any of the set ``emergency'', ``alert'',
     ``critical'', ``error'', ``warning'', ``notice'', ``info, or'' ``debug''.
     These strings may be upper, lower, or mixed case.

     The ``T'' operator is useful to test for the presence of a particular
     key.

	   [T Flavor]

     Will match any message that has a ``Flavor'' key, regardless of its
     value.

   Actions
     The following actions are available.

	   notify	    Causes syslogd to post a notification with
			    notify_post().  The notification key must appear
			    as a single parameter following the ``notify''
			    action.

	   access	    Sets read access controls for messages that match
			    the associated query pattern.  syslogd will
			    restrict read access to matching messages to a
			    specific user and group.  The user ID number and
			    group ID number must follow the ``access'' keyword
			    as parameters.

	   store	    Causes syslogd to save matching messages, either
			    in the main ASL data store, or in a separate log
			    message data store file is a file name is given as
			    a parameter.  A separate data store file may be
			    accessed using the syslog command line utility.  A
			    new file will be created if one does not exist.
			    If a new file is being created, the UID, GID, and
			    mode of the file may be specified using the
			    options ``uid=UUU'', ``gid=GGG'', and
			    ``mode=MMMM'', where UUU and GGG are a user ID and
			    group ID, and MMMM is a mode specification of the
			    form ``0644'' with a leading zero for an octal
			    number or DDD for a decimal number.

			    Two other optional parameters may also follow the
			    pathname.

			    If a separate log message data store file is spec-
			    ified as a parameter, then syslogd will open the
			    database, save a matching message, and then close
			    the database.  If a high volume of messages is
			    expected, specifying the ``stayopen'' option will
			    improve performance.

			    Also, if a separate log message data store file is
			    specified as a parameter, matching messages will
			    be excluded from all further processing.  Adding
			    the ``continue'' option will cause syslogd to save
			    matching messages in the specified store file and
			    then continue processing matching messages in
			    accordance with the actions specified in
			    /etc/asl.conf and /etc/syslog.conf.

			    Note that if the asl.conf configuration file con-
			    tains no matching rules for the main ASL data
			    store, then syslogd will save all messages.

	   store_directory  Causes matching messages to be stored in a log
			    message data store file in a separate directory.
			    The directory path name must follow as the first
			    parameter.	The named directory must exist.
			    syslogd will not create the directory path.

			    Messages saved to a store directory are saved in
			    files that are named ``yyyy.mm.dd.asl'', where
			    ``yyyy'', ``mm'', and ``dd'' are the year, month
			    (01 to 12) and day of the month (01 to 31) associ-
			    ated with matching messages.  This has the effect
			    of saving messages in a separate file for each
			    day.

			    The ``uid=UUU'', ``gid=GGG'', ``mode=MMMM'', and
			    ``continue'' options available for the ``store''
			    action may also be specified for a store direc-
			    tory.  The uid, gid, and mode specification will
			    be used when the individual daily store files are
			    created.

	   file 	    Causes matching messages to be stored in a log
			    file.  The file's path name must follow as the
			    first parameter.  The file's directory must exist.
			    If the path already exists, it must be a plain
			    file.  Otherwise syslogd will create the file.
			    The file's owner will be root, and the file's
			    group will be admin.  A file mode may be specified
			    as an option of the form ``mode=MMMM'' as
			    described above.  One or more UIDs may be given as
			    the values of options of the form ``uid=UUU''.
			    One or more GIDs may be given as the values of
			    options of the form ``gid=GGG''.  If any UIDs or
			    GIDs are provided, the specified users and groups
			    will be given read access to the file.  Note that
			    UIDs and GIDs should be defined in the local Open
			    Directory database, since syslogd starts and may
			    create the log file before network directory ser-
			    vices are available.  Unknown UIDs and GIDs will
			    be ignored when setting access controls.

			    By default, log files will be written using the
			    same format used for printing by syslog when the
			    -F std flag is supplied.  A print format may be
			    specified as the value of the ``format=FMT''
			    option.  The default is ``format=std''.  Alternate
			    file formats, including ``bsd'' and ``raw'' are
			    supported.	Custom formats may be specified as
			    well, using the syntax supported by syslog -F.
			    Space and tab character in a custom format string
			    must be escaped with a leading backslash charac-
			    ter.  Custom format strings may include variables
			    of the form ``$Name'' ``$(Name)'' or
			    ``$((Name)(fmt))''.  which will be expanded to the
			    associated with the named key.  The first form may
			    be used in most cases.  The second form may be
			    used if the variable is not delimited by white-
			    space.  The third form permits the selection of
			    alternate output formats for certain keys, such as
			    Time and Level.  See syslog(1) for details.

			    For example, the option:

				  format=$((Time)(Z)) $Host $(Sender)[$(PID)] <$((Level)(str))>: $Message

			    produces output similar to the ``std'' format, but
			    using the UTC (Zulu) timezone.

			    By default, files printed using the ``bsd'' and
			    ``std'' formats will suppress printing duplicates.
			    If two or more messages are logged within 30 sec-
			    onds, and which differ only in time, then the sec-
			    ond and subsequent messages will not be printed.
			    When a different message is logged, or 30 seconds
			    have elapsed since the initial message was logged,
			    a line with the text
				  --- last message repeated N times ---
			    will be added to the file.	The default may be
			    disabled using the ``no_dup_supress'' option.

	   broadcast	    Causes syslogd to write the text of matching mes-
			    sages to all terminal windows.  If optional text
			    follows the ``broadcast'' keyword, then that text
			    is written rather that the matching message text.

	   ignore	    Causes a matching message to be ignored in all
			    subsequent matching rules.

ASLMANAGER PARAMETER SETTINGS
     The following parameter-settings are recognized by aslmanager.

	   aslmanager_debug  Enables or disables internal debugging output.
			     This is probably of little interest to most
			     users.  The debug parameter requires a value of
			     ``1'' to enable debug output, or a value of ``0''
			     to disable it.  Debug messages are sent to
			     syslogd.

	   store_ttl	     Sets the time-to-live in days for messages in the
			     syslog data store.  The default is 7 days.

	   max_store_size    Sets the maximum size for for the ASL data store.
			     The default is 150000000 bytes.

	   archive	     Enables or disables archiving.  The archive
			     parameter requires a value of ``1'' to enable ar-
			     chiving, or a value of ``0'' to disable it.  An
			     option archive directory path may follow the
			     ``0'' or ``1''.  If enabled, files removed from
			     the ASL data store are moved to the archive
			     directory.  The default archive directory path is
			     /var/log/asl.archive.

	   store_path	     The data store path used by aslmanager.  The
			     default is /var/log/asl.  Note that this parame-
			     ter is ignored by syslogd.
	   archive_mode      Files copied to the archive will be given the
			     specified access mode.  The default is 0400, so
			     archive files will only be readable by root.
