NAME
       Mail::SPF::Server - Server class for processing SPF requests

SYNOPSIS
	   use Mail::SPF;

	   my $spf_server  = Mail::SPF::Server->new(
	       # Optional custom default for authority explanation:
	       default_authority_explanation =>
		   'See http://www.%{d}/why/id=%{S};ip=%{I};r=%{R}'
	   );

	   my $result	   = $spf_server->process($request);

DESCRIPTION
       Mail::SPF::Server is a server class for processing SPF requests.  Each
       server instance can be configured with specific processing parameters.
       Also, the default Net::DNS::Resolver DNS resolver used for making DNS
       look-ups can be overridden with a custom resolver object.

   Constructor
       The following constructor is provided:

       new(%options): returns Mail::SPF::Server
	   Creates a new server object for processing SPF requests.

	   %options is a list of key/value pairs representing any of the
	   following options:

	   default_authority_explanation
	       A string denoting the default (not macro-expanded) authority
	       explanation string to use if the authority domain does not
	       specify an explanation string of its own.  Defaults to:

		   'Please see http://www.openspf.org/Why?s=%{_scope};id=%{S};ip=%{C};r=%{R}'

	       As can be seen from the default, a non-standard "_scope" pseudo
	       macro is supported that expands to the name of the identity's
	       scope.  (Note: Do not use any non-standard macros in
	       explanation strings published in DNS.)

	   hostname
	       A string denoting the local system's fully qualified host name
	       that should be used for expanding the "r" macro in explanation
	       strings.  Defaults to the system's configured host name.

	   dns_resolver
	       An optional DNS resolver object.  If none is specified, a new
	       Net::DNS::Resolver object is used.  The resolver object may be
	       of a different class, but it must provide an interface similar
	       to Net::DNS::Resolver -- at least the "send" and "errorstring"
	       methods must be supported, and the "send" method must return
	       either an object of class Net::DNS::Packet, or, in the case of
	       an error, undef.

	   query_rr_types
	       For which RR types to query when looking up and selecting SPF
	       records.  The following values are supported:

	       Mail::SPF::Server->query_rr_type_all (default)
		   Both "SPF" and "TXT" type RRs.

	       Mail::SPF::Server->query_rr_type_spf
		   "SPF" type RRs only.

	       Mail::SPF::Server->query_rr_type_txt
		   "TXT" type RRs only.

	       Some (few) name servers suffer from serious brain damage with
	       regard to the handling of queries for RR types that are unknown
	       to them, such as the "SPF" RR type, so some (few) Mail::SPF
	       users have expressed the desire for a way to disable the
	       retrieval of "SPF" type RRs.  It is, however, a better idea to
	       pressure the manufacturers of such broken name servers into
	       fixing their products.

	       See RFC 4408, 3.1.1, for a discussion of the topic, as well as
	       the description of the "select_record" method.

	   max_dns_interactive_terms
	       An integer denoting the maximum number of terms (mechanisms and
	       modifiers) per SPF check that perform DNS look-ups, as defined
	       in RFC 4408, 10.1, paragraph 6.	If undef is specified, there
	       is no limit on the number of such terms.  Defaults to 10, which
	       is the value defined in RFC 4408.

	       A value above the default is strongly discouraged for security
	       reasons.  A value below the default has implications with
	       regard to the predictability of SPF results.  Only deviate from
	       the default if you know what you are doing!

	   max_name_lookups_per_term
	       An integer denoting the maximum number of DNS name look-ups per
	       term (mechanism or modifier), as defined in RFC 4408, 10.1,
	       paragraph 7.  If undef is specified, there is no limit on the
	       number of look-ups performed.  Defaults to 10, which is the
	       value defined in RFC 4408.

	       A value above the default is strongly discouraged for security
	       reasons.  A value below the default has implications with
	       regard to the predictability of SPF results.  Only deviate from
	       the default if you know what you are doing!

	   max_name_lookups_per_mx_mech
	   max_name_lookups_per_ptr_mech
	       An integer denoting the maximum number of DNS name look-ups per
	       mx or ptr mechanism, respectively.  Defaults to the value of
	       the "max_name_lookups_per_term" option.	See there for
	       additional information and security notes.

	   max_void_dns_lookups
	       An integer denoting the maximum number of "void" DNS look-ups
	       per SPF check, i.e. the number of DNS look-ups that were caused
	       by DNS-interactive terms and macros (as defined in RFC 4408,
	       10.1, paragraphs 6 and 7) and that are allowed to return an
	       empty answer with RCODE 0 or RCODE 3 ("NXDOMAIN") before
	       processing is aborted with a "permerror" result.  If undef is
	       specified, there is no stricter limit on the number of void DNS
	       look-ups beyond the usual processing limits.  Defaults to 2.

	       Specifically, the DNS look-ups that are subject to this limit
	       are those caused by the "a", "mx", "ptr", and "exists"
	       mechanisms and the "p" macro.

	       A value of 2 is likely to prevent effective DoS attacks against
	       third-party victim domains.  However, a definite limit may
	       cause "permerror" results even with certain (overly complex)
	       innocent sender policies where useful results would normally be
	       returned.

   Class methods
       The following class methods are provided:

       result_class: returns class
       result_class($name): returns class
	   Returns a Mail::SPF::Result descendent class determined from the
	   given result name via the server's inherent result base class, or
	   returns the server's inherent result base class if no result name
	   is given.  This method may also be used as an instance method.

	   Note:  Do not write code invoking class methods on literal result
	   class names as this would ignore any derivative result classes
	   provided by Mail::SPF extension modules.

       throw_result($name, $request): throws Mail::SPF::Result
       throw_result($name, $request, $text): throws Mail::SPF::Result
	   Throws a Mail::SPF::Result descendant determined from the given
	   result name via the server's inherent result base class, passing an
	   optional result text and associating the given Mail::SPF::Request
	   object with the result object.  This method may also be used as an
	   instance method.

	   Note:  Do not write code invoking "throw" on literal result class
	   names as this would ignore any derivative result classes provided
	   by Mail::SPF extension modules.

   Instance methods
       The following instance methods are provided:

       process($request): returns Mail::SPF::Result
	   Processes the given Mail::SPF::Request object, queries the
	   authoritative domain for an SPF sender policy (see the description
	   of the "select_record" method), evaluates the policy with regard to
	   the given identity and other request parameters, and returns a
	   Mail::SPF::Result object denoting the result of the policy
	   evaluation.	See RFC 4408, 4, and RFC 4406, 4, for details.

       select_record($request): returns Mail::SPF::Record; throws
       Mail::SPF::EDNSError, Mail::SPF::ENoAcceptableRecord,
       Mail::SPF::ERedundantAcceptableRecords, Mail::SPF::ESyntaxError
	   Queries the authority domain of the given Mail::SPF::Request object
	   for SPF sender policy records and, if multiple records are
	   available, selects the record of the highest acceptable record
	   version that covers the requested scope.

	   More precisely, the following algorithm is performed:

	   1.  Determine the authority domain, the set of acceptable SPF
	       record versions, and the identity scope from the given request
	       object.

	   2.  Query the authority domain for SPF records of the "SPF" DNS RR
	       type, discarding any records that are of an inacceptable
	       version or do not cover the desired scope.

	       If this yields no SPF records, query the authority domain for
	       SPF records of the "TXT" DNS RR type, discarding any records
	       that are of an inacceptable version or do not cover the desired
	       scope.

	       If still no acceptable SPF records could be found, throw a
	       Mail::SPF::ENoAcceptableRecord exception.

	   3.  Discard all records but those of the highest acceptable version
	       found.

	       If exactly one record remains, return it.  Otherwise, throw a
	       Mail::SPF::ERedundantAcceptableRecords exception.

	   If the querying of either RR type has been disabled via the "new"
	   constructor's "query_rr_types" option, the respective part in step
	   2 will be skipped.

	   Mail::SPF::EDNSError exceptions due to DNS look-ups and
	   Mail::SPF::ESyntaxError exceptions due to invalid acceptable
	   records may also be thrown.

       get_acceptable_records_from_packet($packet, $rr_type, \@versions,
       $scope, $domain): returns list of Mail::SPF::Record
	   Filters from the given Net::DNS::Packet object all resource records
	   of the given RR type and for the given domain name, discarding any
	   records that are not SPF records at all, that are of an
	   inacceptable SPF record version, or that do not cover the given
	   scope.  Returns a list of acceptable records.

       dns_lookup($domain, $rr_type): returns Net::DNS::Packet; throws
       Mail::SPF::EDNSTimeout, Mail::SPF::EDNSError
	   Queries the DNS using the configured resolver for resource records
	   of the desired type at the specified domain and returns a
	   Net::DNS::Packet object if an answer packet was received.  Throws a
	   Mail::SPF::EDNSTimeout exception if a DNS time-out occurred.
	   Throws a Mail::SPF::EDNSError exception if an error (other than
	   RCODE 3 AKA "NXDOMAIN") occurred.

       count_dns_interactive_term($request): throws
       Mail::SPF::EProcessingLimitExceeded
	   Increments by one the count of DNS-interactive mechanisms and
	   modifiers that have been processed so far during the evaluation of
	   the given Mail::SPF::Request object.  If this exceeds the
	   configured limit (see the "new" constructor's
	   "max_dns_interactive_terms" option), throws a
	   Mail::SPF::EProcessingLimitExceeded exception.

	   This method is supposed to be called by the "match" and "process"
	   methods of Mail::SPF::Mech and Mail::SPF::Mod sub-classes before
	   (and only if) they do any DNS look-ups.

       count_void_dns_lookup($request): throws
       Mail::SPF::EProcessingLimitExceeded
	   Increments by one the count of "void" DNS look-ups that have
	   occurred so far during the evaluation of the given
	   Mail::SPF::Request object.  If this exceeds the configured limit
	   (see the "new" constructor's "max_void_dns_lookups" option), throws
	   a Mail::SPF::EProcessingLimitExceeded exception.

	   This method is supposed to be called by any code after any calls to
	   the "dns_lookup" method whenever (i) no answer records were
	   returned, and (ii) this fact is a possible indication of a DoS
	   attack against a third-party victim domain, and (iii) the number of
	   "void" look-ups is not already constrained otherwise (as for
	   example is the case with the "include" mechanism and the "redirect"
	   modifier).  Specifically, this applies to look-ups performed by the
	   "a", "mx", "ptr", and "exists" mechanisms and the "p" macro.

       default_authority_explanation: returns Mail::SPF::MacroString
	   Returns the default authority explanation as a MacroString object.
	   See the description of the "new" constructor's
	   "default_authority_explanation" option.

       hostname: returns string
	   Returns the local system's host name.  See the description of the
	   "new" constructor's "hostname" option.

       dns_resolver: returns Net::DNS::Resolver or compatible object
	   Returns the DNS resolver object of the server object.  See the
	   description of the "new" constructor's "dns_resolver" option.

       query_rr_types: returns integer
	   Returns a value denoting the RR types for which to query when
	   looking up and selecting SPF records.  See the description of the
	   "new" constructor's "query_rr_types" option.

       max_dns_interactive_terms: returns integer
       max_name_lookups_per_term: returns integer
       max_name_lookups_per_mx_mech: returns integer
       max_name_lookups_per_ptr_mech: returns integer
       max_void_dns_lookups: returns integer
	   Return the limit values of the server object.  See the description
	   of the "new" constructor's corresponding options.
