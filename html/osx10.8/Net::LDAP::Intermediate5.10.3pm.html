NAME
       Net::LDAP::Intermediate - LDAPv3 intermediate response object base
       class

SYNOPSIS
	use Net::LDAP::Intermediate;

DESCRIPTION
       "Net::LDAP::Intermediate" is a base-class for LDAPv3 intermediate
       response objects.

CONSTRUCTORS
       new ( ARGS )
	   ARGS is a list of name/value pairs, valid arguments are:

	   responseName
	       A dotted-decimal representation of an OBJECT IDENTIFIER which
	       uniquely identifies the intermediate response. This prevents
	       conflicts between intermediate response names.

	   responseValue
	       Optional information associated with the intermediate response.
	       It's format is specific to the particular intermediate
	       response.

       from_asn ( ASN )
	   ASN is a HASH reference, normally extracted from a PDU. It will
	   contain a "responseName" element and optionally "responseValue"
	   element. On return ASN will be blessed into a package. If
	   "responseName" is a registered OID, then ASN will be blessed into
	   the registered package, if not then ASN will be blessed into
	   Net::LDAP::Intermediate.

	   This constructor is used internally by Net::LDAP and assumes that
	   HASH passed contains a valid intermediate response. It should be
	   used with caution.

METHODS
       In addition to the methods listed below, each of the named parameters
       to "new" is also avaliable as a method. "responseName" will return the
       OID of the intermediate response object. "responseValue" is set/get
       methods and will return the current value for each attribute if called
       without arguments, but may also be called with arguments to set new
       values.

       error ()
	   If there has been an error returns a description of the error,
	   otherwise it will return "undef"

       init ()
	   "init" will be called as the last step in both contructors. What it
	   does will depend on the sub-class. It must always return the
	   object.

       register ( OID )
	   "register" is provided for sub-class implementors. It should be
	   called as a class method on a sub-class of Net::LDAP::Intermediate
	   with the OID that the class will handle. Net::LDAP::Intermediate
	   will remember this class and OID pair and use it in the following
	   situations.

	   o   "new" is called as a class method on the
	       Net::LDAP::Intermediate package and OID is passed as the
	       responseName. The returned object will be blessed into the
	       package that registered the OID.

	   o   "new" is called as a class method on a registered package and
	       the "responseName" is not specified. The "responseName" will be
	       set to the OID registered by that package.

	   o   "from_asn" is called to construct an object from ASN. The
	       returned object will be blessed into the package which was
	       registered to handle the OID in the ASN.

       ( to_asn )
	   Returns a structure suitable for passing to Convert::ASN1 for
	   encoding. This method will be called by Net::LDAP when the
	   intermediate response is used.

	   The base class implementation of this method will call the
	   "responseValue" method without arguments to allow a sub-class to
	   encode it's value. Sub-classes should not need to override this
	   method.

       valid ()
	   Returns true if the object is valid and can be encoded. The default
	   implementation for this method is to return TRUE if there is no
	   error, but sub-classes may override that.
