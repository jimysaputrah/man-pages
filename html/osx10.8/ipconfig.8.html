DESCRIPTION
     ipconfig is a utility that communicates with the IPConfiguration agent to
     retrieve and set IP configuration parameters.  It should only be used in
     a test and debug context.	Using it for any other purpose is strongly
     discouraged.  Public API's in the SystemConfiguration framework are cur-
     rently the only supported way to access and control the state of IPCon-
     figuration.

     The IPConfiguration agent is responsible for configuring and managing the
     IP addresses on direct, connectionless interfaces such as IEEE 802.3 Eth-
     ernet and IEEE 1394 FireWire.  The IPConfiguration agent is a program
     bundle that is loaded and executed by the configd(8) process.

     The IPConfiguration agent implements the client side of the DHCP and
     BOOTP protocols described in RFC951, RFC1542, RFC2131, and RFC2132.  It
     also assigns and maintains static IP addresses.  It may also allocate and
     assign a link-local IP address if DHCP fails to acquire an IP address.

     In all cases, the IPConfiguration agent performs IP address conflict
     detection before assigning an IP address to an interface.

COMMANDS
     The ipconfig utility provides several commands:

     waitall	 Blocks until all network services have completed configuring,
		 or have timed out in the process of configuring.  This is
		 only useful for initial system start-up time synchronization
		 for legacy network services that are incapable of dealing
		 with dynamic network configuration changes.

     getifaddr interface-name
		 Prints to standard output the IP address for the first net-
		 work service associated with the given interface.  The output
		 will be empty if no service is currently configured or active
		 on the interface.

     ifcount	 Prints the number of interfaces that IPConfiguration is capa-
		 ble of configuring.  The value that's printed will not change
		 unless relevant network interfaces are either added to or
		 removed from the system.

     getoption interface-name (option-name | option-code)
		 Prints the BOOTP/DHCP option with the given name or option
		 code integer value.  See bootpd(8) for option code names.  If
		 an option has multiple values e.g. domain_name_server, only
		 the first value is printed.

     getpacket interface-name
		 Prints to standard output the DHCP/BOOTP packet that the
		 client accepted from the DHCP/BOOTP server.  This command is
		 useful to check what the server provided, and whether the
		 values are sensible.  This command outputs nothing if
		 DHCP/BOOTP is not active on the interface, or the attempt to
		 acquire an IP address was unsuccessful.

     getv6packet interface-name
		 Prints to standard output the latest DHCPv6 packet that the
		 client accepted from the DHCPv6 server.  In the case of
		 stateful DHCPv6, it corresponds to the last packet from the
		 server that contained addressing information.	This command
		 is useful to check what the server provided, and whether the
		 values are sensible.  This command outputs nothing if DHCPv6
		 is not active on the interface.

     set interface-name NONE
     set interface-name (DHCP | BOOTP)
     set interface-name (MANUAL | INFORM) ip-address subnet-mask
     set interface-name NONE-V6
     set interface-name AUTOMATIC-V6
     set interface-name MANUAL-V6 ipv6-address prefix-length
     set interface-name 6TO4
		 Sets the interface to have a new temporary network service of
		 the given type.  Any existing services on the interface for
		 the particular protocol (IPv4 or IPv6) are first de-config-
		 ured before the new service is instantiated.

		 If NONE is specified, all existing IPv4 services are de-con-
		 figured.  If NONE-V6 is specified, all existing IPv6 services
		 are de-configured.

		 DHCP and BOOTP require no additional arguments. The IP
		 address, subnet mask, router, and DNS information are
		 retrieved automatically.

		 Both MANUAL and INFORM require the specification of an IP
		 address ip-address and a subnet mask subnet-mask.

		 The INFORM service configures the IP address statically like
		 MANUAL, but then broadcasts DHCP INFORM packets to retrieve
		 DHCP option information. If the DHCP server responds and sup-
		 plies a subnet mask, that subnet mask is used instead of the
		 specified subnet-mask.

		 AUTOMATIC-V6 requires no additional arguments.  The IPv6
		 address, prefix length and router are retrieved automati-
		 cally.

		 MANUAL-V6 requires the specification of the IPv6 address
		 ipv6-address and a prefix length prefix-length.

		 6TO4 only works on Six To Four (IFT_STF) interfaces e.g.
		 stf0.	If it is specified on a non-IFT_STF interface, it has
		 the same effect as specifying NONE-V6.

		 The set command requires root privileges.

		 Note: The set command is very useful for debugging, but it
		 can't be used to configure a persistent service.  The tempo-
		 rary services that are created only remain until the next
		 network configuration change occurs. See scselect(8).

     setverbose level
		 Sets verbose mode logging in the IPConfiguration agent. Spec-
		 ify a level value of 0 to disable verbose logging, the
		 default.  Specify a value of 1 to enable verbose logging.

		 When enabled, useful debugging information is logged using
		 syslog(3) with level LOG_NOTICE.  In addition, the packet
		 trace file /var/log/com.apple.IPConfiguration.bootp is opened
		 and BOOTP/DHCP packets that are sent and received are printed
		 to the file.

		 The setverbose command requires root privileges.

     # ipconfig getpacket en0
     op = BOOTREPLY
     htype = 1
     dp_flags = 0
     hlen = 6
     hops = 0

     yiaddr = 192.168.4.10
     siaddr = 192.168.4.1
     giaddr = 0.0.0.0
     chaddr = 0:3:93:7a:d7:5c
     sname = dhcp.mycompany.net
     file =
     options:
     Options count is 10
     dhcp_message_type (uint8): ACK 0x5
     server_identifier (ip): 192.168.4.1
     lease_time (uint32): 0x164a
     subnet_mask (ip): 255.255.255.0
     router (ip_mult): {192.168.4.1}
     domain_name_server (ip_mult): {192.168.4.1}
     domain_name (string): mycompany.net
     end (none):

     # ipconfig getoption en0 router
