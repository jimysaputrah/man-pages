DESCRIPTION
       This document is about using Pod::Simple to write a Pod processor,
       generally a Pod formatter. If you just want to know about using an
       existing Pod formatter, instead see its documentation and see also the
       docs in Pod::Simple.

       The zeroeth step in writing a Pod formatter is to make sure that there
       isn't already a decent one in CPAN. See &lthttp://search.cpan.org/&gt, and
       run a search on the name of the format you want to render to. Also
       consider joining the Pod People list
       &lthttp://lists.perl.org/showlist.cgi?name=pod-people&gt and asking whether
       anyone has a formatter for that format -- maybe someone cobbled one
       together but just hasn't released it.

       The first step in writing a Pod processor is to read perlpodspec, which
       contains notes information on writing a Pod parser (which has been
       largely taken care of by Pod::Simple), but also a lot of requirements
       and recommendations for writing a formatter.

       The second step is to actually learn the format you're planning to
       format to -- or at least as much as you need to know to represent Pod,
       which probably isn't much.

       The third step is to pick which of Pod::Simple's interfaces you want to
       use -- the basic interface via Pod::Simple or Pod::Simple::Methody is
       event-based, sort of like HTML::Parser's interface, or sort of like
       XML::Parser's "Handlers" interface), but Pod::Simple::PullParser
       provides a token-stream interface, sort of like HTML::TokeParser's
       interface; Pod::Simple::SimpleTree provides a simple tree interface,
       rather like XML::Parser's "Tree" interface. Users familiar with XML-
       handling will find one of these styles relatively familiar; but if you
       would be even more at home with XML, there are classes that produce an
       XML representation of the Pod stream, notably
       Pod::Simple::XMLOutStream; you can feed the output of such a class to
       whatever XML parsing system you are most at home with.

       The last step is to write your code based on how the events (or tokens,
       or tree-nodes, or the XML, or however you're parsing) will map to
       constructs in the output format. Also sure to consider how to escape
       text nodes containing arbitrary text, and also what to do with text
       nodes that represent preformatted text (from verbatim sections).

Events
       TODO intro... mention that events are supplied for implicits, like for
       missing &gt's

       In the following section, we use XML to represent the event structure
       associated with a particular construct.	That is, TODO

       "$parser-&gt_handle_element_start( element_name, attr_hashref )"
       "$parser-&gt_handle_element_end( element_name  )"
       "$parser-&gt_handle_text(	text_string  )"

       TODO describe

       events with an element_name of Document
	   Parsing a document produces this event structure:

	     &ltDocument start_line="543"&gt
	       ...all events...
	     &lt/Document&gt

	   The value of the start_line attribute will be the line number of
	   the first Pod directive in the document.

	   If there is no Pod in the given document, then the event structure
	   will be this:

	     &ltDocument contentless="1" start_line="543"&gt
	     &lt/Document&gt

	   In that case, the value of the start_line attribute will not be
	   meaningful; under current implementations, it will probably be the
	   line number of the last line in the file.

       events with an element_name of Para
	   Parsing a plain (non-verbatim, non-directive, non-data) paragraph
	   in a Pod document produces this event structure:

	       &ltPara start_line="543"&gt
		 ...all events in this paragraph...
	       &lt/Para&gt

	   The value of the start_line attribute will be the line number of
	   the start of the paragraph.

	   For example, parsing this paragraph of Pod:

	     The value of the I&ltstart_line&gt attribute will be the
	     line number of the start of the paragraph.

	   produces this event structure:

	       &ltPara start_line="129"&gt
		 The value of the
		 &ltI&gt
		   start_line
		 &lt/I&gt
		  attribute will be the line number of the first Pod directive
		 in the document.
	       &lt/Para&gt

       events with an element_name of B, C, F, or I.
	   Parsing a B&lt...&gt formatting code (or of course any of its
	   semantically identical syntactic variants B&lt&lt ... &gt&gt, or
	   B&lt&lt&lt&lt ... &gt&gt&gt&gt, etc.)  produces this event structure:

		 &ltB&gt
		   ...stuff...
		 &lt/B&gt

	   Currently, there are no attributes conveyed.

	   Parsing C, F, or I codes produce the same structure, with only a
	   different element name.

	   If your parser object has been set to accept other formatting
	   codes, then they will be presented like these B/C/F/I codes --
	   i.e., without any attributes.

       events with an element_name of S
	   Normally, parsing an S&lt...&gt sequence produces this event structure,
	   just as if it were a B/C/F/I code:

		 &ltS&gt
		   ...stuff...
		 &lt/S&gt

	   However, Pod::Simple (and presumably all derived parsers) offers
	   the "nbsp_for_S" option which, if enabled, will suppress all S
	   events, and instead change all spaces in the content to non-
	   breaking spaces. This is intended for formatters that output to a
	   format that has no code that means the same as S&lt...&gt, but which
	   has a code/character that means non-breaking space.

       events with an element_name of X
	   Normally, parsing an X&lt...&gt sequence produces this event structure,
	   just as if it were a B/C/F/I code:

		 &ltX&gt
		   ...stuff...
		 &lt/X&gt

	   However, Pod::Simple (and presumably all derived parsers) offers
	   the "nix_X_codes" option which, if enabled, will suppress all X
	   events and ignore their content.  For formatters/processors that
	   don't use X events, this is presumably quite useful.

       events with an element_name of L
	   Because the L&lt...&gt is the most complex construct in the language,
	   it should not surprise you that the events it generates are the
	   most complex in the language. Most of complexity is hidden away in
	   the attribute values, so for those of you writing a Pod formatter
	   that produces a non-hypertextual format, you can just ignore the
	   attributes and treat an L event structure like a formatting element
	   that (presumably) doesn't actually produce a change in formatting.
	   That is, the content of the L event structure (as opposed to its
	   attributes) is always what text should be displayed.

	   There are, at first glance, three kinds of L links: URL, man, and
	   pod.

	   When a L&ltsome_url&gt code is parsed, it produces this event
	   structure:

	     &ltL content-implicit="yes" to="that_url" type="url"&gt
	       that_url
	     &lt/L&gt

	   The "type="url"" attribute is always specified for this type of L
	   code.

	   For example, this Pod source:

	     L&lthttp://www.perl.com/CPAN/authors/&gt

	   produces this event structure:

	     &ltL content-implicit="yes" to="http://www.perl.com/CPAN/authors/" type="url"&gt
	       http://www.perl.com/CPAN/authors/
	     &lt/L&gt

	   When a L&ltmanpage(section)&gt code is parsed (and these are fairly
	   rare and not terribly useful), it produces this event structure:

	     &ltL content-implicit="yes" to="manpage(section)" type="man"&gt
	       manpage(section)
	     &lt/L&gt

	   The "type="man"" attribute is always specified for this type of L
	   code.

	   For example, this Pod source:

	     L&ltcrontab(5)&gt

	   produces this event structure:

	     &ltL content-implicit="yes" to="crontab(5)" type="man"&gt
	       crontab(5)
	     &lt/L&gt

	   In the rare cases where a man page link has a specified, that text
	   appears in a section attribute. For example, this Pod source:

	     L&ltcrontab(5)/"ENVIRONMENT"&gt

	   will produce this event structure:

	     &ltL content-implicit="yes" section="ENVIRONMENT" to="crontab(5)" type="man"&gt
	       "ENVIRONMENT" in crontab(5)
	     &lt/L&gt

	   In the rare case where the Pod document has code like
	   L&ltsometext|manpage(section)&gt, then the sometext will appear as the
	   content of the element, the manpage(section) text will appear only
	   as the value of the to attribute, and there will be no
	   "content-implicit="yes"" attribute (whose presence means that the
	   Pod parser had to infer what text should appear as the link text --
	   as opposed to cases where that attribute is absent, which means
	   that the Pod parser did not have to infer the link text, because
	   that L code explicitly specified some link text.)

	   For example, this Pod source:

	     L&lthell itself!|crontab(5)&gt

	   will produce this event structure:

	     &ltL to="crontab(5)" type="man"&gt
	       hell itself!
	     &lt/L&gt

	   The last type of L structure is for links to/within Pod documents.
	   It is the most complex because it can have a to attribute, or a
	   section attribute, or both. The "type="pod"" attribute is always
	   specified for this type of L code.

	   In the most common case, the simple case of a L&ltpodpage&gt code
	   produces this event structure:

	     &ltL content-implicit="yes" to="Net::Ping" type="pod"&gt
	       podpage
	     &lt/L&gt

	   For example, this Pod source:

	     L&ltNet::Ping&gt

	   produces this event structure:

	     &ltL content-implicit="yes" to="Net::Ping" type="pod"&gt
	       Net::Ping
	     &lt/L&gt

	   In cases where there is link-text explicitly specified, it is to be
	   found in the content of the element (and not the attributes), just
	   as with the L&ltsometext|manpage(section)&gt case discussed above.  For
	   example, this Pod source:

	     L&ltPerl Error Messages|perldiag&gt

	   produces this event structure:

	     &ltL to="perldiag" type="pod"&gt
	       Perl Error Messages
	     &lt/L&gt

	   In cases of links to a section in the current Pod document, there
	   is a section attribute instead of a to attribute.  For example,
	   this Pod source:

	     L&lt/"Member Data"&gt

	   produces this event structure:

	     &ltL content-implicit="yes" section="Member Data" type="pod"&gt
	       "Member Data"
	     &lt/L&gt

	   As another example, this Pod source:

	     L&ltthe various attributes|/"Member Data"&gt

	   produces this event structure:

	     &ltL section="Member Data" type="pod"&gt
	       the various attributes
	     &lt/L&gt

	   In cases of links to a section in a different Pod document, there
	   are both a section attribute and a to attribute.  For example, this
	   Pod source:

	     L&ltperlsyn/"Basic BLOCKs and Switch Statements"&gt

	   produces this event structure:

	     &ltL content-implicit="yes" section="Basic BLOCKs and Switch Statements" to="perlsyn" type="pod"&gt
	       "Basic BLOCKs and Switch Statements" in perlsyn
	     &lt/L&gt

	   As another example, this Pod source:

	     L&ltSWITCH statements|perlsyn/"Basic BLOCKs and Switch Statements"&gt

	   produces this event structure:

	     &ltL section="Basic BLOCKs and Switch Statements" to="perlsyn" type="pod"&gt
	       SWITCH statements
	     &lt/L&gt

	   Incidentally, note that we do not distinguish between these
	   syntaxes:

	     L&lt/"Member Data"&gt
	     L&lt"Member Data"&gt
	     L&lt/Member Data&gt
	     L&ltMember Data&gt    [deprecated syntax]

	   That is, they all produce the same event structure, namely:

	     &ltL content-implicit="yes" section="Member Data" type="pod"&gt
	       &#34;Member Data&#34;
	     &lt/L&gt

       events with an element_name of E or Z
	   While there are Pod codes E&lt...&gt and Z&lt&gt, these do not produce any
	   E or Z events -- that is, there are no such events as E or Z.

       events with an element_name of Verbatim
	   When a Pod verbatim paragraph (AKA "codeblock") is parsed, it
	   produces this event structure:

	     &ltVerbatim start_line="543" xml:space="preserve"&gt
	       ...text...
	     &lt/Verbatim&gt

	   The value of the start_line attribute will be the line number of
	   the first line of this verbatim block.  The xml:space attribute is
	   always present, and always has the value "preserve".

	   The text content will have tabs already expanded.

       events with an element_name of head1 .. head4
	   When a "=head1 ..." directive is parsed, it produces this event
	   structure:

	     &lthead1&gt
	       ...stuff...
	     &lt/head1&gt

	   For example, a directive consisting of this:

	     =head1 Options to C&ltnew&gt et al.

	   will produce this event structure:

	     &lthead1 start_line="543"&gt
	       Options to
	       &ltC&gt
		 new
	       &lt/C&gt
		et al.
	     &lt/head1&gt

	   "=head2" thru "=head4" directives are the same, except for the
	   element names in the event structure.

       events with an element_name of over-bullet
	   When an "=over ... =back" block is parsed where the items are a
	   bulletted list, it will produce this event structure:

	     &ltover-bullet indent="4" start_line="543"&gt
	       &ltitem-bullet start_line="545"&gt
		 ...Stuff...
	       &lt/item-bullet&gt
	       ...more item-bullets...
	     &lt/over-bullet&gt

	   The value of the indent attribute is whatever value is after the
	   "=over" directive, as in "=over 8".	If no such value is specified
	   in the directive, then the indent attribute has the value "4".

	   For example, this Pod source:

	     =over

	     =item *

	     Stuff

	     =item *

	     Bar I&ltbaz&gt!

	     =back

	   produces this event structure:

	     &ltover-bullet indent="4" start_line="10"&gt
	       &ltitem-bullet start_line="12"&gt
		 Stuff
	       &lt/item-bullet&gt
	       &ltitem-bullet start_line="14"&gt
		 Bar &ltI&gtbaz&lt/I&gt!
	       &lt/item-bullet&gt
	     &lt/over-bullet&gt

       events with an element_name of over-number
	   When an "=over ... =back" block is parsed where the items are a
	   numbered list, it will produce this event structure:

	     &ltover-number indent="4" start_line="543"&gt
	       &ltitem-number number="1" start_line="545"&gt
		 ...Stuff...
	       &lt/item-number&gt
	       ...more item-number...
	     &lt/over-bullet&gt

	   This is like the "over-bullet" event structure; but note that the
	   contents are "item-number" instead of "item-bullet", and note that
	   they will have a "number" attribute, which some
	   formatters/processors may ignore (since, for example, there's no
	   need for it in HTML when producing an "&ltUL&gt&ltLI&gt...&lt/LI&gt...&lt/UL&gt"
	   structure), but which any processor may use.

	   Note that the values for the number attributes of "item-number"
	   elements in a given "over-number" area will start at 1 and go up by
	   one each time.  If the Pod source doesn't follow that order (even
	   though it really should should!), whatever numbers it has will be
	   ignored (with the correct values being put in the number
	   attributes), and an error message might be issued to the user.

       events with an element_name of over-text
	   These events are are somewhat unlike the other over-* structures,
	   as far as what their contents are.  When an "=over ... =back" block
	   is parsed where the items are a list of text "subheadings", it will
	   produce this event structure:

	     &ltover-text indent="4" start_line="543"&gt
	       &ltitem-text&gt
		 ...stuff...
	       &lt/item-text&gt
	       ...stuff (generally Para or Verbatim elements)...
	       &ltitem-text&gt
	       ...more item-text and/or stuff...
	     &lt/over-text&gt

	   The indent attribute is as with the other over-* events.

	   For example, this Pod source:

	     =over

	     =item Foo

	     Stuff

	     =item Bar I&ltbaz&gt!

	     Quux

	     =back

	   produces this event structure:

	     &ltover-text indent="4" start_line="20"&gt
	       &ltitem-text start_line="22"&gt
		 Foo
	       &lt/item-text&gt
	       &ltPara start_line="24"&gt
		 Stuff
	       &lt/Para&gt
	       &ltitem-text start_line="26"&gt
		 Bar
		   &ltI&gt
		     baz
		   &lt/I&gt
		 !
	       &lt/item-text&gt
	       &ltPara start_line="28"&gt
		 Quux
	       &lt/Para&gt
	     &lt/over-text&gt

       events with an element_name of over-block
	   These events are are somewhat unlike the other over-* structures,
	   as far as what their contents are.  When an "=over ... =back" block
	   is parsed where there are no items, it will produce this event
	   structure:

	     &ltover-block indent="4" start_line="543"&gt
	       ...stuff (generally Para or Verbatim elements)...
	     &lt/over-block&gt

	   The indent attribute is as with the other over-* events.

	   For example, this Pod source:

	     =over

	     For cutting off our trade with all parts of the world

	     For transporting us beyond seas to be tried for pretended offenses

	     He is at this time transporting large armies of foreign mercenaries to
	     complete the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with
	     circumstances of cruelty and perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most
	     barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the head of a civilized nation.

	     =cut

	   will produce this event structure:

	     &ltover-block indent="4" start_line="2"&gt
	       &ltPara start_line="4"&gt
		 For cutting off our trade with all parts of the world
	       &lt/Para&gt
	       &ltPara start_line="6"&gt
		 For transporting us beyond seas to be tried for pretended offenses
	       &lt/Para&gt
	       &ltPara start_line="8"&gt
		 He is at this time transporting large armies of [...more text...]

More Pod::Simple Methods
       Pod::Simple provides a lot of methods that aren't generally interesting
       to the end user of an existing Pod formatter, but some of which you
       might find useful in writing a Pod formatter. They are listed below.
       The first several methods (the accept_* methods) are for declaring the
       capabilites of your parser, notably what "=for targetname" sections
       it's interested in, what extra N&lt...&gt codes it accepts beyond the ones
       described in the perlpod.

       "$parser-&gtaccept_targets( SOMEVALUE )"
	   As the parser sees sections like:

	       =for html  &ltimg src="fig1.jpg"&gt

	   or

	       =begin html

		 &ltimg src="fig1.jpg"&gt

	       =end html

	   ...the parser will ignore these sections unless your subclass has
	   specified that it wants to see sections targetted to "html" (or
	   whatever the formatter name is).

	   If you want to process all sections, even if they're not targetted
	   for you, call this before you start parsing:

	     $parser-&gtaccept_targets('*');

       "$parser-&gtaccept_targets_as_text(  SOMEVALUE  )"
	   This is like accept_targets, except that it specifies also that the
	   content of sections for this target should be treated as Pod text
	   even if the target name in "=for targetname" doesn't start with a
	   ":".

	   At time of writing, I don't think you'll need to use this.

       "$parser-&gtaccept_codes( Codename, Codename...  )"
	   This tells the parser that you accept additional formatting codes,
	   beyond just the standard ones (I B C L F S X, plus the two weird
	   ones you don't actually see in the parse tree, Z and E). For
	   example, to also accept codes "N", "R", and "W":

	       $parser-&gtaccept_codes( qw( N R W ) );

	   TODO: document how this interacts with =extend, and long element
	   names

       "$parser-&gtaccept_directive_as_data( directive_name )"
       "$parser-&gtaccept_directive_as_verbatim( directive_name )"
       "$parser-&gtaccept_directive_as_processed( directive_name )"
	   In the unlikely situation that you need to tell the parser that you
	   will accept additional directives ("=foo" things), you need to
	   first set the parset to treat its content as data (i.e., not really
	   processed at all), or as verbatim (mostly just expanding tabs), or
	   as processed text (parsing formatting codes like B&lt...&gt).

	   For example, to accept a new directive "=method", you'd presumably
	   use:

	       $parser-&gtaccept_directive_as_processed("method");

	   so that you could have Pod lines like:

	       =method I&lt$whatever&gt thing B&ltum&gt

	   Making up your own directives breaks compatibility with other Pod
	   formatters, in a way that using "=for target ..." lines doesn't;
	   however, you may find this useful if you're making a Pod superset
	   format where you don't need to worry about compatibility.

       "$parser-&gtnbsp_for_S( BOOLEAN );"
	   Setting this attribute to a true value (and by default it is false)
	   will turn "S&lt...&gt" sequences into sequences of words separated by
	   "\xA0" (non-breaking space) characters. For example, it will take
	   this:

	       I like S&ltDutch apple pie&gt, don't you?

	   and treat it as if it were:

	       I like DutchE&ltnbsp&gtappleE&ltnbsp&gtpie, don't you?

	   This is handy for output formats that don't have anything quite
	   like an "S&lt...&gt" code, but which do have a code for non-breaking
	   space.

	   There is currently no method for going the other way; but I can
	   probably provide one upon request.

       "$parser-&gtversion_report()"
	   This returns a string reporting the $VERSION value from your module
	   (and its classname) as well as the $VERSION value of Pod::Simple.
	   Note that perlpodspec requires output formats (wherever possible)
	   to note this detail in a comment in the output format.  For
	   example, for some kind of SGML output format:

	       print OUT "&lt!-- \n", $parser-&gtversion_report, "\n --&gt";

       "$parser-&gtpod_para_count()"
	   This returns the count of Pod paragraphs seen so far.

       "$parser-&gtline_count()"
	   This is the current line number being parsed. But you might find
	   the "line_number" event attribute more accurate, when it is
	   present.

       "$parser-&gtnix_X_codes(  SOMEVALUE  )"
	   This attribute, when set to a true value (and it is false by
	   default) ignores any "X&lt...&gt" sequences in the document being
	   parsed.  Many formats don't actually use the content of these
	   codes, so have no reason to process them.

       "$parser-&gtmerge_text(  SOMEVALUE  )"
	   This attribute, when set to a true value (and it is false by
	   default) makes sure that only one event (or token, or node) will be
	   created for any single contiguous sequence of text.	For example,
	   consider this somewhat contrived example:

	       I just LOVE Z&lt&gthotE&lt32&gtapple pie!

	   When that is parsed and events are about to be called on it, it may
	   actually seem to be four different text events, one right after
	   another: one event for "I just LOVE ", one for "hot", one for " ",
	   and one for "apple pie!". But if you have merge_text on, then
	   you're guaranteed that it will be fired as one text event:  "I just
	   LOVE hot apple pie!".

       "$parser-&gtcode_handler(	CODE_REF  )"
	   This specifies code that should be called when a code line is seen
	   (i.e., a line outside of the Pod).  Normally this is undef, meaning
	   that no code should be called.  If you provide a routine, it should
	   start out like this:

	       sub get_code_line {  # or whatever you'll call it
		 my($line, $line_number, $parser) = @_;
		 ...
	       }

	   Note, however, that sometimes the Pod events aren't processed in
	   exactly the same order as the code lines are -- i.e., if you have a
	   file with Pod, then code, then more Pod, sometimes the code will be
	   processed (via whatever you have code_handler call) before the all
	   of the preceding Pod has been processed.

       "$parser-&gtcut_handler(  CODE_REF  )"
	   This is just like the code_handler attribute, except that it's for
	   "=cut" lines, not code lines. The same caveats apply. "=cut" lines
	   are unlikely to be interesting, but this is included for
	   completeness.

       "$parser-&gtwhine( linenumber, complaint string )"
	   This notes a problem in the Pod, which will be reported to in the
	   "Pod Errors" section of the document and/or send to STDERR,
	   depending on the values of the attributes "no_whining",
	   "no_errata_section", and "complain_stderr".

       "$parser-&gtscream( linenumber, complaint string )"
	   This notes an error like "whine" does, except that it is not
	   suppressable with "no_whining". This should be used only for very
	   serious errors.

       "$parser-&gtsource_dead(1)"
	   This aborts parsing of the current document, by switching on the
	   flag that indicates that EOF has been seen.	In particularly
	   drastic cases, you might want to do this.  It's rather nicer than
	   just calling "die"!

       "$parser-&gthide_line_numbers( SOMEVALUE )"
	   Some subclasses that indescriminately dump event attributes (well,
	   except for ones beginning with "~") can use this object attribute
	   for refraining to dump the "start_line" attribute.

       "$parser-&gtno_whining( SOMEVALUE )"
	   This attribute, if set to true, will suppress reports of non-fatal
	   error messages.  The default value is false, meaning that
	   complaints are reported.  How they get reported depends on the
	   values of the attributes "no_errata_section" and "complain_stderr".

       "$parser-&gtno_errata_section( SOMEVALUE )"
	   This attribute, if set to true, will suppress generation of an
	   errata section.  The default value is false -- i.e., an errata
	   section will be generated.

       "$parser-&gtcomplain_stderr( SOMEVALUE )"
	   This attribute, if set to true will send complaints to STDERR.  The
	   default value is false -- i.e., complaints do not go to STDERR.

       "$parser-&gtbare_output( SOMEVALUE )"
	   Some formatter subclasses use this as a flag for whether output
	   should have prologue and epilogue code omitted. For example,
	   setting this to true for an HTML formatter class should omit the
	   "&lthtml&gt&lthead&gt&lttitle&gt...&lt/title&gt&ltbody&gt..." prologue and the
	   "&lt/body&gt&lt/html&gt" epilogue.

	   If you want to set this to true, you should probably also set
	   "no_whining" or at least "no_errata_section" to true.

       "$parser-&gtpreserve_whitespace( SOMEVALUE )"
	   If you set this attribute to a true value, the parser will try to
	   preserve whitespace in the output.  This means that such formatting
	   conventions as two spaces after periods will be preserved by the
	   parser.  This is primarily useful for output formats that treat
	   whitespace as significant (such as text or *roff, but not HTML).
