NAME
       git-show - Show various types of objects

SYNOPSIS
       git show [options] &ltobject&gt...


DESCRIPTION
       Shows one or more objects (blobs, trees, tags and commits).

       For commits it shows the log message and textual diff. It also presents
       the merge commit in a special format as produced by git diff-tree --cc.

       For tags, it shows the tag message and the referenced objects.

       For trees, it shows the names (equivalent to git ls-tree with
       --name-only).

       For plain blobs, it shows the plain contents.

       The command takes options applicable to the git diff-tree command to
       control how the changes the commit introduces are shown.

       This manual page describes only the most frequently used options.

OPTIONS
       &ltobject&gt...
	   The names of objects to show. For a more complete list of ways to
	   spell object names, see "SPECIFYING REVISIONS" section in
	   gitrevisions(7).

       --pretty[=&ltformat&gt], --format=&ltformat&gt
	   Pretty-print the contents of the commit logs in a given format,
	   where &ltformat&gt can be one of oneline, short, medium, full, fuller,
	   email, raw and format:&ltstring&gt. See the "PRETTY FORMATS" section
	   for some additional details for each format. When omitted, the
	   format defaults to medium.

	   Note: you can specify the default pretty format in the repository
	   configuration (see git-config(1)).

       --abbrev-commit
	   Instead of showing the full 40-byte hexadecimal commit object name,
	   show only a partial prefix. Non default number of digits can be
	   specified with "--abbrev=&ltn&gt" (which also modifies diff output, if
	   it is displayed).

	   This should make "--pretty=oneline" a whole lot more readable for
	   people using 80-column terminals.

       --no-abbrev-commit
	   Show the full 40-byte hexadecimal commit object name. This negates
	   --abbrev-commit and those options which imply it such as
	   "--oneline". It also overrides the log.abbrevCommit variable.

       --oneline
	   This is a shorthand for "--pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit" used
	   together.

       --encoding[=&ltencoding&gt]
	   The commit objects record the encoding used for the log message in
	   their encoding header; this option can be used to tell the command
	   to re-code the commit log message in the encoding preferred by the
	   user. For non plumbing commands this defaults to UTF-8.

       --notes[=&ltref&gt]
	   Show the notes (see git-notes(1)) that annotate the commit, when
	   showing the commit log message. This is the default for git log,
	   git show and git whatchanged commands when there is no --pretty,
	   --format nor --oneline option given on the command line.

	   By default, the notes shown are from the notes refs listed in the
	   core.notesRef and notes.displayRef variables (or corresponding
	   environment overrides). See git-config(1) for more details.

	   With an optional &ltref&gt argument, show this notes ref instead of the
	   default notes ref(s). The ref is taken to be in refs/notes/ if it
	   is not qualified.

	   Multiple --notes options can be combined to control which notes are
	   being displayed. Examples: "--notes=foo" will show only notes from
	   "refs/notes/foo"; "--notes=foo --notes" will show both notes from
	   "refs/notes/foo" and from the default notes ref(s).

       --no-notes
	   Do not show notes. This negates the above --notes option, by
	   resetting the list of notes refs from which notes are shown.
	   Options are parsed in the order given on the command line, so e.g.
	   "--notes --notes=foo --no-notes --notes=bar" will only show notes
	   from "refs/notes/bar".

       --show-notes[=&ltref&gt], --[no-]standard-notes
	   These options are deprecated. Use the above --notes/--no-notes
	   options instead.

PRETTY FORMATS
       If the commit is a merge, and if the pretty-format is not oneline,
       email or raw, an additional line is inserted before the Author: line.
       This line begins with "Merge: " and the sha1s of ancestral commits are
       printed, separated by spaces. Note that the listed commits may not
       necessarily be the list of the direct parent commits if you have
       limited your view of history: for example, if you are only interested
       in changes related to a certain directory or file.

       There are several built-in formats, and you can define additional
       formats by setting a pretty.&ltname&gt config option to either another
       format name, or a format: string, as described below (see git-
       config(1)). Here are the details of the built-in formats:

       o    oneline

	       &ltsha1&gt &lttitle line&gt

	   This is designed to be as compact as possible.

       o    short

	       commit &ltsha1&gt
	       Author: &ltauthor&gt

	       &lttitle line&gt

       o    medium

	       commit &ltsha1&gt
	       Author: &ltauthor&gt
	       Date:   &ltauthor date&gt

	       &lttitle line&gt

	       &ltfull commit message&gt

       o    full

	       commit &ltsha1&gt
	       Author: &ltauthor&gt
	       Commit: &ltcommitter&gt

	       &lttitle line&gt

	       &ltfull commit message&gt

       o    fuller

	       commit &ltsha1&gt
	       Author:	   &ltauthor&gt
	       AuthorDate: &ltauthor date&gt
	       Commit:	   &ltcommitter&gt
	       CommitDate: &ltcommitter date&gt

	       &lttitle line&gt

	       &ltfull commit message&gt

       o    email

	       From &ltsha1&gt &ltdate&gt
	       From: &ltauthor&gt
	       Date: &ltauthor date&gt
	       Subject: [PATCH] &lttitle line&gt

	       &ltfull commit message&gt

       o    raw

	   The raw format shows the entire commit exactly as stored in the
	   commit object. Notably, the SHA1s are displayed in full, regardless
	   of whether --abbrev or --no-abbrev are used, and parents
	   information show the true parent commits, without taking grafts nor
	   history simplification into account.

       o    format:&ltstring&gt

	   The format:&ltstring&gt format allows you to specify which information
	   you want to show. It works a little bit like printf format, with
	   the notable exception that you get a newline with %n instead of \n.

	   E.g, format:"The author of %h was %an, %ar%nThe title was &gt&gt%s&lt&lt%n"
	   would show something like this:

	       The author of fe6e0ee was Junio C Hamano, 23 hours ago
	       The title was &gt&gtt4119: test autocomputing -p&ltn&gt for traditional diff input.&lt&lt

	   The placeholders are:

	   o	%H: commit hash

	   o	%h: abbreviated commit hash

	   o	%T: tree hash

	   o	%t: abbreviated tree hash

	   o	%P: parent hashes

	   o	%p: abbreviated parent hashes

	   o	%an: author name

	   o	%aN: author name (respecting .mailmap, see git-shortlog(1) or
	       git-blame(1))

	   o	%ae: author email

	   o	%aE: author email (respecting .mailmap, see git-shortlog(1) or
	       git-blame(1))

	   o	%ad: author date (format respects --date= option)

	   o	%aD: author date, RFC2822 style

	   o	%ar: author date, relative

	   o	%at: author date, UNIX timestamp

	   o	%ai: author date, ISO 8601 format

	   o	%cn: committer name

	   o	%cN: committer name (respecting .mailmap, see git-shortlog(1)
	       or git-blame(1))

	   o	%ce: committer email

	   o	%cE: committer email (respecting .mailmap, see git-shortlog(1)
	       or git-blame(1))

	   o	%cd: committer date

	   o	%cD: committer date, RFC2822 style

	   o	%cr: committer date, relative

	   o	%ct: committer date, UNIX timestamp

	   o	%ci: committer date, ISO 8601 format

	   o	%d: ref names, like the --decorate option of git-log(1)

	   o	%e: encoding

	   o	%s: subject

	   o	%f: sanitized subject line, suitable for a filename

	   o	%b: body

	   o	%B: raw body (unwrapped subject and body)

	   o	%N: commit notes

	   o	%gD: reflog selector, e.g., refs/stash@{1}

	   o	%gd: shortened reflog selector, e.g., stash@{1}

	   o	%gn: reflog identity name

	   o	%gN: reflog identity name (respecting .mailmap, see git-
	       shortlog(1) or git-blame(1))

	   o	%ge: reflog identity email

	   o	%gE: reflog identity email (respecting .mailmap, see git-
	       shortlog(1) or git-blame(1))

	   o	%gs: reflog subject

	   o	%Cred: switch color to red

	   o	%Cgreen: switch color to green

	   o	%Cblue: switch color to blue

	   o	%Creset: reset color

	   o	%C(...): color specification, as described in color.branch.*
	       config option

	   o	%m: left, right or boundary mark

	   o	%n: newline

	   o	%%: a raw %

	   o	%x00: print a byte from a hex code

	   o	%w([&ltw&gt[,&lti1&gt[,&lti2&gt]]]): switch line wrapping, like the -w
	       option of git-shortlog(1).

	   Note
	   Some placeholders may depend on other options given to the revision
	   traversal engine. For example, the %g* reflog options will insert
	   an empty string unless we are traversing reflog entries (e.g., by
	   git log -g). The %d placeholder will use the "short" decoration
	   format if --decorate was not already provided on the command line.

       If you add a + (plus sign) after % of a placeholder, a line-feed is
       inserted immediately before the expansion if and only if the
       placeholder expands to a non-empty string.

       If you add a - (minus sign) after % of a placeholder, line-feeds that
       immediately precede the expansion are deleted if and only if the
       placeholder expands to an empty string.

       If you add a ` ` (space) after % of a placeholder, a space is inserted
       immediately before the expansion if and only if the placeholder expands
       to a non-empty string.

       o    tformat:

	   The tformat: format works exactly like format:, except that it
	   provides "terminator" semantics instead of "separator" semantics.
	   In other words, each commit has the message terminator character
	   (usually a newline) appended, rather than a separator placed
	   between entries. This means that the final entry of a single-line
	   format will be properly terminated with a new line, just as the
	   "oneline" format does. For example:

	       $ git log -2 --pretty=format:%h 4da45bef \
		 | perl -pe '$_ .= " -- NO NEWLINE\n" unless /\n/'
	       4da45be
	       7134973 -- NO NEWLINE

	       $ git log -2 --pretty=tformat:%h 4da45bef \
		 | perl -pe '$_ .= " -- NO NEWLINE\n" unless /\n/'
	       4da45be
	       7134973

	   In addition, any unrecognized string that has a % in it is
	   interpreted as if it has tformat: in front of it. For example,
	   these two are equivalent:

	       $ git log -2 --pretty=tformat:%h 4da45bef
	       $ git log -2 --pretty=%h 4da45bef


EXAMPLES
       git show v1.0.0
	   Shows the tag v1.0.0, along with the object the tags points at.

       git show v1.0.0^{tree}
	   Shows the tree pointed to by the tag v1.0.0.

       git show -s --format=%s v1.0.0^{commit}
	   Shows the subject of the commit pointed to by the tag v1.0.0.

       git show next~10:Documentation/README
	   Shows the contents of the file Documentation/README as they were
	   current in the 10th last commit of the branch next.

       git show master:Makefile master:t/Makefile
	   Concatenates the contents of said Makefiles in the head of the
	   branch master.

DISCUSSION
       At the core level, git is character encoding agnostic.

       o   The pathnames recorded in the index and in the tree objects are
	   treated as uninterpreted sequences of non-NUL bytes. What
	   readdir(2) returns are what are recorded and compared with the data
	   git keeps track of, which in turn are expected to be what lstat(2)
	   and creat(2) accepts. There is no such thing as pathname encoding
	   translation.

       o   The contents of the blob objects are uninterpreted sequences of
	   bytes. There is no encoding translation at the core level.

       o   The commit log messages are uninterpreted sequences of non-NUL
	   bytes.

       Although we encourage that the commit log messages are encoded in
       UTF-8, both the core and git Porcelain are designed not to force UTF-8
       on projects. If all participants of a particular project find it more
       convenient to use legacy encodings, git does not forbid it. However,
       there are a few things to keep in mind.

	1.  git commit and git commit-tree issues a warning if the commit log
	   message given to it does not look like a valid UTF-8 string, unless
	   you explicitly say your project uses a legacy encoding. The way to
	   say this is to have i18n.commitencoding in .git/config file, like
	   this:

	       [i18n]
		       commitencoding = ISO-8859-1

	   Commit objects created with the above setting record the value of
	   i18n.commitencoding in its encoding header. This is to help other
	   people who look at them later. Lack of this header implies that the
	   commit log message is encoded in UTF-8.

	2.  git log, git show, git blame and friends look at the encoding
	   header of a commit object, and try to re-code the log message into
	   UTF-8 unless otherwise specified. You can specify the desired
	   output encoding with i18n.logoutputencoding in .git/config file,
	   like this:

	       [i18n]
		       logoutputencoding = ISO-8859-1

	   If you do not have this configuration variable, the value of
	   i18n.commitencoding is used instead.

       Note that we deliberately chose not to re-code the commit log message
       when a commit is made to force UTF-8 at the commit object level,
       because re-coding to UTF-8 is not necessarily a reversible operation.
