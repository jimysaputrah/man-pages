NAME
       Mac::OSA::Simple - Simple access to Mac::OSA

SYNOPSIS
	   #!perl -wl
	   use Mac::OSA::Simple;
	   osa_script('LAND', &lt&lt'EOS');
	     dialog.getInt ("Duration?",@examples.duration);
	     dialog.getInt ("Amplitude?",@examples.amplitude);
	     dialog.getInt ("Frequency?",@examples.frequency);
	     speaker.sound (examples.duration, examples.amplitude,
		 examples.frequency)
	   EOS

	   print frontier('clock.now()');

	   applescript('beep 3');

DESCRIPTION
       You can access scripting components via the tied hash %ScriptComponents
       which is automatically exported.  Components are only opened if they
       have not been already, and are closed when the program exits.  It is
       normally not necessary to use this hash, as it is accessed internally
       when needed.

       Also usually not necessary, but possibly useful, are all the functions
       and constants from Mac::OSA, available with the EXPORT_TAG "all".

       NOTE: Examples below show use of $^E.  On Mac OS, this will return the
       signed Mac OS error number in numeric context, and the Mac OS error
       message in string context.  But on Mac OS X, $^E support is
       unimplemented.  $! and $^E will both return the unsigned error number.
       You can get the correct error number by adding 0 (such as "$! + 0"),
       and you can use Mac::Errors to get the error text (this will also work
       under Mac OS):

	       use Mac::Errors '$MacError';
	       my $res = FSpOpenResFile($file, 0) or die $MacError;

       See Mac::Errors on the CPAN for more information.

   Functions
       The following functions are automatically exported.

       osa_script(SCRIPTCOMPONENT, SCRIPTTEXT)
	   Compiles and executes SCRIPTTEXT, using four-char SCRIPTCOMPONENT.
	   Component is opened and closed behind the scenes, and SCRIPTTEXT is
	   compiled, executed, and disposed of behind the scenes.  If the
	   script returns data, the function returns the data, else it returns
	   1 or undef on failure.

       applescript(SCRIPTTEXT)
       frontier(SCRIPTTEXT)
	   Same thing as "osa_script" with SCRIPTCOMPONENT already set ('ascr'
	   for AppleScript, 'LAND' for Frontier).

       compile_osa_script(SCRIPTCOMPONENT, SCRIPTTEXT)
	   Compiles script as "osa_script" above, but does not execute it.
	   Returns Mac::OSA::Simple object.  See "Methods" for more
	   information.

       compile_applescript(SCRIPTTEXT)
       compile_frontier(SCRIPTTEXT)
	   Same thing as "compile_osa_script" with SCRIPTCOMPONENT already
	   set.

       load_osa_script(HANDLE)
       load_osa_script(FILE [, RESOURCEID])
	   In the first form, load compiled OSA script using data in Handle
	   (same data as returned by "compiled" method; see Mac::Memory).  In
	   the second form, gets script from FILE using RESOURCEID (which is
	   128 by default).  Returns Mac::OSA::Simple object.

	   NOTE: Because of a change in the parameters for this function, a
	   RESOURCEID value of 1 will not be recognized as a resource ID (the
	   old parameter list had a value of 1 mean "load from file").	If you
	   need to use a resource ID of 1, pass it in as both the second and
	   third parameter.  Sorry.  Why would you use 1 for a resource ID,
	   anyway??

	   Example:

	       use Mac::OSA::Simple qw(:all);
	       use Mac::Resources;
	       $res = FSpOpenResFile($file, 0) or die $^E;
	       $scpt = Get1Resource(kOSAScriptResourceType, 128)
		   or die $^E;
	       $osa = load_osa_script($scpt);
	       $osa-&gtexecute;
	       CloseResFile($res);

	   Same thing:

	       use Mac::OSA::Simple;
	       $osa = load_osa_script($file);
	       $osa-&gtexecute;

	   Another example:

	       use Mac::OSA::Simple;
	       $osa1 = compile_applescript('return "foo"');
	       print $osa1-&gtexecute;

	       # make copy of script in $osa1 and execute it
	       $osa2 = load_osa_script($osa1-&gtcompiled);
	       print $osa2-&gtexecute;

	   See "Methods" for more information.

   Methods
       This section describes methods for use on objects returned by
       "compile_osa_script" and its related functions and "load_osa_script".

       compiled
	   Returns a Handle containing the raw compiled form of the script
	   (see Mac::Memory).

       dispose
	   Disposes of OSA script.  Done automatically if not called
	   explicitly.

       execute
	   Executes script.  Can be executed more than once.

       call(CLASS, EVENT, ARGS, MODE)
	   Calls a handler in the script, identified by CLASS and EVENT IDs.
	   Can be executed more than once.

	   ARGS can be either a scalar or an arrayref.	MODE can be any
	   combination of modes from Mac::OSA listed under the "Mode flags"
	   constants.

	   Here is an example script:

		   on \xC7event abcd1234E\xC8 (filename)
		       tell app "Finder"
			  return [URL of file filename, creator type of file filename]
		       end
		   end

	   "abcd" is the CLASS ID, and "1234" is the EVENT ID.	They can be
	   anything, as long as they don't conflict with something else.  The
	   characters \xC7 and \xC8 can be literal if in the Mac Roman
	   charset, otherwise just use the values like above.

	   Parameters are passed to handlers as named values, like
	   "(filename)".  Multiple parameters can be passed as an arrayref in
	   ARGS, and a list of values is returned:

		   my $script = load_osa_script($path_to_script);
		   my($url, $creator) = $script-&gtcall(qw[abcd 1234], "my file");

	   You must pass in the same number of variables in ARGS that are
	   expected by the handler.

       save(FILE [, ID [, NAME]])
	   Saves script in FILE with ID and NAME.  ID defaults to 128, NAME
	   defaults to "MacPerl Script".  DANGEROUS!  Will overwrite existing
	   resource or file!

	   Saves to the data fork instead on Mac OS X, unless an ID is
	   provided.

	   The context used to load a script from disk (resource fork vs. data
	   fork, resource file vs. data file) will be used to save the script
	   back, if applicable, so the file's format will be preserved.

       source
	   Returns text of script source, if available.

   Script Context
       Scripts compiled by this module now compile scripts as script contexts,
       which, in part, means they can maintain state information.  For
       example:

	       use Mac::OSA::Simple;
	       my $script = compile_applescript(&lt&lt'SCRIPT') or die $^E;
	       property foo: 20
	       set foo to foo + 1
	       SCRIPT
	       print $script-&gtexecute, "\n" for 0..2;

       Returns:      21      22      23

       Whereas in previous versions of this module, it would have returned:
	    21	    21	    21

       For a script that on disk, to maintain state information in the saved
       version, remember to call "$script-"save(LIST)&gt.

TODO
       Work on error handling.	We don't want to die when a toolbox function
       fails.  We'd rather return undef and have the user check $^E.

       Should "frontier" and/or "osa_script('LAND', $script)" launch Frontier
       if it is not running?

       Add "run_osa_script", which could take script data in a Handle or a
       path to a script (as with "load_osa_script".

       Should "save" have optional parameter for overwriting resource?

       Should "run_osa_script" and "execute" take arguments?  If so, how?
