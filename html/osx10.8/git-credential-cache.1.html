NAME
       git-credential-cache - helper to temporarily store passwords in memory

SYNOPSIS
       git config credential.helper 'cache [options]'


DESCRIPTION
       This command caches credentials in memory for use by future git
       programs. The stored credentials never touch the disk, and are
       forgotten after a configurable timeout. The cache is accessible over a
       Unix domain socket, restricted to the current user by filesystem
       permissions.

       You probably don't want to invoke this command directly; it is meant to
       be used as a credential helper by other parts of git. See
       gitcredentials(7) or EXAMPLES below.

OPTIONS
       --timeout &ltseconds&gt
	   Number of seconds to cache credentials (default: 900).

       --socket &ltpath&gt
	   Use &ltpath&gt to contact a running cache daemon (or start a new cache
	   daemon if one is not started). Defaults to
	   ~/.git-credential-cache/socket. If your home directory is on a
	   network-mounted filesystem, you may need to change this to a local
	   filesystem.

CONTROLLING THE DAEMON
       If you would like the daemon to exit early, forgetting all cached
       credentials before their timeout, you can issue an exit action:

	   git credential-cache exit


EXAMPLES
       The point of this helper is to reduce the number of times you must type
       your username or password. For example:

	   $ git config credential.helper cache
	   $ git push http://example.com/repo.git
	   Username: &lttype your username&gt
	   Password: &lttype your password&gt

	   [work for 5 more minutes]
	   $ git push http://example.com/repo.git
	   [your credentials are used automatically]


       You can provide options via the credential.helper configuration
       variable (this example drops the cache time to 5 minutes):

	   $ git config credential.helper 'cache --timeout=300'
