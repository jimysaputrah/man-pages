NAME
       Net::LDAP::Control::VLVResponse -- LDAPv3 Virtual List View server
       response

SYNOPSIS
       See Net::LDAP::Control::VLV

DESCRIPTION
       "Net::LDAP::Control::VLVResponse" is a sub-class of Net::LDAP::Control.
       It provides a class for manipulating the LDAP Virtual List View
       Response control ""

       If the server supports Virtual List Views, then the response from a
       search operation will include a VLVResponse control.

CONSTRUCTOR ARGUMENTS
       In addition to the constructor arguments described in
       Net::LDAP::Control the following are provided.

       content
	   An estimate of the number of entries in the complete list. This
	   value should be used in any subsequent Virtual List View control
	   using the same list.

       context
	   An arbitary value which is used to associate subsequent requests
	   with the request which this control is a response for. This value
	   should be copied by the client into the Virtual List View control
	   for any subsequent search that uses the same list.

       result
	   A result code indicating the result of the Virtual List View
	   request. This may be any of the codes listed below.

       target
	   The list offset of the target entry.

METHODS
       As with Net::LDAP::Control each constructor argument described above is
       also avaliable as a method on the object which will return the current
       value for the attribute if called without an argument, and set a new
       value for the attribute if called with an argument.

RESULT CODES
       Possible results from a sort request are listed below. See
       Net::LDAP::Constant for a definition of each.

       LDAP_SUCCESS
       LDAP_OPERATIONS_ERROR
       LDAP_TIMELIMIT_EXCEEDED
       LDAP_ADMIN_LIMIT_EXCEEDED
       LDAP_INSUFFICIENT_ACCESS
