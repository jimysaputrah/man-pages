XSANCTL(8)		  BSD System Manager's Manual		    XSANCTL(8)

NAME
     xsanctl -- Xsan file system control utility

SYNOPSYS
     xsanctl command [arg [...]]

DESCRIPTION
     xsanctl provides a basic control facility for the Xsan file system.  It
     operates by sending commands to the Xsan file system management daemon
     xsand.  xsanctl must be run by the superuser.

COMMANDS
     xsanctl provides the following commands:

     help		     Display a list of the available xsanctl commands.

     ping		     Sends a `ping' message to xsand.  This can be
			     used to verify that xsand is responding to man-
			     agement requests.

     mount volumeName	     Mounts the volume volumeName.  After the volume
			     is successfully mounted, the Xsan volume auto-
			     mount state is updated to reflect that this vol-
			     ume should be automatically mounted at startup
			     time.  This is the preferred method of mounting
			     Xsan volumes from the command line.

     unmount volumeName      Unmounts the volume volumeName.  After the volume
			     is successfully unmounted, the Xsan volume auto-
			     mount state is updated to reflect that this vol-
			     ume should not be automatically mounted at
			     startup time.  This is the preferred method of
			     unmounting Xsan volumes from the command line.

     sanConfigChanged	     Sends a notification to the Xsan file system that
			     the SAN configuration has changed and should be
			     reloaded.

     disksChanged	     Sends a notification to the Xsan file system that
			     disks have changed and should be rescanned.

     wipeConfig 	     Causes the Xsan file system configuration to be
			     reset to an unconfigured state.
