ALTER DOMAIN(7) 	PostgreSQL 9.1.4 Documentation	       ALTER DOMAIN(7)



NAME
       ALTER_DOMAIN - change the definition of a domain

SYNOPSIS
       ALTER DOMAIN name
	   { SET DEFAULT expression | DROP DEFAULT }
       ALTER DOMAIN name
	   { SET | DROP } NOT NULL
       ALTER DOMAIN name
	   ADD domain_constraint
       ALTER DOMAIN name
	   DROP CONSTRAINT constraint_name [ RESTRICT | CASCADE ]
       ALTER DOMAIN name
	   OWNER TO new_owner
       ALTER DOMAIN name
	   SET SCHEMA new_schema

DESCRIPTION
       ALTER DOMAIN changes the definition of an existing domain. There are
       several sub-forms:

       SET/DROP DEFAULT
	   These forms set or remove the default value for a domain. Note that
	   defaults only apply to subsequent INSERT commands; they do not
	   affect rows already in a table using the domain.

       SET/DROP NOT NULL
	   These forms change whether a domain is marked to allow NULL values
	   or to reject NULL values. You can only SET NOT NULL when the
	   columns using the domain contain no null values.

       ADD domain_constraint
	   This form adds a new constraint to a domain using the same syntax
	   as CREATE DOMAIN (CREATE_DOMAIN(7)). This will only succeed if all
	   columns using the domain satisfy the new constraint.

       DROP CONSTRAINT
	   This form drops constraints on a domain.

       OWNER
	   This form changes the owner of the domain to the specified user.

       SET SCHEMA
	   This form changes the schema of the domain. Any constraints
	   associated with the domain are moved into the new schema as well.

       You must own the domain to use ALTER DOMAIN. To change the schema of a
       domain, you must also have CREATE privilege on the new schema. To alter
       the owner, you must also be a direct or indirect member of the new
       owning role, and that role must have CREATE privilege on the domain's
       schema. (These restrictions enforce that altering the owner doesn't do
       anything you couldn't do by dropping and recreating the domain.
       However, a superuser can alter ownership of any domain anyway.)

PARAMETERS
       name
	   The name (possibly schema-qualified) of an existing domain to
	   alter.

       domain_constraint
	   New domain constraint for the domain.

       constraint_name
	   Name of an existing constraint to drop.

       CASCADE
	   Automatically drop objects that depend on the constraint.

       RESTRICT
	   Refuse to drop the constraint if there are any dependent objects.
	   This is the default behavior.

       new_owner
	   The user name of the new owner of the domain.

       new_schema
	   The new schema for the domain.

NOTES
       Currently, ALTER DOMAIN ADD CONSTRAINT and ALTER DOMAIN SET NOT NULL
       will fail if the named domain or any derived domain is used within a
       composite-type column of any table in the database. They should
       eventually be improved to be able to verify the new constraint for such
       nested columns.

EXAMPLES
       To add a NOT NULL constraint to a domain:

	   ALTER DOMAIN zipcode SET NOT NULL;

       To remove a NOT NULL constraint from a domain:

	   ALTER DOMAIN zipcode DROP NOT NULL;

       To add a check constraint to a domain:

	   ALTER DOMAIN zipcode ADD CONSTRAINT zipchk CHECK (char_length(VALUE) = 5);

       To remove a check constraint from a domain:

	   ALTER DOMAIN zipcode DROP CONSTRAINT zipchk;

       To move the domain into a different schema:

	   ALTER DOMAIN zipcode SET SCHEMA customers;

COMPATIBILITY
       ALTER DOMAIN conforms to the SQL standard, except for the OWNER and SET
       SCHEMA variants, which are PostgreSQL extensions.
