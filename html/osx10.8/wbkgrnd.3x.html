NAME
       bkgrnd,	wbkgrnd, bkgrndset, wbkgrndset, getbkgrnd, wgetbkgrnd - curses
       window complex background manipulation routines

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curses.h>

       int bkgrnd( const cchar_t *wch);
       int wbkgrnd( WINDOW *win, const cchar_t *wch);
       void bkgrndset(const cchar_t *wch );
       void wbkgrndset(WINDOW *win, const cchar_t *wch);
       int getbkgrnd(cchar_t *wch);
       int wgetbkgrnd(WINDOW *win, cchar_t *wch);

DESCRIPTION
       The bkgrndset and wbkgrndset routines manipulate the background of  the
       named  window.	The  window  background is a cchar_t consisting of any
       combination of attributes (i.e., rendition) and	a  complex  character.
       The  attribute part of the background is combined (OR'ed) with all non-
       blank characters that are written into the window  with	waddch.   Both
       the  character  and attribute parts of the background are combined with
       the blank characters.  The background becomes a property of the charac-
       ter   and   moves   with   the  character  through  any	scrolling  and
       insert/delete line/character operations.

       To the extent possible on a particular terminal, the attribute part  of
       the  background	is displayed as the graphic rendition of the character
       put on the screen.

       The bkgrnd and wbkgrnd functions set the  background  property  of  the
       current	or specified window and then apply this setting to every char-
       acter position in that window:

	      The rendition of every character on the screen is changed to the
	      new background rendition.

	      Wherever	the former background character appears, it is changed
	      to the new background character.

       The getbkgrnd function returns the given  window's  current  background
       character/attribute pair via the wch pointer.

NOTES
       Note that bkgrnd, bkgrndset, and getbkgrnd may be macros.

RETURN VALUES
       The bkgrndset and wbkgrndset routines do not return a value.

       Upon  successful completion, the other functions return OK.  Otherwise,
       they return ERR.  A null window pointer is treated as an error.
