NAME
       CPANPLUS::Internals::Search

SYNOPSIS
	   my $aref = $cpan->_search_module_tree(
			       type    => 'package',
			       allow   => [qr/DBI/],
			   );

	   my $aref = $cpan->_search_author_tree(
			       type    => 'cpanid',
			       data    => \@old_results,
			       verbose => 1,
			       allow   => [qw|KANE AUTRIJUS|],
			   );

	   my $aref = $cpan->_all_installed( );

DESCRIPTION
       The functions in this module are designed to find module(objects) based
       on certain criteria and return them.

METHODS
   _search_module_tree( type => TYPE, allow => \@regexes, [data =>
       \@previous_results ] )
       Searches the moduletree for module objects matching the criteria you
       specify. Returns an array ref of module objects on success, and false
       on failure.

       It takes the following arguments:

       type
	   This can be any of the accessors for the "CPANPLUS::Module"
	   objects.  This is a required argument.

       allow
	   A set of rules, or more precisely, a list of regexes (via "qr//" or
	   plain strings), that the "type" must adhere too. You can specify as
	   many as you like, and it will be treated as an "OR" search.	For an
	   "AND" search, see the "data" argument.

	   This is a required argument.

       data
	   An arrayref of previous search results. This is the way to do an
	   "AND" search -- "_search_module_tree" will only search the module
	   objects specified in "data" if provided, rather than the moduletree
	   itself.

   _search_author_tree( type => TYPE, allow => \@regexex, [data =>
       \@previous_results ] )
       Searches the authortree for author objects matching the criteria you
       specify. Returns an array ref of author objects on success, and false
       on failure.

       It takes the following arguments:

       type
	   This can be any of the accessors for the "CPANPLUS::Module::Author"
	   objects. This is a required argument.

       allow
	   A set of rules, or more precisely, a list of regexes (via "qr//" or
	   plain strings), that the "type" must adhere too. You can specify as
	   many as you like, and it will be treated as an "OR" search.	For an
	   "AND" search, see the "data" argument.

	   This is a required argument.

       data
	   An arrayref of previous search results. This is the way to do an
	   "and" search -- "_search_author_tree" will only search the author
	   objects specified in "data" if provided, rather than the authortree
	   itself.

   _all_installed()
       This function returns an array ref of module objects of modules that
       are installed on this system.
