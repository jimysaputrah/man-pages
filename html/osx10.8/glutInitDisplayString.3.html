NAME
       glutInitDisplayString - sets the initial display mode via a string.

SYNTAX
       #include &ltGLUT/glut.h&gt

       void glutInitDisplayString(char *string);

ARGUMENTS
       string	 Display mode description string, see below.

DESCRIPTION
       The  initial display mode description string is used when creating top-
       level windows, subwindows, and overlays to determine the OpenGL display
       mode for the to-be-created window or overlay.

       The  string is a list of zero or more capability descriptions separated
       by spaces and tabs.  Each capability description is a  capability  name
       that  is  optionally followed by a comparator and a numeric value.  For
       example, "double" and "depth&gt=12" are both valid criteria.

       The capability descriptions are translated into a set of criteria  used
       to select the appropriate frame buffer configuration.

       The  criteria  are matched in strict left to right order of precedence.
       That is, the first specified criteria (leftmost) takes precedence  over
       the  later  criteria  for  non-exact criteria (greater than, less than,
       etc. comparators).  Exact criteria (equal, not equal comparators)  must
       match exactly so precedence is not relevant.

       The  numeric  value  is an integer that is parsed according to ANSI C's
       strtol(str, strptr, 0) behavior.  This means that decimal, octal (lead-
       ing 0), and hexadecimal values (leading 0x) are accepted.

       The valid comparators are:

       =       Equal.

       !=      Not equal.

       &lt       Less than and preferring larger difference (the least is best).

       &gt       Greater than and preferring larger  differences	(the  most  is
	       best).

       &lt=      Less  than or equal and preferring larger difference (the least
	       is best).

       &gt=      Greater than or equal and  preferring  more  instead  of  less.
	       This  comparator  is useful for allocating resources like color
	       precision or depth buffer precision where the maximum precision
	       is  generally  preferred.  Contrast with the tilde (~) compara-
	       tor.

       ~       Greater than or equal but  preferring  less  instead  of  more.
	       This  comparator  is  useful  for  allocating resources such as
	       stencil bits or auxiliary color buffers where you would	rather
	       not over allocate.

	       When  the  comparator and numeric value are not specified, each
	       capability name has a different	default  (one  default	is  to
	       require a a comparator and numeric value).


       The valid capability names are:

       alpha   Alpha color buffer precision in bits.  Default is "&gt=1".

       acca    Red,  green,  blue,  and alpha accumulation buffer precision in
	       bits.  Default is "&gt=8" for red, green, blue, and  alpha  capa-
	       bilities.

       acc     Red, green, and green accumulation buffer precision in bits and
	       zero bits of alpha accumulation buffer precision.   Default  is
	       "&gt=8"  for  red, green, and blue capabilities, and "~0" for the
	       alpha capability.

       auxbufs Number of auxiliary color buffers.  Default is "~1".

       blue    Blue color buffer precision in bits.  Default is "&gt=1".

       buffer  Number of bits in the color index  color  buffer.   Default  is
	       "&gt=1".

       conformant
	       Boolean indicating if the frame buffer configuration is confor-
	       mant  or  not.	Conformance  information  is  based  on  GLX's
	       EXT_visual_rating  extension if supported.  If the extension is
	       not supported, all visuals are assumed conformant.  Default  is
	       "=1".

       depth   Number  of  bits  of precision in the depth buffer.  Default is
	       "&gt=12".

       double  Boolean indicating if the  color  buffer  is  double  buffered.
	       Default is "=1".

       green   Green color buffer precision in bits.  Default is "&gt=1".

       index   Boolean	if  the  color	model  is color index or not.  True is
	       color index.  Default is "&gt=1".

       luminance
	       Number of bits of red in the RGBA and zero bits of green,  blue
	       (alpha  not  specified)	of color buffer precision.  Default is
	       "&gt=1" for the red capabilities, and "=0" for the green and blue
	       capabilities,  and  "=1"  for  the RGBA color model capability,
	       and, for X11, "=1" for the StaticGray ("xstaticgray")  capabil-
	       ity.

	       SGI  InfiniteReality  (and  other  future  machines)  support a
	       16-bit luminance (single channel) display mode  (an  additional
	       16-bit  alpha  channel can also be requested).  The red channel
	       maps to gray scale and green and blue channels are  not	avail-
	       able.   A  16-bit  precision  luminance	display  mode is often
	       appropriate for medical imaging applications.   Do  not	expect
	       many  machines  to support extended precision luminance display
	       modes.

       num     A special capability name indicating where the value represents
	       the  Nth  frame	buffer	configuration matching the description
	       string.	When not specified, glutInitDisplayString also returns
	       the  first  (best matching) configuration.  num requires a com-
	       parator and numeric value.

       red     Red color buffer precision in bits.  Default is "&gt=1".

       rgba    Number of bits of red, green, blue, and alpha in the RGBA color
	       buffer.	Default is "&gt=1" for red, green, blue, and alpha capa-
	       bilities, and "=1" for the RGBA color model capability.

       rgb     Number of bits of red, green, and blue in the RGBA color buffer
	       and  zero  bits	of  alpha  color buffer precision.  Default is
	       "&gt=1" for the red, green, and blue capabilities, and  "~0"  for
	       alpha capability, and "=1" for the RGBA color model capability.

       stencil Number of bits in the stencil buffer.  Default is "~1".

       single  Boolean indicate the color buffer is single  buffered.	Double
	       buffer capability "=0".

       stereo  Boolean	indicating  the  color buffer is supports OpenGL-style
	       stereo.	Default is "=1".

       samples Indicates the number of samples to use based on GLX's SGIS_mul-
	       tisample extension (for antialiasing).  Default is "&lt=4".  This
	       default means that a GLUT application can request multisampling
	       if available by simply specifying "samples".

       slow    Boolean indicating if the frame buffer configuration is slow or
	       not.  Slowness information is based on GLX's  EXT_visual_rating
	       extension if supported.	If the extension is not supported, all
	       visuals are assumed fast.  Note that  slowness  is  a  relative
	       designation  relative  to  other  frame	buffer	configurations
	       available.  The intent of the slow capability is to  help  pro-
	       grams  avoid  frame  buffer configurations that are slower (but
	       perhaps higher precision) for the current machine.  Default  is
	       "&gt=0".	This default means that slow visuals are used in pref-
	       erence to fast visuals, but fast visuals will still be allowed.

       win32pfd
	       Only  recognized  on GLUT implementations for Win32, this capa-
	       bility name matches the Win32 Pixel Format Descriptor  by  num-
	       ber.  win32pfd requires a comparator and numeric value.

       xvisual Only  recognized  on GLUT implementations for the X Window Sys-
	       tem, this capability name matches the X visual  ID  by  number.
	       xvisual requires a comparator and numeric value.

       xstaticgray
	       Only  recognized  on GLUT implementations for the X Window Sys-
	       tem, boolean indicating if the frame buffer  configuration's  X
	       visual is of type StaticGray.  Default is "=1".

       xgrayscale
	       Only  recognized  on GLUT implementations for the X Window Sys-
	       tem, boolean indicating if the frame buffer  configuration's  X
	       visual is of type GrayScale.  Default is "=1".

       xstaticcolor
	       Only  recognized  on GLUT implementations for the X Window Sys-
	       tem, boolean indicating if the frame buffer  configuration's  X
	       visual is of type StaticColor.  Default is "=1".

       xpseudocolor
	       Only  recognized  on GLUT implementations for the X Window Sys-
	       tem, boolean indicating if the frame buffer  configuration's  X
	       visual is of type PsuedoColor.  Default is "=1".

       xtruecolor
	       Only  recognized  on GLUT implementations for the X Window Sys-
	       tem, boolean indicating if the frame buffer  configuration's  X
	       visual is of type TrueColor.  Default is "=1".

       xdirectcolor
	       Only  recognized  on GLUT implementations for the X Window Sys-
	       tem, boolean indicating if the frame buffer  configuration's  X
	       visual is of type DirectColor.  Default is "=1".

       Unspecified capability descriptions will result in unspecified criteria
       being generated.  These unspecified criteria help glutInitDisplayString
       behave sensibly with terse display mode description strings.

EXAMPLE
       Here is an example using glutInitDisplayString:

	 glutInitDisplayString("stencil~2 rgb double depth&gt=16 samples");

       The above call requests a window with an RGBA color model (but request-
       ing no bits of alpha), a depth buffer with at least 16 bits  of	preci-
       sion  but  preferring  more, multisampling if available, and at least 2
       bits of stencil (favoring less stencil to more as long as  2  bits  are
       available).
