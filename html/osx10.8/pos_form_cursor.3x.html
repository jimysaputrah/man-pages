NAME
       form_cursor - position a form window cursor

SYNOPSIS
       #include <form.h>
       int pos_form_cursor(FORM *form);

DESCRIPTION
       The  function  pos_form_cursor  restores  the  cursor  to  the position
       required for the forms driver to continue processing requests.  This is
       useful  after curses routines have been called to do screen-painting in
       response to a form operation.

RETURN VALUE
       This routine returns one of the following:

       E_OK The routine succeeded.

       E_BAD_ARGUMENT
	    Routine detected an incorrect or out-of-range argument.

       E_NOT_POSTED
	    The form has not been posted.

       E_SYSTEM_ERROR
	    System error occurred (see errno).

SEE ALSO
       curses(3X), form(3X).

NOTES
       The  header  file  <form.h>  automatically  includes  the  header  file
       <curses.h>.

PORTABILITY
       These  routines emulate the System V forms library.  They were not sup-
       ported on Version 7 or BSD versions.
