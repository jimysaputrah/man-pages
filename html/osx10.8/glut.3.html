NAME
       glut - an introduction to the OpenGL Utility Toolkit

SYNOPSIS
       #include &ltGLUT/glut.h&gt

       #include &ltGL/glut.h&gt

DESCRIPTION
       The  OpenGL Utility Toolkit (GLUT) is a programming interface with ANSI
       C and FORTRAN bindings for writing  window  system  independent	OpenGL
       programs. The toolkit supports the following functionality:

	      Multiple windows for OpenGL rendering.

	      Callback driven event processing.

	      Sophisticated input devices.

	      An ``idle'' routine and timers.

	      A simple, cascading pop-up menu facility.

	      Utility  routines  to  generate  various	solid  and  wire frame
	      objects.

	      Support for bitmap and stroke fonts.

	      Miscellaneous window management  functions,  including  managing
	      overlays.

       An  ANSI  C  implementation  of	GLUT  for the X Window System has been
       implemented by the author. Windows NT and OS/2  versions  of  GLUT  are
       also available.

BACKGROUND
       One of the major accomplishments in the specification of OpenGL was the
       isolation of window system dependencies from OpenGL's rendering	model.
       The result is that OpenGL is window system independent.

       Window system operations such as the creation of a rendering window and
       the handling of window system events are left to the native window sys-
       tem  to	define.  Necessary  interactions between OpenGL and the window
       system such as creating and binding an OpenGL context to a  window  are
       described  separately  from the OpenGL specification in a window system
       dependent specification. For example, the GLX  specification  describes
       the standard by which OpenGL interacts with the X Window System.

       The predecessor to OpenGL is IRIS GL. Unlike OpenGL, IRIS GL does spec-
       ify how rendering windows are created and manipulated. IRIS  GL's  win-
       dowing  interface is reasonably popular largely because it is simple to
       use. IRIS GL programmers can worry about graphics  programming  without
       needing to be an expert in programming the native window system.  Expe-
       rience also demonstrated that IRIS GL's windowing interface  was  high-
       level  enough  that it could be retargeted to different window systems.
       Silicon Graphics migrated from NeWS to the X Window System without  any
       major changes to IRIS GL's basic windowing interface.

       Removing  window  system  operations  from  OpenGL  is a sound decision
       because it allows the OpenGL graphics system to be retargeted to  vari-
       ous  systems  including powerful but expensive graphics workstations as
       well as mass-production graphics  systems  like	video  games,  set-top
       boxes for interactive television, and PCs.

       Unfortunately,  the  lack  of a window system interface for OpenGL is a
       gap in OpenGL's utility. Learning native window system APIs such as the
       X  Window  System's  Xlib or Motif can be daunting. Even those familiar
       with native window system APIs need to understand  the  interface  that
       binds OpenGL to the native window system. And when an OpenGL program is
       written using the native window system interface, despite the portabil-
       ity  of the program's OpenGL rendering code, the program itself will be
       window system dependent.

       Testing and documenting OpenGL's functionality lead to the  development
       of  the	tk  and  aux toolkits. The aux toolkit is used in the examples
       found in the OpenGL Programming Guide. Unfortunately, aux has  numerous
       limitations  and its utility is largely limited to toy programs. The tk
       library has more functionality than aux but was developed in an ad  hoc
       fashion	and still lacks much important functionality that IRIS GL pro-
       grammers expect, like pop-up menus and overlays.

       GLUT is designed to fill the need for a window system independent  pro-
       gramming interface for OpenGL programs. The interface is designed to be
       simple yet still meet the needs of  useful  OpenGL  programs.  Features
       from  the  IRIS GL, aux, and tk interfaces are included to make it easy
       for programmers used to these interfaces to develop programs for  GLUT.

PHILOSPHY
       GLUT  simplifies the implementation of programs using OpenGL rendering.
       The GLUT application programming interface (API) requires very few rou-
       tines  to  display a graphics scene rendered using OpenGL. The GLUT API
       (like the OpenGL API) is stateful. Most initial GLUT state  is  defined
       and the initial state is reasonable for simple programs.

       The  GLUT routines also take relatively few parameters. No pointers are
       returned. The only pointers passed into GLUT are pointers to  character
       strings	(all  strings  passed  to GLUT are copied, not referenced) and
       opaque font handles.

       The GLUT API is (as much as reasonable) window system independent.  For
       this  reason,  GLUT  does  not return any native window system handles,
       pointers, or other data structures. More subtle window system dependen-
       cies  such  as reliance on window system dependent fonts are avoided by
       GLUT; instead, GLUT supplies its own (limited) set of fonts.

       For programming ease, GLUT provides a simple menu  sub-API.  While  the
       menuing	support  is  designed  to be implemented as pop-up menus, GLUT
       gives window system leeway to support the menu functionality in another
       manner (pull-down menus for example).

       Two  of	the most important pieces of GLUT state are the current window
       and current menu. Most window and menu routines affect the current win-
       dow  or	menu  respectively.  Most callbacks implicitly set the current
       window and menu to the appropriate window or menu responsible  for  the
       callback.  GLUT is designed so that a program with only a single window
       and/or menu will not need to keep track of any window or  menu  identi-
       fiers.  This greatly simplifies very simple GLUT programs.

       GLUT  is  designed for simple to moderately complex programs focused on
       OpenGL rendering. GLUT implements its own event loop. For this  reason,
       mixing GLUT with other APIs that demand their own event handling struc-
       ture may be difficult. The advantage of a builtin event	dispatch  loop
       is simplicity.

       GLUT  contains routines for rendering fonts and geometric objects, how-
       ever GLUT makes no claims on the OpenGL display list  name  space.  For
       this  reason,  none  of	the GLUT rendering routines use OpenGL display
       lists. It is up to the GLUT programmer to compile the output from  GLUT
       rendering routines into display lists if this is desired.

       GLUT  routines  are logically organized into several sub-APIs according
       to their functionality. The sub-APIs are:

       Initialization.
	      Command line processing, window system initialization, and  ini-
	      tial window creation state are controlled by these routines.

       Beginning Event Processing.
	      This  routine  enters GLUT's event processing loop. This routine
	      never returns, and it continuously calls GLUT callbacks as  nec-
	      essary.

       Window Management.
	      These routines create and control windows.

       Overlay Management.
	      These routines establish and manage overlays for windows.

       Menu Management.
	      These routines create and control pop-up menus.

       Callback Registration.
	      These routines register callbacks to be called by the GLUT event
	      processing loop.

       Color Index Colormap Management.
	      These routines allow the manipulation of color  index  colormaps
	      for windows.

       State Retrieval.
	      These routines allows programs to retrieve state from GLUT.

       Font Rendering.
	      These routines allow rendering of stroke and bitmap fonts.

       Geometric Shape Rendering.
	      These  routines  allow  the  rendering  of  3D geometric objects
	      including spheres, cones, icosahedrons, and teapots.

CONVENTIONS
       GLUT window and screen coordinates are expressed in pixels.  The  upper
       left  hand  corner  of  the  screen or a window is (0,0). X coordinates
       increase in a rightward direction; Y coordinates increase in a downward
       direction.  Note:  This is inconsistent with OpenGL's coordinate scheme
       that generally considers the lower left hand coordinate of a window  to
       be at (0,0) but is consistent with most popular window systems.

       Integer identifiers in GLUT begin with one, not zero. So window identi-
       fiers, menu identifiers, and menu item indexes are based from one,  not
       zero.

       In  GLUT's  ANSI C binding, for most routines, basic types (int, char*)
       are used as parameters. In routines where the parameters  are  directly
       passed to OpenGL routines, OpenGL types (GLfloat) are used.

       The  header files for GLUT should be included in GLUT programs with the
       following include directive:

       #include &ltGL/glut.h&gt

       Because a very large window system software  vendor  (who  will	remain
       nameless)  has an apparent inability to appreciate that OpenGL's API is
       independent of their window system API, portable ANSI C	GLUT  programs
       should  not  directly  include &ltGL/gl.h&gt or &ltGL/glu.h&gt. Instead, ANSI C
       GLUT programs should rely  on  &ltGL/glut.h&gt  to  include	the  necessary
       OpenGL and GLU related header files.

       The  ANSI  C  GLUT library archive is typically named libglut.a on Unix
       systems. GLUT programs need to link with the system's OpenGL  and  GLUT
       libraries  (and any libraries these libraries potentially depend on). A
       set of window system dependent libraries  may  also  be	necessary  for
       linking	GLUT programs. For example, programs using the X11 GLUT imple-
       mentation typically need to link with Xlib, the	X  extension  library,
       possibly  the  X Input extension library, the X miscellaneous utilities
       library, and the math library. An example X11/Unix compile  line  would
       look like:

       cc -o foo foo.c -lglut -lGLU -lGL -lXmu -lXi -lXext -lX11 -lm
