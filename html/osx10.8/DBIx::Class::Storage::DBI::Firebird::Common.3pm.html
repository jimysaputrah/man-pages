NAME
       DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::Firebird::Common - Driver Base Class for the
       Firebird RDBMS

DESCRIPTION
       This class implements autoincrements for Firebird using "RETURNING" as
       well as auto_nextval, savepoints and server version detection.

CAVEATS
       o   "last_insert_id" support by default only works for Firebird
	   versions 2 or greater, auto_nextval however should work with
	   earlier versions.
