NAME
       Path::Class - Cross-platform path specification manipulation

VERSION
       version 0.24

SYNOPSIS
	 use Path::Class;

	 my $dir  = dir('foo', 'bar');	     # Path::Class::Dir object
	 my $file = file('bob', 'file.txt'); # Path::Class::File object

	 # Stringifies to 'foo/bar' on Unix, 'foo\bar' on Windows, etc.
	 print "dir: $dir\n";

	 # Stringifies to 'bob/file.txt' on Unix, 'bob\file.txt' on Windows
	 print "file: $file\n";

	 my $subdir  = $dir-&gtsubdir('baz');  # foo/bar/baz
	 my $parent  = $subdir-&gtparent;      # foo/bar
	 my $parent2 = $parent-&gtparent;      # foo

	 my $dir2 = $file-&gtdir; 	     # bob

	 # Work with foreign paths
	 use Path::Class qw(foreign_file foreign_dir);
	 my $file = foreign_file('Mac', ':foo:file.txt');
	 print $file-&gtdir;		     # :foo:
	 print $file-&gtas_foreign('Win32');   # foo\file.txt

	 # Interact with the underlying filesystem:

	 # $dir_handle is an IO::Dir object
	 my $dir_handle = $dir-&gtopen or die "Can't read $dir: $!";

	 # $file_handle is an IO::File object
	 my $file_handle = $file-&gtopen($mode) or die "Can't read $file: $!";

DESCRIPTION
       "Path::Class" is a module for manipulation of file and directory
       specifications (strings describing their locations, like
       '/home/ken/foo.txt' or 'C:\Windows\Foo.txt') in a cross-platform
       manner.	It supports pretty much every platform Perl runs on, including
       Unix, Windows, Mac, VMS, Epoc, Cygwin, OS/2, and NetWare.

       The well-known module "File::Spec" also provides this service, but it's
       sort of awkward to use well, so people sometimes avoid it, or use it in
       a way that won't actually work properly on platforms significantly
       different than the ones they've tested their code on.

       In fact, "Path::Class" uses "File::Spec" internally, wrapping all the
       unsightly details so you can concentrate on your application code.
       Whereas "File::Spec" provides functions for some common path
       manipulations, "Path::Class" provides an object-oriented model of the
       world of path specifications and their underlying semantics.
       "File::Spec" doesn't create any objects, and its classes represent the
       different ways in which paths must be manipulated on various platforms
       (not a very intuitive concept).	"Path::Class" creates objects
       representing files and directories, and provides methods that relate
       them to each other.  For instance, the following "File::Spec" code:

	my $absolute = File::Spec-&gtfile_name_is_absolute(
			 File::Spec-&gtcatfile( @dirs, $file )
		       );

       can be written using "Path::Class" as

	my $absolute = Path::Class::File-&gtnew( @dirs, $file )-&gtis_absolute;

       or even as

	my $absolute = file( @dirs, $file )-&gtis_absolute;

       Similar readability improvements should happen all over the place when
       using "Path::Class".

       Using "Path::Class" can help solve real problems in your code too - for
       instance, how many people actually take the "volume" (like "C:" on
       Windows) into account when writing "File::Spec"-using code?  I thought
       not.  But if you use "Path::Class", your file and directory objects
       will know what volumes they refer to and do the right thing.

       The guts of the "Path::Class" code live in the "Path::Class::File" and
       "Path::Class::Dir" modules, so please see those modules' documentation
       for more details about how to use them.

   EXPORT
       The following functions are exported by default.

       file
	   A synonym for "Path::Class::File-&gtnew".

       dir A synonym for "Path::Class::Dir-&gtnew".

       If you would like to prevent their export, you may explicitly pass an
       empty list to perl's "use", i.e. "use Path::Class ()".

       The following are exported only on demand.

       foreign_file
	   A synonym for "Path::Class::File-&gtnew_foreign".

       foreign_dir
	   A synonym for "Path::Class::Dir-&gtnew_foreign".

Notes on Cross-Platform Compatibility
       Although it is much easier to write cross-platform-friendly code with
       this module than with "File::Spec", there are still some issues to be
       aware of.

       o   Some platforms, notably VMS and some older versions of DOS (I
	   think), all filenames must have an extension.  Thus if you create a
	   file called foo/bar and then ask for a list of files in the
	   directory foo, you may find a file called bar. instead of the bar
	   you were expecting.	Thus it might be a good idea to use an
	   extension in the first place.
