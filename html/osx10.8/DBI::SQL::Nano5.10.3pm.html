DBI::SQL::Nano(3)     User Contributed Perl Documentation    DBI::SQL::Nano(3)



NAME
       DBI::SQL::Nano - a very tiny SQL engine

SYNOPSIS
	BEGIN { $ENV{DBI_SQL_NANO}=1 } # forces use of Nano rather than SQL::Statement
	use DBI::SQL::Nano;
	use Data::Dumper;
	my $stmt = DBI::SQL::Nano::Statement-&gtnew(
	    "SELECT bar,baz FROM foo WHERE qux = 1"
	) or die "Couldn't parse";
	print Dumper $stmt;

DESCRIPTION
       DBI::SQL::Nano is meant as a *very* minimal SQL engine for use in
       situations where SQL::Statement is not available.  In most situations
       you are better off installing SQL::Statement although DBI::SQL::Nano
       may be faster for some very simple tasks.

       DBI::SQL::Nano, like SQL::Statement is primarily intended to provide a
       SQL engine for use with some pure perl DBDs including DBD::DBM,
       DBD::CSV, DBD::AnyData, and DBD::Excel.	It isn't of much use in and of
       itself.	You can dump out the structure of a parsed SQL statement, but
       that's about it.

USAGE
   Setting the DBI_SQL_NANO flag
       By default, when a DBD uses DBI::SQL::Nano, the module will look to see
       if SQL::Statement is installed.	If it is, SQL::Statement objects are
       used.  If SQL::Statement is not available, DBI::SQL::Nano objects are
       used.

       In some cases, you may wish to use DBI::SQL::Nano objects even if
       SQL::Statement is available.  To force usage of DBI::SQL::Nano objects
       regardless of the availability of SQL::Statement, set the environment
       variable DBI_SQL_NANO to 1.

       You can set the environment variable in your shell prior to running
       your script (with SET or EXPORT or whatever), or else you can set it in
       your script by putting this at the top of the script:

	BEGIN { $ENV{DBI_SQL_NANO} = 1 }

   Supported SQL syntax
	Here's a pseudo-BNF.  Square brackets [] indicate optional items;
	Angle brackets &lt&gt indicate items defined elsewhere in the BNF.

	 statement ::=
	     DROP TABLE [IF EXISTS] &lttable_name&gt
	   | CREATE TABLE &lttable_name&gt &ltcol_def_list&gt
	   | INSERT INTO &lttable_name&gt [&ltinsert_col_list&gt] VALUES &ltval_list&gt
	   | DELETE FROM &lttable_name&gt [&ltwhere_clause&gt]
	   | UPDATE &lttable_name&gt SET &ltset_clause&gt &ltwhere_clause&gt
	   | SELECT &ltselect_col_list&gt FROM &lttable_name&gt [&ltwhere_clause&gt]
							[&ltorder_clause&gt]

	 the optional IF EXISTS clause ::=
	   * similar to MySQL - prevents errors when trying to drop
	     a table that doesn't exist

	 identifiers ::=
	   * table and column names should be valid SQL identifiers
	   * especially avoid using spaces and commas in identifiers
	   * note: there is no error checking for invalid names, some
	     will be accepted, others will cause parse failures

	 table_name ::=
	   * only one table (no multiple table operations)
	   * see identifier for valid table names

	 col_def_list ::=
	   * a parens delimited, comma-separated list of column names
	   * see identifier for valid column names
	   * column types and column constraints may be included but are ignored
	     e.g. these are all the same:
	       (id,phrase)
	       (id INT, phrase VARCHAR(40))
	       (id INT PRIMARY KEY, phrase VARCHAR(40) NOT NULL)
	   * you are *strongly* advised to put in column types even though
	     they are ignored ... it increases portability

	 insert_col_list ::=
	   * a parens delimited, comma-separated list of column names
	   * as in standard SQL, this is optional

	 select_col_list ::=
	   * a comma-separated list of column names
	   * or an asterisk denoting all columns

	 val_list ::=
	   * a parens delimited, comma-separated list of values which can be:
	      * placeholders (an unquoted question mark)
	      * numbers (unquoted numbers)
	      * column names (unquoted strings)
	      * nulls (unquoted word NULL)
	      * strings (delimited with single quote marks);
	      * note: leading and trailing percent mark (%) and underscore (_)
		can be used as wildcards in quoted strings for use with
		the LIKE and CLIKE operators
	      * note: escaped single quote marks within strings are not
		supported, neither are embedded commas, use placeholders instead

	 set_clause ::=
	   * a comma-separated list of column = value pairs
	   * see val_list for acceptable value formats

	 where_clause ::=
	   * a single "column/value &ltop&gt column/value" predicate, optionally
	     preceded by "NOT"
	   * note: multiple predicates combined with ORs or ANDs are not supported
	   * see val_list for acceptable value formats
	   * op may be one of:
		&lt &gt &gt= &lt= = &lt&gt LIKE CLIKE IS
	   * CLIKE is a case insensitive LIKE

	 order_clause ::= column_name [ASC|DESC]
	   * a single column optional ORDER BY clause is supported
	   * as in standard SQL, if neither ASC (ascending) nor
	     DESC (descending) is specified, ASC becomes the default

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
       Tim Bunce provided the original idea for this module, helped me out of
       the tangled trap of namespace, and provided help and advice all along
       the way.  Although I wrote it from the ground up, it is based on Jochen
       Weidmann's orignal design of SQL::Statement, so much of the credit for
       the API goes to him.
