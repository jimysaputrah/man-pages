NAME
       Pod::Simple::XHTML -- format Pod as validating XHTML

SYNOPSIS
	 use Pod::Simple::XHTML;

	 my $parser = Pod::Simple::XHTML->new();

	 ...

	 $parser->parse_file('path/to/file.pod');

DESCRIPTION
       This class is a formatter that takes Pod and renders it as XHTML
       validating HTML.

       This is a subclass of Pod::Simple::Methody and inherits all its
       methods. The implementation is entirely different than
       Pod::Simple::HTML, but it largely preserves the same interface.

METHODS
       Pod::Simple::XHTML offers a number of methods that modify the format of
       the HTML output. Call these after creating the parser object, but
       before the call to "parse_file":

	 my $parser = Pod::PseudoPod::HTML->new();
	 $parser->set_optional_param("value");
	 $parser->parse_file($file);

   perldoc_url_prefix
       In turning Foo::Bar into http://whatever/Foo%3a%3aBar, what to put
       before the "Foo%3a%3aBar". The default value is
       "http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?".

   perldoc_url_postfix
       What to put after "Foo%3a%3aBar" in the URL. This option is not set by
       default.

   title_prefix, title_postfix
       What to put before and after the title in the head. The values should
       already be &-escaped.

   html_css
	 $parser->html_css('path/to/style.css');

       The URL or relative path of a CSS file to include. This option is not
       set by default.

   html_javascript
       The URL or relative path of a JavaScript file to pull in. This option
       is not set by default.

   html_doctype
       A document type tag for the file. This option is not set by default.

   html_header_tags
       Additional arbitrary HTML tags for the header of the document. The
       default value is just a content type header tag:

	 <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1">

       Add additional meta tags here, or blocks of inline CSS or JavaScript
       (wrapped in the appropriate tags).

   default_title
       Set a default title for the page if no title can be determined from the
       content. The value of this string should already be &-escaped.

   force_title
       Force a title for the page (don't try to determine it from the
       content).  The value of this string should already be &-escaped.

   html_header, html_footer
       Set the HTML output at the beginning and end of each file. The default
       header includes a title, a doctype tag (if "html_doctype" is set), a
       content tag (customized by "html_header_tags"), a tag for a CSS file
       (if "html_css" is set), and a tag for a Javascript file (if
       "html_javascript" is set). The default footer simply closes the "html"
       and "body" tags.

       The options listed above customize parts of the default header, but
       setting "html_header" or "html_footer" completely overrides the built-
       in header or footer. These may be useful if you want to use template
       tags instead of literal HTML headers and footers or are integrating
       converted POD pages in a larger website.

       If you want no headers or footers output in the HTML, set these options
       to the empty string.

   index
       TODO -- Not implemented.

       Whether to add a table-of-contents at the top of each page (called an
       index for the sake of tradition).

SUBCLASSING
       If the standard options aren't enough, you may want to subclass
       Pod::Simple::XHMTL. These are the most likely candidates for methods
       you'll want to override when subclassing.

   handle_text
       This method handles the body of text within any element: it's the body
       of a paragraph, or everything between a "=begin" tag and the
       corresponding "=end" tag, or the text within an L entity, etc. You
       would want to override this if you are adding a custom element type
       that does more than just display formatted text. Perhaps adding a way
       to generate HTML tables from an extended version of POD.

       So, let's say you want add a custom element called 'foo'. In your
       subclass's "new" method, after calling "SUPER::new" you'd call:

	 $new->accept_targets_as_text( 'foo' );

       Then override the "start_for" method in the subclass to check for when
       "$flags->{'target'}" is equal to 'foo' and set a flag that marks that
       you're in a foo block (maybe "$self->{'in_foo'} = 1"). Then override
       the "handle_text" method to check for the flag, and pass $text to your
       custom subroutine to construct the HTML output for 'foo' elements,
       something like:

	 sub handle_text {
	     my ($self, $text) = @_;
	     if ($self->{'in_foo'}) {
		 $self->{'scratch'} .= build_foo_html($text);
	     } else {
		 $self->{'scratch'} .= $text;
	     }
	 }
