NAME
       ExtUtils::Manifest - utilities to write and check a MANIFEST file

SYNOPSIS
	   use ExtUtils::Manifest qw(...funcs to import...);

	   mkmanifest();

	   my @missing_files	= manicheck;
	   my @skipped		= skipcheck;
	   my @extra_files	= filecheck;
	   my($missing, $extra) = fullcheck;

	   my $found	= manifind();

	   my $manifest = maniread();

	   manicopy($read,$target);

	   maniadd({$file =&gt $comment, ...});

DESCRIPTION
   Functions
       ExtUtils::Manifest exports no functions by default.  The following are
       exported on request

       mkmanifest
	       mkmanifest();

	   Writes all files in and below the current directory to your
	   MANIFEST.  It works similar to the result of the Unix command

	       find . &gt MANIFEST

	   All files that match any regular expression in a file MANIFEST.SKIP
	   (if it exists) are ignored.

	   Any existing MANIFEST file will be saved as MANIFEST.bak.

       manifind
	       my $found = manifind();

	   returns a hash reference. The keys of the hash are the files found
	   below the current directory.

       manicheck
	       my @missing_files = manicheck();

	   checks if all the files within a "MANIFEST" in the current
	   directory really do exist. If "MANIFEST" and the tree below the
	   current directory are in sync it silently returns an empty list.
	   Otherwise it returns a list of files which are listed in the
	   "MANIFEST" but missing from the directory, and by default also
	   outputs these names to STDERR.

       filecheck
	       my @extra_files = filecheck();

	   finds files below the current directory that are not mentioned in
	   the "MANIFEST" file. An optional file "MANIFEST.SKIP" will be
	   consulted. Any file matching a regular expression in such a file
	   will not be reported as missing in the "MANIFEST" file. The list of
	   any extraneous files found is returned, and by default also
	   reported to STDERR.

       fullcheck
	       my($missing, $extra) = fullcheck();

	   does both a manicheck() and a filecheck(), returning then as two
	   array refs.

       skipcheck
	       my @skipped = skipcheck();

	   lists all the files that are skipped due to your "MANIFEST.SKIP"
	   file.

       maniread
	       my $manifest = maniread();
	       my $manifest = maniread($manifest_file);

	   reads a named "MANIFEST" file (defaults to "MANIFEST" in the
	   current directory) and returns a HASH reference with files being
	   the keys and comments being the values of the HASH.	Blank lines
	   and lines which start with "#" in the "MANIFEST" file are
	   discarded.

       maniskip
	       my $skipchk = maniskip();
	       my $skipchk = maniskip($manifest_skip_file);

	       if ($skipchk-&gt($file)) { .. }

	   reads a named "MANIFEST.SKIP" file (defaults to "MANIFEST.SKIP" in
	   the current directory) and returns a CODE reference that tests
	   whether a given filename should be skipped.

       manicopy
	       manicopy(\%src, $dest_dir);
	       manicopy(\%src, $dest_dir, $how);

	   Copies the files that are the keys in %src to the $dest_dir.  %src
	   is typically returned by the maniread() function.

	       manicopy( maniread(), $dest_dir );

	   This function is useful for producing a directory tree identical to
	   the intended distribution tree.

	   $how can be used to specify a different methods of "copying".
	   Valid values are "cp", which actually copies the files, "ln" which
	   creates hard links, and "best" which mostly links the files but
	   copies any symbolic link to make a tree without any symbolic link.
	   "cp" is the default.

       maniadd
	     maniadd({ $file =&gt $comment, ...});

	   Adds an entry to an existing MANIFEST unless its already there.

	   $file will be normalized (ie. Unixified).  UNIMPLEMENTED

   MANIFEST
       A list of files in the distribution, one file per line.	The MANIFEST
       always uses Unix filepath conventions even if you're not on Unix.  This
       means foo/bar style not foo\bar.

       Anything between white space and an end of line within a "MANIFEST"
       file is considered to be a comment.  Any line beginning with # is also
       a comment. Beginning with ExtUtils::Manifest 1.52, a filename may
       contain whitespace characters if it is enclosed in single quotes;
       single quotes or backslashes in that filename must be backslash-
       escaped.

	   # this a comment
	   some/file
	   some/other/file	      comment about some/file
	   'some/third file'	      comment

   MANIFEST.SKIP
       The file MANIFEST.SKIP may contain regular expressions of files that
       should be ignored by mkmanifest() and filecheck(). The regular
       expressions should appear one on each line. Blank lines and lines which
       start with "#" are skipped.  Use "\#" if you need a regular expression
       to start with a "#".

       For example:

	   # Version control files and dirs.
	   \bRCS\b
	   \bCVS\b
	   ,v$
	   \B\.svn\b

	   # Makemaker generated files and dirs.
	   ^MANIFEST\.
	   ^Makefile$
	   ^blib/
	   ^MakeMaker-\d

	   # Temp, old and emacs backup files.
	   ~$
	   \.old$
	   ^#.*#$
	   ^\.#

       If no MANIFEST.SKIP file is found, a default set of skips will be used,
       similar to the example above.  If you want nothing skipped, simply make
       an empty MANIFEST.SKIP file.

       In one's own MANIFEST.SKIP file, certain directives can be used to
       include the contents of other MANIFEST.SKIP files. At present two such
       directives are recognized.

       #!include_default
	   This inserts the contents of the default MANIFEST.SKIP file

       #!include /Path/to/another/manifest.skip
	   This inserts the contents of the specified external file

       The included contents will be inserted into the MANIFEST.SKIP file in
       between #!start included /path/to/manifest.skip and #!end included
       /path/to/manifest.skip markers.	The original MANIFEST.SKIP is saved as
       MANIFEST.SKIP.bak.

   EXPORT_OK
       &mkmanifest, &manicheck, &filecheck, &fullcheck, &maniread, and
       &manicopy are exportable.

   GLOBAL VARIABLES
       $ExtUtils::Manifest::MANIFEST defaults to "MANIFEST". Changing it
       results in both a different "MANIFEST" and a different "MANIFEST.SKIP"
       file. This is useful if you want to maintain different distributions
       for different audiences (say a user version and a developer version
       including RCS).

       $ExtUtils::Manifest::Quiet defaults to 0. If set to a true value, all
       functions act silently.

       $ExtUtils::Manifest::Debug defaults to 0.  If set to a true value, or
       if PERL_MM_MANIFEST_DEBUG is true, debugging output will be produced.

DIAGNOSTICS
       All diagnostic output is sent to "STDERR".

       "Not in MANIFEST:" file
	   is reported if a file is found which is not in "MANIFEST".

       "Skipping" file
	   is reported if a file is skipped due to an entry in
	   "MANIFEST.SKIP".

       "No such file:" file
	   is reported if a file mentioned in a "MANIFEST" file does not
	   exist.

       "MANIFEST:" $!
	   is reported if "MANIFEST" could not be opened.

       "Added to MANIFEST:" file
	   is reported by mkmanifest() if $Verbose is set and a file is added
	   to MANIFEST. $Verbose is set to 1 by default.

ENVIRONMENT
       PERL_MM_MANIFEST_DEBUG
	   Turns on debugging
