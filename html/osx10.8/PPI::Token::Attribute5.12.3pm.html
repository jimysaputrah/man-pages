PPI::Token::Attribute(User Contributed Perl DocumentatPPI::Token::Attribute(3)



NAME
       PPI::Token::Attribute - A token for a subroutine attribute

INHERITANCE
	 PPI::Token::Attribute
	 isa PPI::Token
	     isa PPI::Element

DESCRIPTION
       In Perl, attributes are a relatively recent addition to the language.

       Given the code " sub foo : bar(something) {} ", the "bar(something)"
       part is the attribute.

       A "PPI::Token::Attribute" token represents the entire of the attribute,
       as the braces and its contents are not parsed into the tree, and are
       treated by Perl (and thus by us) as a single string.

METHODS
       This class provides some additional methods beyond those provided by
       its PPI::Token and PPI::Element parent classes.

       Got any ideas for methods? Submit a report to rt.cpan.org!

   identifier
       The "identifier" attribute returns the identifier part of the
       attribute.

       That is, for the attribute "foo(bar)", the "identifier" method would
       return "foo".

   parameters
       The "parameters" method returns the parameter strong for the attribute.

       That is, for the attribute "foo(bar)", the "parameters" method would
       return "bar".

       Returns the parameters as a string (including the null string '' for
       the case of an attribute such as "foo()".

       Returns "undef" if the attribute does not have parameters.

SUPPORT
       See the support section in the main module.
