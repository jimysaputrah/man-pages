Module::Load(3pm)      Perl Programmers Reference Guide      Module::Load(3pm)



NAME
       Module::Load - runtime require of both modules and files

SYNOPSIS
	       use Module::Load;

	   my $module = 'Data:Dumper';
	   load Data::Dumper;	   # loads that module
	   load 'Data::Dumper';    # ditto
	   load $module 	   # tritto

	   my $script = 'some/script.pl'
	   load $script;
	   load 'some/script.pl';      # use quotes because of punctuations

	   load thing;		   # try 'thing' first, then 'thing.pm'

	   load CGI, ':standard'   # like 'use CGI qw[:standard]'

DESCRIPTION
       "load" eliminates the need to know whether you are trying to require
       either a file or a module.

       If you consult "perldoc -f require" you will see that "require" will
       behave differently when given a bareword or a string.

       In the case of a string, "require" assumes you are wanting to load a
       file. But in the case of a bareword, it assumes you mean a module.

       This gives nasty overhead when you are trying to dynamically require
       modules at runtime, since you will need to change the module notation
       ("Acme::Comment") to a file notation fitting the particular platform
       you are on.

       "load" eliminates the need for this overhead and will just DWYM.

Rules
       "load" has the following rules to decide what it thinks you want:

       o   If the argument has any characters in it other than those matching
	   "\w", ":" or "'", it must be a file

       o   If the argument matches only "[\w:']", it must be a module

       o   If the argument matches only "\w", it could either be a module or a
	   file. We will try to find "file" first in @INC and if that fails,
	   we will try to find "file.pm" in @INC.  If both fail, we die with
	   the respective error messages.

Caveats
       Because of a bug in perl (#19213), at least in version 5.6.1, we have
       to hardcode the path separator for a require on Win32 to be "/", like
       on Unix rather than the Win32 "\". Otherwise perl will not read its own
       %INC accurately double load files if they are required again, or in the
       worst case, core dump.

       "Module::Load" cannot do implicit imports, only explicit imports.  (in
       other words, you always have to specify explicitly what you wish to
       import from a module, even if the functions are in that modules'
       @EXPORT)

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
       Thanks to Jonas B. Nielsen for making explicit imports work.
