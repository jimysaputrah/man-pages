SPI_FINISH(3)		PostgreSQL 9.1.4 Documentation		 SPI_FINISH(3)



NAME
       SPI_finish - disconnect a procedure from the SPI manager

SYNOPSIS
       int SPI_finish(void)

DESCRIPTION
       SPI_finish closes an existing connection to the SPI manager. You must
       call this function after completing the SPI operations needed during
       your procedure's current invocation. You do not need to worry about
       making this happen, however, if you abort the transaction via
       elog(ERROR). In that case SPI will clean itself up automatically.

       If SPI_finish is called without having a valid connection, it will
       return SPI_ERROR_UNCONNECTED. There is no fundamental problem with
       this; it means that the SPI manager has nothing to do.

RETURN VALUE
       SPI_OK_FINISH
	   if properly disconnected

       SPI_ERROR_UNCONNECTED
	   if called from an unconnected procedure
