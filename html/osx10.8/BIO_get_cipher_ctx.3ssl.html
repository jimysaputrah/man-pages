NAME
       BIO_f_cipher, BIO_set_cipher, BIO_get_cipher_status, BIO_get_cipher_ctx
       - cipher BIO filter

SYNOPSIS
	#include <openssl/bio.h>
	#include <openssl/evp.h>

	BIO_METHOD *   BIO_f_cipher(void);
	void BIO_set_cipher(BIO *b,const EVP_CIPHER *cipher,
		       unsigned char *key, unsigned char *iv, int enc);
	int BIO_get_cipher_status(BIO *b)
	int BIO_get_cipher_ctx(BIO *b, EVP_CIPHER_CTX **pctx)

DESCRIPTION
       BIO_f_cipher() returns the cipher BIO method. This is a filter BIO that
       encrypts any data written through it, and decrypts any data read from
       it. It is a BIO wrapper for the cipher routines EVP_CipherInit(),
       EVP_CipherUpdate() and EVP_CipherFinal().

       Cipher BIOs do not support BIO_gets() or BIO_puts().

       BIO_flush() on an encryption BIO that is being written through is used
       to signal that no more data is to be encrypted: this is used to flush
       and possibly pad the final block through the BIO.

       BIO_set_cipher() sets the cipher of BIO b to cipher using key key and
       IV iv. enc should be set to 1 for encryption and zero for decryption.

       When reading from an encryption BIO the final block is automatically
       decrypted and checked when EOF is detected. BIO_get_cipher_status() is
       a BIO_ctrl() macro which can be called to determine whether the
       decryption operation was successful.

       BIO_get_cipher_ctx() is a BIO_ctrl() macro which retrieves the internal
       BIO cipher context. The retrieved context can be used in conjunction
       with the standard cipher routines to set it up. This is useful when
       BIO_set_cipher() is not flexible enough for the applications needs.

NOTES
       When encrypting BIO_flush() must be called to flush the final block
       through the BIO. If it is not then the final block will fail a
       subsequent decrypt.

       When decrypting an error on the final block is signalled by a zero
       return value from the read operation. A successful decrypt followed by
       EOF will also return zero for the final read. BIO_get_cipher_status()
       should be called to determine if the decrypt was successful.

       As always, if BIO_gets() or BIO_puts() support is needed then it can be
       achieved by preceding the cipher BIO with a buffering BIO.

RETURN VALUES
       BIO_f_cipher() returns the cipher BIO method.

       BIO_set_cipher() does not return a value.

       BIO_get_cipher_status() returns 1 for a successful decrypt and 0 for
       failure.

       BIO_get_cipher_ctx() currently always returns 1.
