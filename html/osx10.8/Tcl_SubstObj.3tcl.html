NAME
       Tcl_SubstObj - perform substitutions on Tcl objects

SYNOPSIS
       #include <tcl.h>

       Tcl_Obj *
       Tcl_SubstObj(interp, objPtr, flags)

ARGUMENTS
       Tcl_Interp *interp (in)		  Interpreter  in which to execute Tcl
					  scripts and lookup variables.  If an
					  error   occurs,   the  interpreter's
					  result is modified to hold an  error
					  message.

       Tcl_Obj *objPtr (in)		  A  Tcl  object containing the string
					  to perform substitutions on.

       int flags (in)			  ORed combination of flag  bits  that
					  specify  which substitutions to per-
					  form.  The flags TCL_SUBST_COMMANDS,
					  TCL_SUBST_VARIABLES		   and
					  TCL_SUBST_BACKSLASHES are  currently
					  supported, and TCL_SUBST_ALL is pro-
					  vided as a convenience for the  com-
					  mon case where all substitutions are
					  desired.

DESCRIPTION
       The Tcl_SubstObj function is used to perform substitutions  on  strings
       in  the	fashion of the subst command.  It gets the value of the string
       contained in objPtr and scans it, copying characters and performing the
       chosen  substitutions  as it goes to an output object which is returned
       as the result of the function.  In the event of an error occurring dur-
       ing  the  execution of a command or variable substitution, the function
       returns NULL and an error message is left in interp's result.

       Three kinds of substitutions are supported.  When  the  TCL_SUBST_BACK-
       SLASHES bit is set in flags, sequences that look like backslash substi-
       tutions for Tcl commands are replaced by their corresponding character.

       When  the  TCL_SUBST_VARIABLES bit is set in flags, sequences that look
       like variable substitutions for Tcl commands are replaced by  the  con-
       tents of the named variable.

       When  the  TCL_SUBST_COMMANDS  bit is set in flags, sequences that look
       like command substitutions for Tcl commands are replaced by the	result
       of  evaluating  that  script.   Where  an uncaught "continue exception"
       occurs during the evaluation of a command substitution, an empty string
       is  substituted	for  the command.  Where an uncaught "break exception"
       occurs during the evaluation of a command substitution, the  result  of
       the whole substitution on objPtr will be truncated at the point immedi-
       ately before the start of the command substitution, and	no  characters
       will  be  added	to  the  result  or substitutions performed after that
       point.
