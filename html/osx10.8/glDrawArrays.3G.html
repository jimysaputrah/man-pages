NAME
       glDrawArrays - render primitives from array data

C SPECIFICATION
       void glDrawArrays(GLenum mode, GLint first, GLsizei count);

PARAMETERS
       mode
	   Specifies what kind of primitives to render. Symbolic constants
	   GL_POINTS, GL_LINE_STRIP, GL_LINE_LOOP, GL_LINES,
	   GL_LINE_STRIP_ADJACENCY, GL_LINES_ADJACENCY, GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP,
	   GL_TRIANGLE_FAN, GL_TRIANGLES, GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP_ADJACENCY and
	   GL_TRIANGLES_ADJACENCY are accepted.

       first
	   Specifies the starting index in the enabled arrays.

       count
	   Specifies the number of indices to be rendered.

DESCRIPTION
       glDrawArrays specifies multiple geometric primitives with very few
       subroutine calls. Instead of calling a GL procedure to pass each
       individual vertex, normal, texture coordinate, edge flag, or color, you
       can prespecify separate arrays of vertices, normals, and colors and use
       them to construct a sequence of primitives with a single call to
       glDrawArrays.

       When glDrawArrays is called, it uses count sequential elements from
       each enabled array to construct a sequence of geometric primitives,
       beginning with element first.  mode specifies what kind of primitives
       are constructed and how the array elements construct those primitives.

       Vertex attributes that are modified by glDrawArrays have an unspecified
       value after glDrawArrays returns. Attributes that aren't modified
       remain well defined.

NOTES
       GL_LINE_STRIP_ADJACENCY, GL_LINES_ADJACENCY,
       GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP_ADJACENCY and GL_TRIANGLES_ADJACENCY are available
       only if the GL version is 3.2 or greater.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if mode is not an accepted value.


       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if count is negative.


       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if a non-zero buffer object name is
       bound to an enabled array and the buffer object's data store is
       currently mapped.


       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if a geometry shader is active and
       mode is incompatible with the input primitive type of the geometry
       shader in the currently installed program object.
