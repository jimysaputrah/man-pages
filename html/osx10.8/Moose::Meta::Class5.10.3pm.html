NAME
       Moose::Meta::Class - The Moose metaclass

DESCRIPTION
       This class is a subclass of Class::MOP::Class that provides additional
       Moose-specific functionality.

       To really understand this class, you will need to start with the
       Class::MOP::Class documentation. This class can be understood as a set
       of additional features on top of the basic feature provided by that
       parent class.

INHERITANCE
       "Moose::Meta::Class" is a subclass of Class::MOP::Class.

METHODS
       Moose::Meta::Class->initialize($package_name, %options)
	   This overrides the parent's method in order to provide its own
	   defaults for the "attribute_metaclass", "instance_metaclass", and
	   "method_metaclass" options.

	   These all default to the appropriate Moose class.

       Moose::Meta::Class->create($package_name, %options)
	   This overrides the parent's method in order to accept a "roles"
	   option. This should be an array reference containing roles that the
	   class does, each optionally followed by a hashref of options
	   ("-excludes" and "-alias").

	     my $metaclass = Moose::Meta::Class->create( 'New::Class', roles => [...] );

       Moose::Meta::Class->create_anon_class
	   This overrides the parent's method to accept a "roles" option, just
	   as "create" does.

	   It also accepts a "cache" option. If this is true, then the
	   anonymous class will be cached based on its superclasses and roles.
	   If an existing anonymous class in the cache has the same
	   superclasses and roles, it will be reused.

	     my $metaclass = Moose::Meta::Class->create_anon_class(
		 superclasses => ['Foo'],
		 roles	      => [qw/Some Roles Go Here/],
		 cache	      => 1,
	     );

       $metaclass->make_immutable(%options)
	   This overrides the parent's method to add a few options.
	   Specifically, it uses the Moose-specific constructor and destructor
	   classes, and enables inlining the destructor.

	   Also, since Moose always inlines attributes, it sets the
	   "inline_accessors" option to false.

       $metaclass->new_object(%params)
	   This overrides the parent's method in order to add support for
	   attribute triggers.

       $metaclass->add_override_method_modifier($name, $sub)
	   This adds an "override" method modifier to the package.

       $metaclass->add_augment_method_modifier($name, $sub)
	   This adds an "augment" method modifier to the package.

       $metaclass->calculate_all_roles
	   This will return a unique array of "Moose::Meta::Role" instances
	   which are attached to this class.

       $metaclass->add_role($role)
	   This takes a Moose::Meta::Role object, and adds it to the class's
	   list of roles. This does not actually apply the role to the class.

       $metaclass->role_applications
	   Returns a list of Moose::Meta::Role::Application::ToClass objects,
	   which contain the arguments to role application.

       $metaclass->add_role_application($application)
	   This takes a Moose::Meta::Role::Application::ToClass object, and
	   adds it to the class's list of role applications. This does not
	   actually apply any role to the class; it is only for tracking role
	   applications.

       $metaclass->does_role($role)
	   This returns a boolean indicating whether or not the class does the
	   specified role. The role provided can be either a role name or a
	   Moose::Meta::Role object. This tests both the class and its
	   parents.

       $metaclass->excludes_role($role_name)
	   A class excludes a role if it has already composed a role which
	   excludes the named role. This tests both the class and its parents.

       $metaclass->add_attribute($attr_name, %params|$params)
	   This overrides the parent's method in order to allow the parameters
	   to be provided as a hash reference.

       $metaclass->constructor_class ($class_name)
       $metaclass->destructor_class ($class_name)
	   These are the names of classes used when making a class immutable.
	   These default to Moose::Meta::Method::Constructor and
	   Moose::Meta::Method::Destructor respectively. These accessors are
	   read-write, so you can use them to change the class name.

       $metaclass->error_class($class_name)
	   The name of the class used to throw errors. This defaults to
	   Moose::Error::Default, which generates an error with a stacktrace
	   just like "Carp::confess".

       $metaclass->throw_error($message, %extra)
	   Throws the error created by "create_error" using "raise_error"
