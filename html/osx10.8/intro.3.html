NAME
     intro -- introduction to the C libraries

DESCRIPTION
     This section provides an overview of the C library functions, their error
     returns and other common definitions and concepts.  Most of these func-
     tions are available from the System library, libSystem.  Other libraries
     must be indicated at compile time with the -l option of the compiler.

     The various libraries (followed by the loader flag):

     libSystem (-lSystem)  Standard C library functions.  When using the C
			   compiler cc(1), it is not necessary to supply the
			   loader flag -lSystem for these functions.  There
			   are several `libraries' or groups of functions
			   included inside of libSystem: the standard I/O rou-
			   tines, database routines, bit operators, string
			   operators, character tests and character operators,
			   des encryption routines, storage allocation, time
			   functions, signal handling and more.

			   For compatibility with other systems, which provide
			   these capabilities in separate libraries (such as
			   libc), symbolic links are provided for -lc, -ldbm,
			   -ldl, -linfo, -lm, -lpoll, -lpthread and -lrpcsvc;
			   they all point to libSystem.

     libcurses (-lcurses -ltermcap)
			   Terminal independent screen management routines for
			   two dimensional non-bitmap display terminals.  (See
			   ncurses(3).)

     libl (-ll) 	   The library for lex(1).

     libtermcap (-ltermcap)
			   The terminal independent operation library package.
			   (See termcap(3).)

     liby (-ly) 	   The library for yacc(1).

FILES
     /usr/lib/libSystem.dylib	       the main System library
     /usr/lib/libSystem_debug.dylib    the main System library compiled with
				       debug support
     /usr/lib/libSystem_profile.dylib  the main System library compiled for
				       profiling
