NAME
       PAR::Packer - PAR Packager

DESCRIPTION
       This module implements the App::Packer::Backend interface, for
       generating stand-alone executables, perl scripts and PAR files.

       Currently, this module is used by the command line tool pp internally,
       as well as by the contributed contrib/gui_pp/gpp program.

       Since version 0.97 of PAR, this module and its related tools such as
       "pp" have been stripped from the PAR distribution and are now
       distributed as the "PAR-Packer" distribution so that PAR users need not
       necessarily have a C compiler.

SEE ALSO
       PAR, pp

       App::Packer, App::Packer::Backend

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
       Mattia Barbon for taking the first step in refactoring pp into
       App::Packer::Backend::PAR, and Edward S. Peschko for continuing the
       work that eventually became this module.
