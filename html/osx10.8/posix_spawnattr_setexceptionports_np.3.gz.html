NAME
     posix_spawnattr_setspecialport_np posix_spawnattr_setexceptionports_np --
     set special ports on a posix_spawnattr_t

SYNOPSIS
     #include <spawn.h>

     int
     posix_spawnattr_setspecialport_np(posix_spawnattr_t *attr,
	 mach_port_t new_port, int which);

     int
     posix_spawnattr_setexceptionports_np(posix_spawnattr_t *attr,
	 exception_mask_t mask, mach_port_t new_port,
	 exception_behavior_t behavior, thread_state_flavor_t flavor);

IMPORTANT
     These functions represent an Apple extension to posix_spawn(2) and
     posix_spawnp(2), and as such should not be used by programs intending
     their code to be portable to other platforms.

DESCRIPTION
     The posix_spawnattr_setspecialport_np() function sets a new value for a
     Mach special port into the value referenced by attr to the port refer-
     enced by new_port for a port value of which, as if the new process had
     called task_set_special_port().

     The posix_spawnattr_setexceptionports_np() function sets the Mach port to
     new_port for a number of exception ports represented by the bitfield
     mask, and sets the new default behavior and default flavor, as if the new
     process had called task_set_exception_ports().

RETURN VALUES
     On success, these functions return 0; on failure they return an error
     number from <errno.h>.

ERRORS
     These functions may fail if:

     [EINVAL]		The value specified by attr is invalid.

     [EINVAL]		The value of attr is invalid.

     [ENOMEM]		Insufficient resources exist to set the ports.
