NAME
       suexec - Switch user before executing external programs


SYNOPSIS
       suexec -V



SUMMARY
       suexec  is  used  by  the  Apache HTTP Server to switch to another user
       before executing CGI programs. In order to achieve this, it must run as
       root.  Since  the  HTTP daemon normally doesn't run as root, the suexec
       executable needs the setuid bit set and	must  be  owned  by  root.  It
       should never be writable for any other person than root.


       For  further  information about the concepts and and the security model
       of    suexec    please	 refer	  to	the    suexec	 documentation
       (http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/suexec.html).



OPTIONS
       -V     If  you  are  root,  this option displays the compile options of
	      suexec. For  security  reasons  all  configuration  options  are
	      changeable only at compile time.
