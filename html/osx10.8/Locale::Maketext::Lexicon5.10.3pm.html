Locale::Maketext::LexiUser3Contributed Perl DocumeLocale::Maketext::Lexicon(3)



NAME
       Locale::Maketext::Lexicon - Use other catalog formats in Maketext

VERSION
       This document describes version 0.79 of Locale::Maketext::Lexicon,
       released December 29, 2008.

SYNOPSIS
       As part of a localization class, automatically glob for available
       lexicons:

	   package Hello::I18N;
	   use base 'Locale::Maketext';
	   use Locale::Maketext::Lexicon {
	       '*' =&gt [Gettext =&gt '/usr/local/share/locale/*/LC_MESSAGES/hello.mo'],
	       ### Uncomment to decode lexicon entries into Unicode strings
	       # _decode =&gt 1,
	       ### Uncomment to fallback when a key is missing from lexicons
	       # _auto	 =&gt 1,
	       ### Uncomment to use %1 / %quant(%1) instead of [_1] / [quant, _1]
	       # _style  =&gt 'gettext',
	   };

       Explicitly specify languages, during compile- or run-time:

	   package Hello::I18N;
	   use base 'Locale::Maketext';
	   use Locale::Maketext::Lexicon {
	       de =&gt [Gettext =&gt 'hello_de.po'],
	       fr =&gt [
		   Gettext =&gt 'hello_fr.po',
		   Gettext =&gt 'local/hello/fr.po',
	       ],
	   };
	   # ... incrementally add new lexicons
	   Locale::Maketext::Lexicon-&gtimport({
	       de =&gt [Gettext =&gt 'local/hello/de.po'],
	   })

       Alternatively, as part of a localization subclass:

	   package Hello::I18N::de;
	   use base 'Hello::I18N';
	   use Locale::Maketext::Lexicon (Gettext =&gt \*DATA);
	   __DATA__
	   # Some sample data
	   msgid ""
	   msgstr ""
	   "Project-Id-Version: Hello 1.3.22.1\n"
	   "MIME-Version: 1.0\n"
	   "Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso8859-1\n"
	   "Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit\n"

	   #: Hello.pm:10
	   msgid "Hello, World!"
	   msgstr "Hallo, Welt!"

	   #: Hello.pm:11
	   msgid "You have %quant(%1,piece) of mail."
	   msgstr "Sie haben %quant(%1,Poststueck,Poststuecken)."

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides lexicon-handling modules to read from other
       localization formats, such as Gettext, Msgcat, and so on.

       If you are unfamiliar with the concept of lexicon modules, please
       consult Locale::Maketext and the "webl10n" HTML files in the "docs/"
       directory of this module.

       A command-line utility xgettext.pl is also installed with this module,
       for extracting translatable strings from source files.

   The "import" function
       The "import()" function accepts two forms of arguments:

       (format =&gt source ... )
	   This form takes any number of argument pairs (usually one); source
	   may be a file name, a filehandle, or an array reference.

	   For each such pair, it pass the contents specified by the second
	   argument to Locale::Maketext::Lexicon::format-&gtparse as a plain
	   list, and export its return value as the %Lexicon hash in the
	   calling package.

	   In the case that there are multiple such pairs, the lexicon defined
	   by latter ones overrides earlier ones.

       { language =&gt [ format, source ... ] ... }
	   This form accepts a hash reference.	It will export a %Lexicon into
	   the subclasses specified by each language, using the process
	   described above.  It is designed to alleviate the need to set up a
	   separate subclass for each localized language, and just use the
	   catalog files.

	   This module will convert the language arguments into lowercase, and
	   replace all "-" with "_", so "zh_TW" and "zh-tw" will both map to
	   the "zh_tw" subclass.

	   If language begins with "_", it is taken as an option that controls
	   how lexicons are parsed.  See "Options" for a list of available
	   options.

	   The "*" is a special language; it must be used in conjunction with
	   a filename that also contains "*"; all matched files with a valid
	   language code in the place of "*" will be automatically prepared as
	   a lexicon subclass.	If there is multiple "*" in the filename, the
	   last one is used as the language name.

   Options
       "_auto"
	   If set to a true value, missing lookups on lexicons are handled
	   silently, as if an "Auto" lexicon has been appended on all language
	   lexicons.

       "_decode"
	   If set to a true value, source entries will be converted into
	   utf8-strings (available in Perl 5.6.1 or later).  This feature
	   needs the Encode or Encode::compat module.

	   Currently, only the "Gettext" backend supports this option.

       "_encoding"
	   This option only has effect when "_decode" is set to true.  It
	   specifies an encoding to store lexicon entries, instead of
	   utf8-strings.

	   If "_encoding" is set to "locale", the encoding from the current
	   locale setting is used.

   Subclassing format handlers
       If you wish to override how sources specified in different data types
       are handled, please use a subclass that overrides "lexicon_get_TYPE".

       XXX: not documented well enough yet.  Patches welcome.

NOTES
       When you attempt to localize an entry missing in the lexicon, Maketext
       will throw an exception by default.  To inhibit this behaviour,
       override the "_AUTO" key in your language subclasses, for example:

	   $Hello::I18N::en::Lexicon{_AUTO} = 1; # autocreate missing keys

       If you want to implement a new "Lexicon::*" backend module, please note
       that "parse()" takes an array containing the source strings from the
       specified filehandle or filename, which are not "chomp"ed.  Although if
       the source is an array reference, its elements will probably not
       contain any newline characters anyway.

       The "parse()" function should return a hash reference, which will be
       assigned to the typeglob (*Lexicon) of the language module.  All it
       amounts to is that if the returned reference points to a tied hash, the
       %Lexicon will be aliased to the same tied hash if it was not
       initialized previously.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
       Thanks to Jesse Vincent for suggesting this module to be written.

       Thanks also to Sean M. Burke for coming up with Locale::Maketext in the
       first place, and encouraging me to experiment with alternative Lexicon
       syntaxes.

       Thanks also to Yi Ma Mao for providing the MO file parsing subroutine,
       as well as inspiring me to implement file globbing and transcoding
       support.

       See the AUTHORS file in the distribution for a list of people who have
       sent helpful patches, ideas or comments.
