     dirhelper -- helper for special directory creation

SYNOPSIS
     dirhelper

DESCRIPTION
     The dirhelper command is a launch-on-demand helper for special directory
     creation.	It is launched in a privileged context via launchd in order to
     create special directories where the user would not otherwise have per-
     mission to do so.

     The dirhelper command should not be invoked directly.  It will exit auto-
     matically after a period of inactivity.
