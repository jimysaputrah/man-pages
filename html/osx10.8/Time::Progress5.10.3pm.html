NAME
       Time::Progress - Elapsed and estimated finish time reporting.

SYNOPSIS
	 use Time::Progress;
	 # autoflush to get \r working
	 $| = 1;
	 # get new `timer'
	 my $p = new Time::Progress;

	 # restart and report progress
	 $p-&gtrestart;
	 sleep 5; # or do some work here
	 print $p-&gtreport( "done %p elapsed: %L (%l sec), ETA %E (%e sec)\n", 50 );

	 # set min and max values
	 $p-&gtattr( min =&gt 2, max =&gt 20 );
	 # restart `timer'
	 $p-&gtrestart;
	 my $c;
	 for( $c = 2; $c &lt= 20; $c++ )
	   {
	   # print progress bar and percentage done
	   print $p-&gtreport( "eta: %E min, %40b %p\r", $c );
	   sleep 1; # work...
	   }
	 # stop timer
	 $p-&gtstop;

	 # report times
	 print $p-&gtelapsed_str;

DESCRIPTION
       Shortest time interval that can be measured is 1 second. The available
       methods are:

       new
	     my $p = new Time::Progress;

	   Returns new object of Time::Progress class and starts the timer. It
	   also sets min and max values to 0 and 100, so the next report calls
	   will default to percents range.

       restart
	   restarts the timer and clears the stop mark. optionally restart()
	   may act also as attr() for setting attributes:

	     $p-&gtrestart( min =&gt 1, max =&gt 5 );

	   is the same as:

	     $p-&gtattr( min =&gt 1, max =&gt 5 );
	     $p-&gtrestart();

	   If you need to count things, you can set just 'max' attribute since
	   'min' is already set to 0 when object is constructed by new():

	     $p-&gtrestart( max =&gt 42 );

       stop
	   Sets the stop mark. this is only usefull if you do some work, then
	   finish, then do some work that shouldn't be timed and finally
	   report. Something like:

	     $p-&gtrestart;
	     # do some work here...
	     $p-&gtstop;
	     # do some post-work here
	     print $p-&gtreport;
	     # `post-work' will not be timed

	   Stop is useless if you want to report time as soon as work is
	   finished like:

	     $p-&gtrestart;
	     # do some work here...
	     print $p-&gtreport;

       continue
	   Clears the stop mark. (mostly useless, perhaps you need to
	   restart?)

       attr
	   Sets and returns internal values for attributes. Available
	   attributes are:

	   min This is the min value of the items that will follow (used to
	       calculate estimated finish time)

	   max This is the max value of all items in the even (also used to
	       calculate estimated finish time)

	   format
	       This is the default report format. It is used if report is
	       called without parameters.

	   attr returns array of the set attributes:

	     my ( $new_min, $new_max ) = $p-&gtattr( min =&gt 1, max =&gt 5 );

	   If you want just to get values use undef:

	     my $old_format = $p-&gtattr( format =&gt undef );

	   This way of handling attributes is a bit heavy but saves a lot of
	   attribute handling functions. attr will complain if you pass odd
	   number of parameters.

       report
	   report is the most complex method in this package! :)

	   expected arguments are:

	     $p-&gtreport( format, [current_item] );

	   format is string that will be used for the result string.
	   Recognized special sequences are:

	   %l  elapsed seconds

	   %L  elapsed time in minutes in format MM:SS

	   %e  remaining seconds

	   %E  remaining time in minutes in format MM:SS

	   %p  percentage done in format PPP.P%

	   %f  estimated finish time in format returned by localtime()

	   %b
	   %B  progress bar which looks like:

		 ##############......................

	       %b takes optional width:

		 %40b -- 40-chars wide bar
		 %9b  --  9-chars wide bar
		 %b   -- 79-chars wide bar (default)

	   Parameters can be ommited and then default format set with attr
	   will be used.

	   Sequences 'L', 'l', 'E' and 'e' can have width also:

	     %10e
	     %5l
	     ...

	   Estimate time calculations can be used only if min and max values
	   are set (see attr method) and current item is passed to report! if
	   you want to use the default format but still have estimates use it
	   like this:

	     $p-&gtformat( undef, 45 );

	   If you don't give current item (step) or didn't set proper min/max
	   value then all estimate sequences will have value `n/a'.

	   You can freely mix reports during the same event.

       elapsed
       estimated
       elapsed_str
       estimated_str
	   helpers -- return elapsed/estimated seconds or string in format:

	     "elapsed time is MM:SS min.\n"
	     "remaining time is MM:SS min.\n"

FORMAT EXAMPLES
	 # $c is current element (step) reached
	 # for the examples: min = 0, max = 100, $c = 33.3

	 print $p-&gtreport( "done %p elapsed: %L (%l sec), ETA %E (%e sec)\n", $c );
	 # prints:
	 # done  33.3% elapsed time   0:05 (5 sec), ETA   0:07 (7 sec)

	 print $p-&gtreport( "%45b %p\r", $c );
	 # prints:
	 # ###############..............................  33.3%

	 print $p-&gtreport( "done %p ETA %f\n", $c );
	 # prints:
	 # done  33.3% ETA Sun Oct 21 16:50:57 2001
