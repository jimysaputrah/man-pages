NAME
       ModPerl::Registry - Run unaltered CGI scripts persistently under
       mod_perl

Synopsis
	 # httpd.conf
	 PerlModule ModPerl::Registry
	 Alias /perl/ /home/httpd/perl/
	 <Location /perl>
	     SetHandler perl-script
	     PerlResponseHandler ModPerl::Registry
	     #PerlOptions +ParseHeaders
	     #PerlOptions -GlobalRequest
	     Options +ExecCGI
	 </Location>

Description
       URIs in the form of "http://example.com/perl/test.pl" will be compiled
       as the body of a Perl subroutine and executed.  Each child process will
       compile the subroutine once and store it in memory. It will recompile
       it whenever the file (e.g. test.pl in our example) is updated on disk.
       Think of it as an object oriented server with each script implementing
       a class loaded at runtime.

       The file looks much like a "normal" script, but it is compiled into a
       subroutine.

       For example:

	 my $r = Apache2::RequestUtil->request;
	 $r->content_type("text/html");
	 $r->send_http_header;
	 $r->print("mod_perl rules!");

       XXX: STOPPED here. Below is the old Apache::Registry document which I
       haven't worked through yet.

       META: document that for now we don't chdir() into the script's dir,
       because it affects the whole process under threads.
       "ModPerl::RegistryPrefork" should be used by those who run only under
       prefork MPM.

       This module emulates the CGI environment, allowing programmers to write
       scripts that run under CGI or mod_perl without change.  Existing CGI
       scripts may require some changes, simply because a CGI script has a
       very short lifetime of one HTTP request, allowing you to get away with
       "quick and dirty" scripting.  Using mod_perl and ModPerl::Registry
       requires you to be more careful, but it also gives new meaning to the
       word "quick"!

       Be sure to read all mod_perl related documentation for more details,
       including instructions for setting up an environment that looks exactly
       like CGI:

	print "Content-type: text/html\n\n";
	print "Hi There!";

       Note that each httpd process or "child" must compile each script once,
       so the first request to one server may seem slow, but each request
       there after will be faster.  If your scripts are large and/or make use
       of many Perl modules, this difference should be noticeable to the human
       eye.

DirectoryIndex
       If you are trying setup a DirectoryIndex under a Location covered by
       ModPerl::Registry* you might run into some trouble.

       META: if this gets added to core, replace with real documenation.  See
       http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=apache-modperl&m=112805393100758&w=2

Special Blocks
   "BEGIN" Blocks
       "BEGIN" blocks defined in scripts running under the "ModPerl::Registry"
       handler behave similarly to the normal mod_perl handlers plus:

       o   Only once, if pulled in by the parent process via
	   "Apache2::RegistryLoader".

       o   An additional time, once per child process or Perl interpreter,
	   each time the script file changes on disk.

       "BEGIN" blocks defined in modules loaded from "ModPerl::Registry"
       scripts behave identically to the normal mod_perl handlers, regardless
       of whether they define a package or not.

   "CHECK" and "INIT" Blocks
       Same as normal mod_perl handlers.

   "END" Blocks
       "END" blocks encountered during compilation of a script, are called
       after the script has completed its run, including subsequent
       invocations when the script is cached in memory. This is assuming that
       the script itself doesn't define a package on its own. If the script
       defines its own package, the "END" blocks in the scope of that package
       will be executed at the end of the interpretor's life.

       "END" blocks residing in modules loaded by registry script will be
       executed only once, when the interpreter exits.

Security
       "ModPerl::Registry::handler" performs the same sanity checks as mod_cgi
       does, before running the script.

Environment
       The Apache function `exit' overrides the Perl core built-in function.

Commandline Switches In First Line
       Normally when a Perl script is run from the command line or under CGI,
       arguments on the `#!' line are passed to the perl interpreter for
       processing.

       "ModPerl::Registry" currently only honors the -w switch and will enable
       the "warnings" pragma in such case.

       Another common switch used with CGI scripts is -T to turn on taint
       checking.  This can only be enabled when the server starts with the
       configuration directive:

	PerlSwitches -T

       However, if taint checking is not enabled, but the -T switch is seen,
       "ModPerl::Registry" will write a warning to the error_log file.

Debugging
       You may set the debug level with the $ModPerl::Registry::Debug bitmask

	1 => log recompile in errorlog
	2 => ModPerl::Debug::dump in case of $@
	4 => trace pedantically

Caveats
       ModPerl::Registry makes things look just the CGI environment, however,
       you must understand that this *is not CGI*.  Each httpd child will
       compile your script into memory and keep it there, whereas CGI will run
       it once, cleaning out the entire process space.	Many times you have
       heard "always use "-w", always use "-w" and 'use strict'".  This is
       more important here than anywhere else!	Some other important caveats
       to keep in mind are discussed on the Perl Reference page.
