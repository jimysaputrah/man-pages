File::stat(3pm)        Perl Programmers Reference Guide        File::stat(3pm)



NAME
       File::stat - by-name interface to Perl's built-in stat() functions

SYNOPSIS
	use File::stat;
	$st = stat($file) or die "No $file: $!";
	if ( ($st-&gtmode & 0111) && $st-&gtnlink &gt 1) ) {
	    print "$file is executable with lotsa links\n";
	}

	if ( -x $st ) {
	    print "$file is executable\n";
	}

	use Fcntl "S_IRUSR";
	if ( $st-&gtcando(S_IRUSR, 1) ) {
	    print "My effective uid can read $file\n";
	}

	use File::stat qw(:FIELDS);
	stat($file) or die "No $file: $!";
	if ( ($st_mode & 0111) && ($st_nlink &gt 1) ) {
	    print "$file is executable with lotsa links\n";
	}

DESCRIPTION
       This module's default exports override the core stat() and lstat()
       functions, replacing them with versions that return "File::stat"
       objects.  This object has methods that return the similarly named
       structure field name from the stat(2) function; namely, dev, ino, mode,
       nlink, uid, gid, rdev, size, atime, mtime, ctime, blksize, and blocks.

       As of version 1.02 (provided with perl 5.12) the object provides "-X"
       overloading, so you can call filetest operators ("-f", "-x", and so on)
       on it. It also provides a "-&gtcando" method, called like

	$st-&gtcando( ACCESS, EFFECTIVE )

       where ACCESS is one of "S_IRUSR", "S_IWUSR" or "S_IXUSR" from the Fcntl
       module, and EFFECTIVE indicates whether to use effective (true) or real
       (false) ids. The method interprets the "mode", "uid" and "gid" fields,
       and returns whether or not the current process would be allowed the
       specified access.

       If you don't want to use the objects, you may import the "-&gtcando"
       method into your namespace as a regular function called "stat_cando".
       This takes an arrayref containing the return values of "stat" or
       "lstat" as its first argument, and interprets it for you.

       You may also import all the structure fields directly into your
       namespace as regular variables using the :FIELDS import tag.  (Note
       that this still overrides your stat() and lstat() functions.)  Access
       these fields as variables named with a preceding "st_" in front their
       method names.  Thus, "$stat_obj-&gtdev()" corresponds to $st_dev if you
       import the fields.

       To access this functionality without the core overrides, pass the "use"
       an empty import list, and then access function functions with their
       full qualified names.  On the other hand, the built-ins are still
       available via the "CORE::" pseudo-package.

BUGS
       As of Perl 5.8.0 after using this module you cannot use the implicit $_
       or the special filehandle "_" with stat() or lstat(), trying to do so
       leads into strange errors.  The workaround is for $_ to be explicit

	   my $stat_obj = stat $_;

       and for "_" to explicitly populate the object using the unexported and
       undocumented populate() function with CORE::stat():

	   my $stat_obj = File::stat::populate(CORE::stat(_));

ERRORS
       -%s is not implemented on a File::stat object
	   The filetest operators "-t", "-T" and "-B" are not implemented, as
	   they require more information than just a stat buffer.

WARNINGS
       These can all be disabled with

	   no warnings "File::stat";

       File::stat ignores use filetest 'access'
	   You have tried to use one of the "-rwxRWX" filetests with "use
	   filetest 'access'" in effect. "File::stat" will ignore the pragma,
	   and just use the information in the "mode" member as usual.

       File::stat ignores VMS ACLs
	   VMS systems have a permissions structure that cannot be completely
	   represented in a stat buffer, and unlike on other systems the
	   builtin filetest operators respect this. The "File::stat"
	   overloads, however, do not, since the information required is not
	   available.

NOTE
       While this class is currently implemented using the Class::Struct
       module to build a struct-like class, you shouldn't rely upon this.
