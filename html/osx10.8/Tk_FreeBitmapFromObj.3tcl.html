ARGUMENTS
       Tcl_Interp *interp (in)		     Interpreter   to  use  for  error

					     defined.

       const char *source (in)		     Data for bitmap, in standard bit-
					     map format.  Must	be  stored  in

       Pixmap bitmap (in)		     Identifier for a bitmap allocated
					     by    Tk_AllocBitmapFromObj    or
					     Tk_GetBitmap.

DESCRIPTION
       These  procedures  manage  a  collection of bitmaps (one-plane pixmaps)
       being used by an application.  The procedures allow bitmaps to  be  re-
       used efficiently, thereby avoiding server overhead, and also allow bit-
       maps to be named with character strings.

       Tk_AllocBitmapFromObj returns a Pixmap identifier  for  a  bitmap  that
       matches the description in objPtr and is suitable for use in tkwin.  It
       re-uses an existing bitmap, if possible, and creates a new  one	other-
       wise.  ObjPtr's value must have one of the following forms:

       @fileName	   FileName  must  be  the name of a file containing a
			   bitmap description in the standard X11 or X10  for-
			   mat.

       name		   Name  must  be  the name of a bitmap defined previ-
			   ously with a call to Tk_DefineBitmap.  The  follow-
			   ing names are pre-defined by Tk:

			   error       The  international  "don't"  symbol:  a
				       circle with a diagonal line across  it.

			   gray75      75%  gray: a checkerboard pattern where
				       three out of four bits are on.

			   gray50      50% gray: a checkerboard pattern  where
				       every other bit is on.

			   gray25      25%  gray: a checkerboard pattern where
				       one out of every four bits is on.

			   gray12      12.5% gray: a pattern where  one-eighth
				       of the bits are on, consisting of every
				       fourth pixel in every other row.

			   hourglass   An hourglass symbol.

			   info        A large letter "i".

			   questhead   The silhouette of a human head, with  a
				       question mark in it.

			   question    A large question-mark.

			   warning     A large exclamation point.

			   In  addition,  the  following pre-defined names are
			   available only on the Macintosh platform:

			   document    A generic document.

			   stationery  Document stationery.

			   edition     The edition symbol.

			   application Generic application icon.

			   accessory   A desk accessory.

			   folder      Generic folder icon.

			   pfolder     A locked folder.

			   trash       A trash can.

			   floppy      A floppy disk.

			   ramdisk     A floppy disk with chip.

			   cdrom       A cd disk icon.

			   preferences A folder with prefs symbol.

			   querydoc    A database document icon.

			   stop        A stop sign.

			   note        A face with balloon words.

			   caution     A triangle with an exclamation point.

       Under normal conditions, Tk_AllocBitmapFromObj  returns	an  identifier
       for  the  requested bitmap.  If an error occurs in creating the bitmap,
       such as when objPtr  refers  to	a  non-existent  file,	then  None  is
       returned  and  an error message is left in interp's result if interp is
       not NULL. Tk_AllocBitmapFromObj caches  information  about  the	return
       value  in  objPtr,  which  speeds up future calls to procedures such as
       Tk_AllocBitmapFromObj and Tk_GetBitmapFromObj.

       Tk_GetBitmap is identical  to  Tk_AllocBitmapFromObj  except  that  the
       description  of	the  bitmap  is  specified with a string instead of an
       object.	This prevents Tk_GetBitmap from caching the return  value,  so
       Tk_GetBitmap is less efficient than Tk_AllocBitmapFromObj.

       Tk_GetBitmapFromObj returns the token for an existing bitmap, given the
       window and description used to create the bitmap.   Tk_GetBitmapFromObj
       does  not actually create the bitmap; the bitmap must already have been
       created with a previous call to Tk_AllocBitmapFromObj or  Tk_GetBitmap.
       The  return  value is cached in objPtr, which speeds up future calls to
       Tk_GetBitmapFromObj with the same objPtr and tkwin.

       Tk_DefineBitmap associates a name with in-memory bitmap	data  so  that
       the name can be used in later calls to Tk_AllocBitmapFromObj or Tk_Get-
       Bitmap.	The nameId argument gives a name for the bitmap;  it must  not
       previously  have been used in a call to Tk_DefineBitmap.  The arguments
       source, width, and height describe the  bitmap.	 Tk_DefineBitmap  nor-
       mally  returns  TCL_OK;	if an error occurs (e.g. a bitmap named nameId
       has already been defined) then TCL_ERROR is returned and an error  mes-
       sage  is  left  in  interp-&gtresult.  Note:  Tk_DefineBitmap expects the
       memory pointed to by source to be  static:   Tk_DefineBitmap  does  not
       make  a	private  copy of this memory, but uses the bytes pointed to by
       source later in calls to Tk_AllocBitmapFromObj or Tk_GetBitmap.

       Typically  Tk_DefineBitmap  is  used  by  #include-ing  a  bitmap  file
       directly into a C program and then referencing the variables defined by
       the file.  For example, suppose there exists a file stip.bitmap,  which
       was  created by the bitmap program and contains a stipple pattern.  The
       following code uses Tk_DefineBitmap to define a new bitmap named foo:
	      Pixmap bitmap;
	      #include "stip.bitmap"
	      Tk_DefineBitmap(interp, "foo", stip_bits,
		  stip_width, stip_height);
	      ...
	      bitmap = Tk_GetBitmap(interp, tkwin, "foo");
       This code causes the bitmap file to be read at compile-time and	incor-
       porates	the  bitmap  information  into the program's executable image.
       The same bitmap file could be read at run-time using Tk_GetBitmap:
	      Pixmap bitmap;
	      bitmap = Tk_GetBitmap(interp, tkwin, "@stip.bitmap");
       The second form is a bit more flexible  (the  file  could  be  modified
       after  the  program  has  been compiled, or a different string could be
       provided to read a different file), but	it  is	a  little  slower  and
       requires the bitmap file to exist separately from the program.

       Tk  maintains  a database of all the bitmaps that are currently in use.
       Whenever possible, it will return an existing bitmap rather than creat-
       ing  a  new  one.   When a bitmap is no longer used, Tk will release it
       automatically.  This approach can substantially reduce server overhead,
       so  Tk_AllocBitmapFromObj  and Tk_GetBitmap should generally be used in
       preference to Xlib procedures like XReadBitmapFile.

       The bitmaps returned  by  Tk_AllocBitmapFromObj	and  Tk_GetBitmap  are
       shared, so callers should never modify them.  If a bitmap must be modi-
       fied dynamically, then it should be created by calling Xlib  procedures
       such as XReadBitmapFile or XCreatePixmap directly.

       The  procedure  Tk_NameOfBitmap is roughly the inverse of Tk_GetBitmap.
       Given an X Pixmap argument, it returns the textual description that was
       passed  to  Tk_GetBitmap when the bitmap was created.  Bitmap must have
       been the return value from a previous call to Tk_AllocBitmapFromObj  or
       Tk_GetBitmap.

       Tk_SizeOfBitmap	returns  the  dimensions of its bitmap argument in the
       words pointed to by the widthPtr  and  heightPtr  arguments.   As  with
       Tk_NameOfBitmap, bitmap must have been created by Tk_AllocBitmapFromObj
       or Tk_GetBitmap.

       When  a	bitmap	is   no   longer   needed,   Tk_FreeBitmapFromObj   or
       Tk_FreeBitmap should be called to release it.  For Tk_FreeBitmapFromObj
       the bitmap to release is specified with the same  information  used  to
       create  it;  for  Tk_FreeBitmap the bitmap to release is specified with
       its  Pixmap   token.    There   should	be   exactly   one   call   to
       Tk_FreeBitmapFromObj    or    Tk_FreeBitmap    for    each    call   to
       Tk_AllocBitmapFromObj or Tk_GetBitmap.


BUGS
       In determining whether an existing bitmap can be used to satisfy a  new
       request, Tk_AllocBitmapFromObj and Tk_GetBitmap consider only the imme-
       diate value of the string description.  For example, when a  file  name
       is  passed  to Tk_GetBitmap, Tk_GetBitmap will assume it is safe to re-
       use an existing bitmap created from the same file name:	 it  will  not
       check  to  see whether the file itself has changed, or whether the cur-
       rent directory has changed, thereby causing the name to refer to a dif-
       ferent file.
