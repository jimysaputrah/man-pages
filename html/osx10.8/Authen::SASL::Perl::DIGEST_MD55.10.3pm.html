NAME
       Authen::SASL::Perl::DIGEST_MD5 - Digest MD5 Authentication class

SYNOPSIS
	 use Authen::SASL qw(Perl);

	 $sasl = Authen::SASL-&gtnew(
	   mechanism =&gt 'DIGEST-MD5',
	   callback  =&gt {
	     user =&gt $user,
	     pass =&gt $pass,
	     serv =&gt $serv
	   },
	 );

DESCRIPTION
       This method implements the client and server parts of the DIGEST-MD5
       SASL algorithm, as described in RFC 2831.

   CALLBACK
       The callbacks used are:

       client

       authname
	   The authorization id to use after successful authentication

       user
	   The username to be used in the response

       pass
	   The password to be used to compute the response.

       serv
	   The service name when authenticating to a replicated service

       realm
	   The authentication realm when overriding the server-provided
	   default.  If not given the server-provided value is used.

	   The callback will be passed the list of realms that the server
	   provided in the initial response.

       server

       realm
	   The default realm to provide to the client

       getsecret(username, realm, authzid)
	   returns the password associated with "username" and "realm"

   PROPERTIES
       The properties used are:

       maxbuf
	   The maximum buffer size for receiving cipher text

       minssf
	   The minimum SSF value that should be provided by the SASL security
	   layer.  The default is 0

       maxssf
	   The maximum SSF value that should be provided by the SASL security
	   layer.  The default is 2**31

       externalssf
	   The SSF value provided by an underlying external security layer.
	   The default is 0

       ssf The actual SSF value provided by the SASL security layer after the
	   SASL authentication phase has been completed. This value is read-
	   only and set by the implementation after the SASL authentication
	   phase has been completed.

       maxout
	   The maximum plaintext buffer size for sending data to the peer.
	   This value is set by the implementation after the SASL
	   authentication phase has been completed and a SASL security layer
	   is in effect.
