NAME
       DBIx::Class::Storage::Statistics - SQL Statistics

SYNOPSIS
DESCRIPTION
       This class is called by DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI as a means of
       collecting statistics on its actions.  Using this class alone merely
       prints the SQL executed, the fact that it completes and begin/end
       notification for transactions.

       To really use this class you should subclass it and create your own
       method for collecting the statistics as discussed in
       DBIx::Class::Manual::Cookbook.

METHODS
   new
       Returns a new DBIx::Class::Storage::Statistics object.

   debugfh
       Sets or retrieves the filehandle used for trace/debug output.  This
       should be an IO::Handle compatible object (only the "print" method is
       used). Initially should be set to STDERR - although see information on
       the DBIC_TRACE environment variable.

       As getter it will lazily open a filehandle for you if one is not
       already set.

   print
       Prints the specified string to our debugging filehandle.  Provided to
       save our methods the worry of how to display the message.

   silence
       Turn off all output if set to true.

   txn_begin
       Called when a transaction begins.

   txn_rollback
       Called when a transaction is rolled back.

   txn_commit
       Called when a transaction is committed.

   svp_begin
       Called when a savepoint is created.

   svp_release
       Called when a savepoint is released.

   svp_rollback
       Called when rolling back to a savepoint.

   query_start
       Called before a query is executed.  The first argument is the SQL
       string being executed and subsequent arguments are the parameters used
       for the query.

   query_end
       Called when a query finishes executing.	Has the same arguments as
       query_start.
