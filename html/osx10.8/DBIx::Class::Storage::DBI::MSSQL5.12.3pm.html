NAME
       DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::MSSQL - Base Class for Microsoft SQL Server
       support in DBIx::Class

SYNOPSIS
       This is the base class for Microsoft SQL Server support, used by
       DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::ODBC::Microsoft_SQL_Server and
       DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::Sybase::Microsoft_SQL_Server.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
   IDENTITY information
       Microsoft SQL Server supports three methods of retrieving the IDENTITY
       value for inserted row: IDENT_CURRENT, @@IDENTITY, and
       SCOPE_IDENTITY().  SCOPE_IDENTITY is used here because it is the
       safest.	However, it must be called is the same execute statement, not
       just the same connection.

       So, this implementation appends a SELECT SCOPE_IDENTITY() statement
       onto each INSERT to accommodate that requirement.

       "SELECT @@IDENTITY" can also be used by issuing:

	 $self->_identity_method('@@identity');

       it will only be used if SCOPE_IDENTITY() fails.

       This is more dangerous, as inserting into a table with an on insert
       trigger that inserts into another table with an identity will give
       erroneous results on recent versions of SQL Server.

   identity insert
       Be aware that we have tried to make things as simple as possible for
       our users.  For MSSQL that means that when a user tries to create a
       row, while supplying an explicit value for an autoincrementing column,
       we will try to issue the appropriate database call to make this
       possible, namely "SET IDENTITY_INSERT $table_name ON". Unfortunately
       this operation in MSSQL requires the "db_ddladmin" privilege, which is
       normally not included in the standard write-permissions.

   Ordered Subselects
       If you attempted the following query (among many others) in Microsoft
       SQL Server

	$rs->search ({}, {
	 prefetch => 'relation',
	 rows => 2,
	 offset => 3,
	});

       You may be surprised to receive an exception. The reason for this is a
       quirk in the MSSQL engine itself, and sadly doesn't have a sensible
       workaround due to the way DBIC is built. DBIC can do truly wonderful
       things with the aid of subselects, and does so automatically when
       necessary. The list of situations when a subselect is necessary is long
       and still changes often, so it can not be exhaustively enumerated here.
       The general rule of thumb is a joined has_many relationship with
       limit/group applied to the left part of the join.

       In its "pursuit of standards" Microsft SQL Server goes to great lengths
       to forbid the use of ordered subselects. This breaks a very useful
       group of searches like "Give me things number 4 to 6 (ordered by name),
       and prefetch all their relations, no matter how many". While there is a
       hack which fools the syntax checker, the optimizer may still elect to
       break the subselect.  Testing has determined that while such breakage
       does occur (the test suite contains an explicit test which demonstrates
       the problem), it is relative rare. The benefits of ordered subselects
       are on the other hand too great to be outright disabled for MSSQL.

       Thus compromise between usability and perfection is the MSSQL-specific
       resultset attribute "unsafe_subselect_ok".  It is deliberately not
       possible to set this on the Storage level, as the user should inspect
       (and preferably regression-test) the return of every such ResultSet
       individually. The example above would work if written like:

	$rs->search ({}, {
	 unsafe_subselect_ok => 1,
	 prefetch => 'relation',
	 rows => 2,
	 offset => 3,
	});

       If it is possible to rewrite the search() in a way that will avoid the
       need for this flag - you are urged to do so. If DBIC internals insist
       that an ordered subselect is necessary for an operation, and you
       believe there is a different/better way to get the same result - please
       file a bugreport.
