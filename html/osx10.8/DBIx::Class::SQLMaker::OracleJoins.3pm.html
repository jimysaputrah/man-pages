NAME
       DBIx::Class::SQLMaker::OracleJoins - Pre-ANSI Joins-via-Where-Clause
       Syntax

PURPOSE
       This module is used with Oracle &lt 9.0 due to lack of support for
       standard ANSI join syntax.

SYNOPSIS
       Not intended for use directly; used as the sql_maker_class for schemas
       and components.

DESCRIPTION
       Implements pre-ANSI joins specified in the where clause.  Instead of:

	   SELECT x FROM y JOIN z ON y.id = z.id

       It will write:

	   SELECT x FROM y, z WHERE y.id = z.id

       It should properly support left joins, and right joins.	Full outer
       joins are not possible due to the fact that Oracle requires the entire
       query be written to union the results of a left and right join, and by
       the time this module is called to create the where query and table
       definition part of the sql query, it's already too late.

METHODS
       select
	   Overrides DBIx::Class::SQLMaker's select() method, which calls
	   _oracle_joins() to modify the column and table list before calling
	   next::method().

BUGS
       Does not support full outer joins (however neither really does DBIC
       itself)
