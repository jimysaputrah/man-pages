NAME
       CPAN::Kwalify - Interface between CPAN.pm and Kwalify.pm

SYNOPSIS
	 use CPAN::Kwalify;
	 validate($schema_name, $data, $file, $doc);

DESCRIPTION
       _validate($schema_name, $data, $file, $doc)
	   $schema_name is the name of a supported schema. Currently only
	   "distroprefs" is supported. $data is the data to be validated.
	   $file is the absolute path to the file the data are coming from.
	   $doc is the index of the document within $doc that is to be
	   validated. The last two arguments are only there for better error
	   reporting.

	   Relies on being called from within CPAN.pm.

	   Dies if something fails. Does not return anything useful.

       yaml($schema_name)
	   Returns the YAML text of that schema. Dies if something fails.
