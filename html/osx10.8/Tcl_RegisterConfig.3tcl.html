NAME
       Tcl_RegisterConfig  -  procedures  to  register	embedded configuration
       information

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lttcl.h&gt

       void
       Tcl_RegisterConfig(interp, pkgName, configuration, valEncoding)


ARGUMENTS
       Tcl_Interp *interp (in)		       Refers to the  interpreter  the
					       embedded configuration informa-
					       tion is	registered  for.  Must
					       not be NULL.

       const char *pkgName (in) 	       Contains  the name of the pack-
					       age  registering  the  embedded
					       configuration  as ASCII string.
					       This means that	this  informa-
					       tion  is in UTF-8 too. Must not
					       be NULL.

       Tcl_Config *configuration (in)	       Refers to an array of  Tcl_Con-
					       fig   entries   containing  the
					       information  embedded  in   the
					       binary  library.  Must  not  be
					       NULL. The end of the  array  is
					       signaled  by either a key iden-
					       tical to NULL, or a key	refer-
					       ring to the empty string.

       const char *valEncoding (in)	       Contains the name of the encod-
					       ing used to store the  configu-
					       ration  values as ASCII string.
					       This means that	this  informa-
					       tion  is in UTF-8 too. Must not
					       be NULL.

DESCRIPTION
       The function described here has its base in TIP 59 and provides	exten-
       sions  with support for the embedding of configuration information into
       their binary library and the generation of a  Tcl-level	interface  for
       querying this information.

       To  embed configuration information into their binary library an exten-
       sion has to define a non-volatile array of Tcl_Config entries in one if
       its  source  files  and	then  call Tcl_RegisterConfig to register that
       information.

       Tcl_RegisterConfig takes four arguments;  first,  a  reference  to  the
       interpreter  we	are registering the information with, second, the name
       of the package registering  its	configuration  information,  third,  a
       pointer	to  an	array of structures, and fourth a string declaring the
       encoding used by the configuration values.

       The string valEncoding contains the name of an encoding known  to  Tcl.
       All  these  names  are use only characters in the ASCII subset of UTF-8
       and are thus implicitly in the UTF-8 encoding. It is expected that keys
       are legible English text and therefore using the ASCII subset of UTF-8.
       In other words, they are expected to be in UTF-8 too. The values  asso-
       ciated  with the keys can be any string however. For these the contents
       of valEncoding define which encoding was used to represent the  charac-
       ters of the strings.

       Each  element of the configuration array refers to two strings contain-
       ing the key and the value associated with that  key.  The  end  of  the
       array  is  signaled  by either an empty key or a key identical to NULL.
       The function makes no copy of the configuration array. This means  that
       the caller has to make sure that the memory holding this array is never
       released. This is the meaning behind the word  non-volatile  used  ear-
       lier.  The  easiest way to accomplish this is to define a global static
       array of Tcl_Config entries. See the file  "generic/tclPkgConfig.c"  in
       the sources of the Tcl core for an example.

       When called Tcl_RegisterConfig will

       (1)    create  a  namespace  having  the  provided  pkgName, if not yet
	      existing.

       (2)    create the command pkgconfig in that namespace and  link	it  to
	      the  provided  information so that the keys from _configuration_
	      and their associated values can be retrieved  through  calls  to
	      pkgconfig.

       The command pkgconfig will provide two subcommands, list and get:

	      ::pkgName::pkgconfig list
		     Returns  a list containing the names of all defined keys.

	      ::pkgName::pkgconfig get key
		     Returns the configuration value associated with the spec-
		     ified key.

TCL_CONFIG
       The Tcl_Config structure contains the following fields:

	      typedef struct Tcl_Config {
		  const char* key;
		  const char* value;
	      } Tcl_Config;
