NAME
       Mail::DKIM::DkPolicy - represents a DomainKeys Sender Signing Policy
       record

DESCRIPTION
       DomainKeys sender signing policies are described in
       RFC4870(historical). It is a record published in the message sender's
       (i.e. the person who transmitted the message) DNS that describes how
       they sign messages.

CONSTRUCTORS
   fetch() - fetch a sender signing policy from DNS
	 my $policy = Mail::DKIM::DkPolicy-&gtfetch(
			  Protocol =&gt "dns",
			  Sender =&gt 'joe@example.org',
		      );

       The following named arguments are accepted:

       Protocol
	   always specify "dns"

       Author
	   the "author" of the message for which policy is being checked.
	   This is the first email address in the "From" header.  According to
	   RFC 2822, section 3.6.2, the "From" header lists who is responsible
	   for writing the message.

       Sender
	   the "sender" of the message for which policy is being checked.
	   This is the first email address in the "Sender" header, or if there
	   is not a "Sender" header, the "From" header.  According to RFC
	   2822, section 3.6.2, the "Sender" header lists who is responsible
	   for transmitting the message.

       Depending on what type of policy is being checked, both the Sender and
       Author fields may need to be specified.

       If a DNS error or timeout occurs, an exception is thrown.

       Otherwise, a policy object of some sort will be returned.  If no policy
       is actually published, then the "default policy" will be returned.  To
       check when this happens, use

	 my $is_default = $policy-&gtis_implied_default_policy;

   new() - construct a default policy object
	 my $policy = Mail::DKIM::DkPolicy-&gtnew;

   parse() - gets a policy object by parsing a string
	 my $policy = Mail::DKIM::DkPolicy-&gtparse(
			  String =&gt "o=~; t=y"
		      );

METHODS
   apply() - apply the policy to the results of a DKIM verifier
	 my $result = $policy-&gtapply($dkim_verifier);

       The caller must provide an instance of Mail::DKIM::Verifier, one which
       has already been fed the message being verified.

       Possible results are:

       accept
	   The message is approved by the sender signing policy.

       reject
	   The message is rejected by the sender signing policy.

       neutral
	   The message is neither approved nor rejected by the sender signing
	   policy. It can be considered suspicious.

   flags() - get or set the flags (t=) tag
       A vertical-bar separated list of flags.

   is_implied_default_policy() - is this policy implied?
	 my $is_implied = $policy-&gtis_implied_default_policy;

       If you fetch the policy for a particular domain, but that domain does
       not have a policy published, then the "default policy" is in effect.
       Use this method to detect when that happens.

   location() - where the policy was fetched from
       DomainKeys policies only have per-domain policies, so this will be the
       domain where the policy was published.

       If nothing is published for the domain, and the default policy was
       returned instead, the location will be "undef".

   note() - get or set the human readable notes (n=) tag
       Human readable notes regarding the record. Undef if no notes specified.

   policy() - get or set the outbound signing policy (o=) tag
	 my $sp = $policy-&gtpolicy;

       Outbound signing policy for the entity. Possible values are:

       "~" The default. The domain may sign some (but not all) email.

       "-" The domain signs all email.

   signall() - true if policy is "-"
   testing() - checks the testing flag
	 my $testing = $policy-&gttesting;

       If nonzero, the testing flag is set on the signing policy, and the
       verify should not consider a message suspicious based on this policy.
