NAME
       slapd-sock - Socket backend/overlay to slapd

SYNOPSIS
       /etc/openldap/slapd.conf

DESCRIPTION
       The  Socket  backend  to  slapd(8)  uses  an external program to handle
       queries, similarly to slapd-shell(5).  However, in this case the exter-
       nal program listens on a Unix domain socket.  This makes it possible to
       have a pool of processes, which persist between requests.  This	allows
       multithreaded  operation and a higher level of efficiency. The external
       program must have been started independently; slapd(8) itself will  not
       start it.

       This  module  may also be used as an overlay on top of some other data-
       base.  Use as an overlay allows external actions  to  be  triggered  in
       response to operations on the main database.

CONFIGURATION
       These  slapd.conf options apply to the SOCK backend database.  That is,
       they must follow a "database sock" line and come before any  subsequent
       "backend" or "database" lines.  Other database options are described in
       the slapd.conf(5) manual page.

       Alternatively, to use this module as an overlay, these directives  must
       follow an "overlay sock" line within an existing database definition.

       extensions [ binddn | peername | ssf | connid ]*
	      Enables  the  sending  of  additional  meta-attributes with each
	      request.
	      binddn: &ltbound DN&gt
	      peername: IP=&ltaddress&gt:&ltport&gt
	      ssf: &ltSSF value&gt
	      connid: &ltconnection ID&gt

       socketpath &ltpathname&gt
	      Gives the path to a Unix domain socket  to  which  the  commands
	      will be sent and from which replies are received.

	      When  used  as  an  overlay,  these  additional  directives  are
	      defined:

       sockops	 [ bind | unbind | search | compare | modify | modrdn | add  |
       delete ]*
	      Specify which request types to send to the external program. The
	      default is empty (no requests are sent).

       sockresps [ result | search ]*
	      Specify  which  response	types to send to the external program.
	      "result" sends just the results of an operation. "search"  sends
	      all entries that the database returned for a search request. The
	      default is empty (no responses are sent).


PROTOCOL
       The protocol is essentially the same as slapd-shell(5) with  the  addi-
       tion  of  a  newline to terminate the command parameters. The following
       commands are sent:
	      ADD
	      msgid: &ltmessage id&gt
	      &ltrepeat { "suffix:" &ltdatabase suffix DN&gt }&gt
	      &ltentry in LDIF format&gt
	      &ltblank line&gt

	      BIND
	      msgid: &ltmessage id&gt
	      &ltrepeat { "suffix:" &ltdatabase suffix DN&gt }&gt
	      dn: &ltDN&gt
	      method: &ltmethod number&gt
	      credlen: &ltlength of &ltcredentials&gt&gt
	      cred: &ltcredentials&gt
	      &ltblank line&gt

	      COMPARE
	      msgid: &ltmessage id&gt
	      &ltrepeat { "suffix:" &ltdatabase suffix DN&gt }&gt
	      dn: &ltDN&gt
	      &ltattribute&gt: &ltvalue&gt
	      &ltblank line&gt

	      DELETE
	      msgid: &ltmessage id&gt
	      &ltrepeat { "suffix:" &ltdatabase suffix DN&gt }&gt
	      dn: &ltDN&gt
	      &ltblank line&gt

	      MODIFY
	      msgid: &ltmessage id&gt
	      &ltrepeat { "suffix:" &ltdatabase suffix DN&gt }&gt
	      dn: &ltDN&gt
	      &ltrepeat {
		  &lt"add"/"delete"/"replace"&gt: &ltattribute&gt
		  &ltrepeat { &ltattribute&gt: &ltvalue&gt }&gt
		  -
	      }&gt
	      &ltblank line&gt

	      MODRDN
	      msgid: &ltmessage id&gt
	      &ltrepeat { "suffix:" &ltdatabase suffix DN&gt }&gt
	      dn: &ltDN&gt
	      newrdn: &ltnew RDN&gt
	      deleteoldrdn: &lt0 or 1&gt
	      &ltif new superior is specified: "newSuperior: &ltDN&gt"&gt
	      &ltblank line&gt

	      SEARCH
	      msgid: &ltmessage id&gt
	      &ltrepeat { "suffix:" &ltdatabase suffix DN&gt }&gt
	      base: &ltbase DN&gt
	      scope: &lt0-2, see ldap.h&gt
	      deref: &lt0-3, see ldap.h&gt
	      sizelimit: &ltsize limit&gt
	      timelimit: &lttime limit&gt
	      filter: &ltfilter&gt
	      attrsonly: &lt0 or 1&gt
	      attrs: &lt"all" or space-separated attribute list&gt
	      &ltblank line&gt

	      UNBIND
	      msgid: &ltmessage id&gt
	      &ltrepeat { "suffix:" &ltdatabase suffix DN&gt }&gt
	      &ltblank line&gt

       The commands - except unbind - should output:
	      RESULT
	      code: &ltinteger&gt
	      matched: &ltmatched DN&gt
	      info: &lttext&gt
       where only RESULT is mandatory, and then close the socket.  The	search
       RESULT  should  be  preceded  by the entries in LDIF format, each entry
       followed by a blank line.  Lines starting  with	`#'  or  `DEBUG:'  are
       ignored.

       When  used as an overlay, the external program should return a CONTINUE
       response if request processing should continue normally, or  a  regular
       RESULT response if the external program wishes to bypass the underlying
       database.

       If the overlay is configured to send response messages to the  external
       program,  they will appear as an extended RESULT message or as an ENTRY
       message, defined below. The RESULT message is similar to the one above,
       but also includes the msgid and any configured extensions:
	      RESULT
	      msgid: &ltmessage id&gt
	      code: &ltinteger&gt
	      matched: &ltmatched DN&gt
	      info: &lttext&gt
	      &ltblank line&gt

       Typically  both	the  msgid  and  the  connid will be needed to match a
       result message to a request. The ENTRY message has the form
	      ENTRY
	      msgid: &ltmessage id&gt
	      &ltentry in LDIF format&gt
	      &ltblank line&gt


ACCESS CONTROL
       The sock backend does not honor	all  ACL  semantics  as  described  in
       slapd.access(5).   In  general, access to objects is checked by using a
       dummy object that contains only the DN, so access rules	that  rely  on
       the contents of the object are not honored.  In detail:

       The  add  operation  does not require write (=w) access to the children
       pseudo-attribute of the parent entry.

       The bind operation requires auth  (=x)  access  to  the	entry  pseudo-
       attribute  of  the  entry  whose  identity is being assessed; auth (=x)
       access to the credentials is not checked, but rather delegated  to  the
       underlying program.

       The compare operation requires compare (=c) access to the entry pseudo-
       attribute of the object whose value is  being  asserted;  compare  (=c)
       access to the attribute whose value is being asserted is not checked.

       The delete operation does not require write (=w) access to the children
       pseudo-attribute of the parent entry.

       The modify operation requires write (=w) access to  the	entry  pseudo-
       attribute;  write (=w) access to the specific attributes that are modi-
       fied is not checked.

       The modrdn operation does not require write (=w) access to the children
       pseudo-attribute of the parent entry, nor to that of the new parent, if
       different; write (=w) access to the distinguished values of the	naming
       attributes is not checked.

       The  search  operation does not require search (=s) access to the entry
       pseudo_attribute  of  the  searchBase;  search  (=s)  access   to   the
       attributes and values used in the filter is not checked.

       OpenLDAP source tree.
