AU_BSM_TO_ERRNO(3)	 BSD Library Functions Manual	    AU_BSM_TO_ERRNO(3)

NAME
     au_bsm_to_errno, au_errno_to_bsm, au_strerror -- convert between BSM and
     local error numbers

LIBRARY
     Basic Security Module Library (libbsm, -lbsm)

SYNOPSIS
     #include &ltbsm/libbsm.h&gt

     int
     au_bsm_to_errno(u_char bsm_error, int *errorp);

     u_char
     au_errno_to_bsm(int error);

     const char *
     au_strerror(int bsm_error);

DESCRIPTION
     These interfaces may be used to convert between the local ( errno(2)) and
     BSM error number spaces found in BSM return tokens.

     The au_bsm_to_errno() function accepts a BSM error value, bsm_error, and
     converts it to an errno(2) that will be stored in the integer pointed to
     by errorp if successful.  This call will fail if the BSM error cannot be
     mapped into a local error number, which may occur if the return token was
     generated on another operating system.

     The au_errno_to_bsm() function accepts a local errno(2) value, and
     returns the BSM error number for it.  This call cannot fail, and instead
     returns a BSM error number indicating to a later decoder that the error
     could not be encoded.

     The au_strerror() function converts a BSM error value to a string, gener-
     ally by converting first to a local error number and using the local
     strerror(3) function, but will also work for errors that are not locally
     defined.

RETURN VALULES
     On success, au_bsm_to_errno() returns 0 and a converted error value; on
     failure, it returns -1 but does not set errno(2).

     On success, au_strerror() returns a pointer to an error string; on fail-
     ure it will return NULL.

SEE ALSO

HISTORY
     au_bsm_to_errno() and au_errno_to_bsm() were introduced in OpenBSM 1.1.

AUTHORS
     These functions were implemented by Robert Watson under contract to Apple
     Inc.

     The Basic Security Module (BSM) interface to audit records and audit
     event stream format were defined by Sun Microsystems.

BUGS
     au_strerror is unable to provide localized strings for errors not avail-
     able in the local operating system.
