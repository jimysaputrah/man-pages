NAME
       glInitNames - initialize the name stack


C SPECIFICATION
       void glInitNames( void )


DESCRIPTION
       The name stack is used during selection mode to allow sets of rendering
       commands to be uniquely identified.  It consists of an ordered  set  of
       unsigned integers.  glInitNames causes the name stack to be initialized
       to its default empty state.

       The name stack is always empty while the render mode is not  GL_SELECT.
       Calls  to  glInitNames  while  the  render  mode  is  not GL_SELECT are
       ignored.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if glInitNames  is  executed  between
       the execution of glBegin and the corresponding execution of glEnd.

ASSOCIATED GETS
       glGet with argument GL_NAME_STACK_DEPTH
       glGet with argument GL_MAX_NAME_STACK_DEPTH

SEE ALSO
