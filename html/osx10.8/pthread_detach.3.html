PTHREAD_DETACH(3)	 BSD Library Functions Manual	     PTHREAD_DETACH(3)

NAME
     pthread_detach -- detach a thread

SYNOPSIS
     #include &ltpthread.h&gt

     int
     pthread_detach(pthread_t thread);

DESCRIPTION
     The pthread_detach() function is used to indicate to the implementation
     that storage for the thread thread can be reclaimed when the thread ter-
     minates.  If thread has not terminated, pthread_detach() will not cause
     it to terminate.  The effect of multiple pthread_detach() calls on the
     same target thread is unspecified.

RETURN VALUES
     If successful,  the pthread_detach() function will return zero.  Other-
     wise, an error number will be returned to indicate the error.  Note that
     the function does not change the value of errno, as it did for some
     drafts of the standard.  These early drafts also passed a pointer to
     pthread_t as the argument.  Beware!

ERRORS
     pthread_detach() will fail if:

     [EINVAL]		The implementation has detected that the value speci-
			fied by thread does not refer to a joinable thread.

     [ESRCH]		No thread could be found corresponding to that speci-
			fied by the given thread ID, thread.

SEE ALSO
     pthread_join(3)

STANDARDS
     pthread_detach() conforms to ISO/IEC 9945-1:1996 (``POSIX.1'').
