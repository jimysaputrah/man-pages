NAME
       Moose::Cookbook - How to cook a Moose

VERSION
       version 2.0205

DESCRIPTION
       The Moose cookbook is a series of recipes showing various Moose
       features. Most recipes present some code demonstrating some feature,
       and then explain the details of the code.

       You should probably read the Moose::Manual first. The manual explains
       Moose concepts without being too code-heavy.

RECIPES
   Basic Moose
       These recipes will give you a good overview of Moose's capabilities,
       starting with simple attribute declaration, and moving on to more
       powerful features like laziness, types, type coercion, method
       modifiers, and more.

       Moose::Cookbook::Basics::Recipe1 - The (always classic) Point example
	   A simple Moose-based class. Demonstrates Moose attributes and
	   subclassing.

       Moose::Cookbook::Basics::Recipe2 - A simple BankAccount example
	   A slightly more complex Moose class. Demonstrates using a method
	   modifier in a subclass.

       Moose::Cookbook::Basics::Recipe3 - A lazy BinaryTree example
	   Demonstrates several attribute features, including types, weak
	   references, predicates ("does this object have a foo?"), defaults,
	   laziness, and triggers.

       Moose::Cookbook::Basics::Recipe4 - Subtypes, and modeling a simple
       Company class hierarchy
	   Introduces the creation and use of custom types, a "BUILD" method,
	   and the use of "override" in a subclass.

       Moose::Cookbook::Basics::Recipe5 - More subtypes, coercion in a Request
       class
	   More type examples, including the use of type coercions.

       Moose::Cookbook::Basics::Recipe6 - The augment/inner example
	   Demonstrates the use of "augment" method modifiers, a way of
	   turning the usual method overriding style "inside-out".

       Moose::Cookbook::Basics::Recipe7 - Making Moose fast with immutable
	   Making a class immutable greatly increases the speed of accessors
	   and object construction.

       Moose::Cookbook::Basics::Recipe8 - Builder methods and lazy_build
	   The builder feature provides an inheritable and role-composable way
	   to provide a default attribute value.

       Moose::Cookbook::Basics::Recipe9 - Operator overloading, subtypes, and
       coercion
	   Demonstrates using operator overloading, coercion, and subtypes to
	   model how eye color is determined during reproduction.

       Moose::Cookbook::Basics::Recipe10 - Using BUILDARGS and BUILD to hook
       into object construction
	   This recipe demonstrates the use of "BUILDARGS" and "BUILD" to hook
	   into object construction.

       Moose::Cookbook::Basics::Recipe11 - Extending a non-Moose base class
	   In this recipe, we make a Moose-based subclass of DateTime, a
	   module which does not use Moose itself.

   Moose Roles
       These recipes will show you how to use Moose roles.

       Moose::Cookbook::Roles::Recipe1 - The Moose::Role example
	   Demonstrates roles, which are also sometimes known as traits or
	   mix-ins. Roles provide a method of code re-use which is orthogonal
	   to subclassing.

       Moose::Cookbook::Roles::Recipe2 - Advanced Role Composition - method
       exclusion and aliasing
	   Sometimes you just want to include part of a role in your class.
	   Sometimes you want the whole role but one of its methods conflicts
	   with one in your class. With method exclusion and aliasing, you can
	   work around these problems.

       Moose::Cookbook::Roles::Recipe3 - Applying a role to an object instance
	   In this recipe, we apply a role to an existing object instance.

   Meta Moose
       These recipes show you how to write your own meta classes, which lets
       you extend the object system provided by Moose.

       Moose::Cookbook::Meta::Recipe1 - Welcome to the meta-world (Why Go
       Meta?)
	   If you're wondering what all this "meta" stuff is, and why you
	   should care about it, read this "recipe".

       Moose::Cookbook::Meta::Recipe2 - A meta-attribute, attributes with
       labels
	   One way to extend Moose is to provide your own attribute
	   metaclasses. Attribute metaclasses let you extend attribute
	   declarations (with "has") and behavior to provide additional
	   attribute functionality.

       Moose::Cookbook::Meta::Recipe3 - Labels implemented via attribute
       traits
	   Extending Moose's attribute metaclass is a great way to add
	   functionality. However, attributes can only have one metaclass.
	   Applying roles to the attribute metaclass lets you provide
	   composable attribute functionality.

       Moose::Cookbook::Meta::Recipe4 - Adding a "table" attribute to the
       metaclass
	   If you want to store more information about your classes, you'll
	   have to extend "Moose::Meta::Class". Doing so is simple, but you'll
	   probably also want to provide some sugar, so see
	   Moose::Cookbook::Extending::Recipe2 as well.

       Moose::Cookbook::Meta::Recipe5 - The "table" attribute implemented as a
       metaclass trait
	   This recipe takes the class metaclass we saw in the previous recipe
	   and reimplements it as a metaclass trait.

       Moose::Cookbook::Meta::Recipe6 - A method metaclass for marking methods
       public or private
	   This recipe shows a custom method metaclass that implements making
	   a method private.

       Moose::Cookbook::Meta::Recipe7 - Using a blessed array reference as an
       object instance
	   This recipe shows an example of how you create your own meta-
	   instance class. The meta-instance determines the internal structure
	   of object instances and provide access to attribute slots.

       Moose::Cookbook::Meta::Recipe8 - Hooking into immutabilization (TODO)
	   Moose has a feature known as "immutabilization". By calling
	   "__PACKAGE__-&gtmeta()-&gtmake_immutable()" after defining your class
	   (attributes, roles, etc), you tell Moose to optimize things like
	   object creation, attribute access, and so on.

	   If you are creating your own metaclasses, you may need to hook into
	   the immutabilization system. This cuts across a number of spots,
	   including the metaclass class, meta method classes, and possibly
	   the meta-instance class as well.

	   This recipe shows you how to write extensions which immutabilize
	   properly.

   Extending Moose
       These recipes cover some more ways to extend Moose, and will be useful
       if you plan to write your own "MooseX" module.

       Moose::Cookbook::Extending::Recipe1 - Moose extension overview
	   There are quite a few ways to extend Moose. This recipe provides an
	   overview of each method, and provides recommendations for when each
	   is appropriate.

       Moose::Cookbook::Extending::Recipe2 - Providing a base object class
       role
	   Many base object class extensions can be implemented as roles. This
	   example shows how to provide a base object class debugging role
	   that is applied to any class that uses a notional
	   "MooseX::Debugging" module.

       Moose::Cookbook::Extending::Recipe3 - Providing an alternate base
       object class
	   You may find that you want to provide an alternate base object
	   class along with a meta extension, or maybe you just want to add
	   some functionality to all your classes without typing "extends
	   'MyApp::Base'" over and over.

       Moose::Cookbook::Extending::Recipe4 - Acting like Moose.pm and
       providing sugar Moose-style
	   This recipe shows how to provide a replacement for "Moose.pm". You
	   may want to do this as part of the API for a "MooseX" module,
	   especially if you want to default to a new metaclass class or base
	   object class.
