NAME
       Mail::DKIM::Canonicalization::Base - base class for canonicalization
       methods

SYNOPSIS
	 # canonicalization results get output to STDOUT
	 my $method = new Mail::DKIM::Canonicalization::relaxed(
			   output_fh => *STDOUT,
			   Signature => $dkim_signature);

	 # add headers
	 $method->add_header("Subject: this is the subject\015\012");
	 $method->finish_header(Headers => \@all_headers);

	 # add body
	 $method->add_body("This is the body.\015\012");
	 $method->add_body("Another two lines\015\012of the body.\015\012");
	 $method->finish_body;

	 # this adds the signature to the end
	 $method->finish_message;

CONSTRUCTOR
       Use the new() method of the desired canonicalization implementation
       class to construct a canonicalization object. E.g.

	 my $method = new Mail::DKIM::Canonicalization::relaxed(
			   output_fh => *STDOUT,
			   Signature => $dkim_signature);

       The constructors accept these arguments:

       Signature
	   (Required) Provide the DKIM signature being constructed (if the
	   message is being signed), or the DKIM signature being verified (if
	   the message is being verified). The canonicalization method either
	   writes parameters to the signature, or reads parameters from the
	   signature (e.g. the h= tag).

       output
	   If specified, the canonicalized message will be passed to this
	   object with the PRINT method.

       output_digest
	   If specified, the canonicalized message will be added to this
	   digest.  (Uses the add() method.)

       output_fh
	   If specified, the canonicalized message will be written to this
	   file handle.

       If none of the output parameters are specified, then the canonicalized
       message is appended to an internal buffer. The contents of this buffer
       can be accessed using the result() method.

METHODS
   add_body() - feeds part of the body into the canonicalization
	 $method->add_body("This is the body.\015\012");
	 $method->add_body("Another two lines\015\012of the body.\015\012");

       The body should be fed one or more "lines" at a time.  I.e. do not feed
       part of a line.

   finish_header() - called when the header has been completely parsed
	 $method->finish_header(Headers => \@all_headers);

       Formerly the canonicalization object would only get the header data
       through successive invocations of add_header(). However, that required
       the canonicalization object to store a copy of the entire header so
       that it could choose the order in which headers were fed to the digest
       object. This is inefficient use of memory, since a message with many
       signatures may use many canonicalization objects and each
       canonicalization object has its own copy of the header.

       The headers array is an array of one element per header field, with the
       headers not processed/canonicalized in any way.

   result()
	 my $result = $method->result;

       If you did not specify an object or handle to send the output to, the
       result of the canonicalization is stored in the canonicalization method
       itself, and can be accessed using this method.
