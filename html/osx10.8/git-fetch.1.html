NAME
       git-fetch - Download objects and refs from another repository

SYNOPSIS
       git fetch [&ltoptions&gt] [&ltrepository&gt [&ltrefspec&gt...]]
       git fetch [&ltoptions&gt] &ltgroup&gt
       git fetch --multiple [&ltoptions&gt] [(&ltrepository&gt | &ltgroup&gt)...]
       git fetch --all [&ltoptions&gt]


DESCRIPTION
       Fetches named heads or tags from one or more other repositories, along
       with the objects necessary to complete them.

       The ref names and their object names of fetched refs are stored in
       .git/FETCH_HEAD. This information is left for a later merge operation
       done by git merge.

       When &ltrefspec&gt stores the fetched result in remote-tracking branches,
       the tags that point at these branches are automatically followed. This
       is done by first fetching from the remote using the given &ltrefspec&gts,
       and if the repository has objects that are pointed by remote tags that
       it does not yet have, then fetch those missing tags. If the other end
       has tags that point at branches you are not interested in, you will not
       get them.

       git fetch can fetch from either a single named repository, or from
       several repositories at once if &ltgroup&gt is given and there is a
       remotes.&ltgroup&gt entry in the configuration file. (See git-config(1)).

OPTIONS
       --all
	   Fetch all remotes.

       -a, --append
	   Append ref names and object names of fetched refs to the existing
	   contents of .git/FETCH_HEAD. Without this option old data in
	   .git/FETCH_HEAD will be overwritten.

       --depth=&ltdepth&gt
	   Deepen the history of a shallow repository created by git clone
	   with --depth=&ltdepth&gt option (see git-clone(1)) by the specified
	   number of commits.

       --dry-run
	   Show what would be done, without making any changes.

       -f, --force
	   When git fetch is used with &ltrbranch&gt:&ltlbranch&gt refspec, it refuses
	   to update the local branch &ltlbranch&gt unless the remote branch
	   &ltrbranch&gt it fetches is a descendant of &ltlbranch&gt. This option
	   overrides that check.

       -k, --keep
	   Keep downloaded pack.

       --multiple
	   Allow several &ltrepository&gt and &ltgroup&gt arguments to be specified.
	   No &ltrefspec&gts may be specified.

       -p, --prune
	   After fetching, remove any remote-tracking branches which no longer
	   exist on the remote.

       -n, --no-tags
	   By default, tags that point at objects that are downloaded from the
	   remote repository are fetched and stored locally. This option
	   disables this automatic tag following. The default behavior for a
	   remote may be specified with the remote.&ltname&gt.tagopt setting. See
	   git-config(1).

       -t, --tags
	   Most of the tags are fetched automatically as branch heads are
	   downloaded, but tags that do not point at objects reachable from
	   the branch heads that are being tracked will not be fetched by this
	   mechanism. This flag lets all tags and their associated objects be
	   downloaded. The default behavior for a remote may be specified with
	   the remote.&ltname&gt.tagopt setting. See git-config(1).

       --recurse-submodules[=yes|on-demand|no]
	   This option controls if and under what conditions new commits of
	   populated submodules should be fetched too. It can be used as a
	   boolean option to completely disable recursion when set to no or to
	   unconditionally recurse into all populated submodules when set to
	   yes, which is the default when this option is used without any
	   value. Use on-demand to only recurse into a populated submodule
	   when the superproject retrieves a commit that updates the
	   submodule's reference to a commit that isn't already in the local
	   submodule clone.

       --no-recurse-submodules
	   Disable recursive fetching of submodules (this has the same effect
	   as using the --recurse-submodules=no option).

       --submodule-prefix=&ltpath&gt
	   Prepend &ltpath&gt to paths printed in informative messages such as
	   "Fetching submodule foo". This option is used internally when
	   recursing over submodules.

       --recurse-submodules-default=[yes|on-demand]
	   This option is used internally to temporarily provide a
	   non-negative default value for the --recurse-submodules option. All
	   other methods of configuring fetch's submodule recursion (such as
	   settings in gitmodules(5) and git-config(1)) override this option,
	   as does specifying --[no-]recurse-submodules directly.

       -u, --update-head-ok
	   By default git fetch refuses to update the head which corresponds
	   to the current branch. This flag disables the check. This is purely
	   for the internal use for git pull to communicate with git fetch,
	   and unless you are implementing your own Porcelain you are not
	   supposed to use it.

       --upload-pack &ltupload-pack&gt
	   When given, and the repository to fetch from is handled by git
	   fetch-pack, --exec=&ltupload-pack&gt is passed to the command to
	   specify non-default path for the command run on the other end.

       -q, --quiet
	   Pass --quiet to git-fetch-pack and silence any other internally
	   used git commands. Progress is not reported to the standard error
	   stream.

       -v, --verbose
	   Be verbose.

       --progress
	   Progress status is reported on the standard error stream by default
	   when it is attached to a terminal, unless -q is specified. This
	   flag forces progress status even if the standard error stream is
	   not directed to a terminal.

       &ltrepository&gt
	   The "remote" repository that is the source of a fetch or pull
	   operation. This parameter can be either a URL (see the section GIT
	   URLS below) or the name of a remote (see the section REMOTES
	   below).

       &ltgroup&gt
	   A name referring to a list of repositories as the value of
	   remotes.&ltgroup&gt in the configuration file. (See git-config(1)).

       &ltrefspec&gt
	   The format of a &ltrefspec&gt parameter is an optional plus +, followed
	   by the source ref &ltsrc&gt, followed by a colon :, followed by the
	   destination ref &ltdst&gt.

	   The remote ref that matches &ltsrc&gt is fetched, and if &ltdst&gt is not
	   empty string, the local ref that matches it is fast-forwarded using
	   &ltsrc&gt. If the optional plus + is used, the local ref is updated
	   even if it does not result in a fast-forward update.

	       Note
	       If the remote branch from which you want to pull is modified in
	       non-linear ways such as being rewound and rebased frequently,
	       then a pull will attempt a merge with an older version of
	       itself, likely conflict, and fail. It is under these conditions
	       that you would want to use the + sign to indicate
	       non-fast-forward updates will be needed. There is currently no
	       easy way to determine or declare that a branch will be made
	       available in a repository with this behavior; the pulling user
	       simply must know this is the expected usage pattern for a
	       branch.

	       Note
	       You never do your own development on branches that appear on
	       the right hand side of a &ltrefspec&gt colon on Pull: lines; they
	       are to be updated by git fetch. If you intend to do development
	       derived from a remote branch B, have a Pull: line to track it
	       (i.e.  Pull: B:remote-B), and have a separate branch my-B to do
	       your development on top of it. The latter is created by git
	       branch my-B remote-B (or its equivalent git checkout -b my-B
	       remote-B). Run git fetch to keep track of the progress of the
	       remote side, and when you see something new on the remote
	       branch, merge it into your development branch with git pull .
	       remote-B, while you are on my-B branch.

	       Note
	       There is a difference between listing multiple &ltrefspec&gt
	       directly on git pull command line and having multiple Pull:
	       &ltrefspec&gt lines for a &ltrepository&gt and running git pull command
	       without any explicit &ltrefspec&gt parameters. &ltrefspec&gt listed
	       explicitly on the command line are always merged into the
	       current branch after fetching. In other words, if you list more
	       than one remote refs, you would be making an Octopus. While git
	       pull run without any explicit &ltrefspec&gt parameter takes default
	       &ltrefspec&gts from Pull: lines, it merges only the first &ltrefspec&gt
	       found into the current branch, after fetching all the remote
	       refs. This is because making an Octopus from remote refs is
	       rarely done, while keeping track of multiple remote heads in
	       one-go by fetching more than one is often useful.
	   Some short-cut notations are also supported.

	   o	tag &lttag&gt means the same as refs/tags/&lttag&gt:refs/tags/&lttag&gt;
	       it requests fetching everything up to the given tag.

	   o   A parameter &ltref&gt without a colon is equivalent to &ltref&gt: when
	       pulling/fetching, so it merges &ltref&gt into the current branch
	       without storing the remote branch anywhere locally

GIT URLS
       In general, URLs contain information about the transport protocol, the
       address of the remote server, and the path to the repository. Depending
       on the transport protocol, some of this information may be absent.

       Git natively supports ssh, git, http, https, ftp, ftps, and rsync
       protocols. The following syntaxes may be used with them:

       o   ssh://[user@]host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/

       o   git://host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/

       o   http[s]://host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/

       o   ftp[s]://host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/

       o   rsync://host.xz/path/to/repo.git/

       An alternative scp-like syntax may also be used with the ssh protocol:

       o   [user@]host.xz:path/to/repo.git/

       The ssh and git protocols additionally support ~username expansion:

       o   ssh://[user@]host.xz[:port]/~[user]/path/to/repo.git/

       o   git://host.xz[:port]/~[user]/path/to/repo.git/

       o   [user@]host.xz:/~[user]/path/to/repo.git/

       For local repositories, also supported by git natively, the following
       syntaxes may be used:

       o   /path/to/repo.git/

       o    file:///path/to/repo.git/

       These two syntaxes are mostly equivalent, except when cloning, when the
       former implies --local option. See git-clone(1) for details.

       When git doesn't know how to handle a certain transport protocol, it
       attempts to use the remote-&lttransport&gt remote helper, if one exists. To
       explicitly request a remote helper, the following syntax may be used:

       o   &lttransport&gt::&ltaddress&gt

       where &ltaddress&gt may be a path, a server and path, or an arbitrary
       URL-like string recognized by the specific remote helper being invoked.
       See git-remote-helpers(1) for details.

       If there are a large number of similarly-named remote repositories and
       you want to use a different format for them (such that the URLs you use
       will be rewritten into URLs that work), you can create a configuration
       section of the form:

		   [url "&ltactual url base&gt"]
			   insteadOf = &ltother url base&gt


       For example, with this:

		   [url "git://git.host.xz/"]
			   insteadOf = host.xz:/path/to/
			   insteadOf = work:


       a URL like "work:repo.git" or like "host.xz:/path/to/repo.git" will be
       rewritten in any context that takes a URL to be
       "git://git.host.xz/repo.git".

       If you want to rewrite URLs for push only, you can create a
       configuration section of the form:

		   [url "&ltactual url base&gt"]
			   pushInsteadOf = &ltother url base&gt


       For example, with this:

		   [url "ssh://example.org/"]
			   pushInsteadOf = git://example.org/


       a URL like "git://example.org/path/to/repo.git" will be rewritten to
       "ssh://example.org/path/to/repo.git" for pushes, but pulls will still
       use the original URL.

REMOTES
       The name of one of the following can be used instead of a URL as
       &ltrepository&gt argument:

       o   a remote in the git configuration file: $GIT_DIR/config,

       o   a file in the $GIT_DIR/remotes directory, or

       o   a file in the $GIT_DIR/branches directory.

       All of these also allow you to omit the refspec from the command line
       because they each contain a refspec which git will use by default.

   Named remote in configuration file
       You can choose to provide the name of a remote which you had previously
       configured using git-remote(1), git-config(1) or even by a manual edit
       to the $GIT_DIR/config file. The URL of this remote will be used to
       access the repository. The refspec of this remote will be used by
       default when you do not provide a refspec on the command line. The
       entry in the config file would appear like this:

		   [remote "&ltname&gt"]
			   url = &lturl&gt
			   pushurl = &ltpushurl&gt
			   push = &ltrefspec&gt
			   fetch = &ltrefspec&gt


       The &ltpushurl&gt is used for pushes only. It is optional and defaults to
       &lturl&gt.

   Named file in $GIT_DIR/remotes
       You can choose to provide the name of a file in $GIT_DIR/remotes. The
       URL in this file will be used to access the repository. The refspec in
       this file will be used as default when you do not provide a refspec on
       the command line. This file should have the following format:

		   URL: one of the above URL format
		   Push: &ltrefspec&gt
		   Pull: &ltrefspec&gt


       Push: lines are used by git push and Pull: lines are used by git pull
       and git fetch. Multiple Push: and Pull: lines may be specified for
       additional branch mappings.

   Named file in $GIT_DIR/branches
       You can choose to provide the name of a file in $GIT_DIR/branches. The
       URL in this file will be used to access the repository. This file
       should have the following format:

		   &lturl&gt#&lthead&gt


       &lturl&gt is required; #&lthead&gt is optional.

       Depending on the operation, git will use one of the following refspecs,
       if you don't provide one on the command line. &ltbranch&gt is the name of
       this file in $GIT_DIR/branches and &lthead&gt defaults to master.

       git fetch uses:

		   refs/heads/&lthead&gt:refs/heads/&ltbranch&gt


       git push uses:

		   HEAD:refs/heads/&lthead&gt


EXAMPLES
       o   Update the remote-tracking branches:

	       $ git fetch origin

	   The above command copies all branches from the remote refs/heads/
	   namespace and stores them to the local refs/remotes/origin/
	   namespace, unless the branch.&ltname&gt.fetch option is used to specify
	   a non-default refspec.

       o   Using refspecs explicitly:

	       $ git fetch origin +pu:pu maint:tmp

	   This updates (or creates, as necessary) branches pu and tmp in the
	   local repository by fetching from the branches (respectively) pu
	   and maint from the remote repository.

	   The pu branch will be updated even if it is does not fast-forward,
	   because it is prefixed with a plus sign; tmp will not be.

BUGS
       Using --recurse-submodules can only fetch new commits in already
       checked out submodules right now. When e.g. upstream added a new
       submodule in the just fetched commits of the superproject the submodule
       itself can not be fetched, making it impossible to check out that
       submodule later without having to do a fetch again. This is expected to
       be fixed in a future git version.
