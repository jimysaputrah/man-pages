RADMIN(8)	     FreeRADIUS Server Administration Tool	     RADMIN(8)



NAME
       radmin - FreeRADIUS Administration tool

SYNOPSIS
       radmin  [-d  config_directory]  [-e command] [-E] [-f socket_file] [-h]
       [-i input_file] [-n name] [-o output_file] [-q]

DESCRIPTION
       FreeRADIUS Server administration tool  that  connects  to  the  control
       socket of a running server, and gives a command-line interface to it.

       At this time, only a few commands are supported.  Please type "help" at
       the command prompt for detailed information about  the  supported  com-
       mands.

WARNING
       The  security  protections  offered  by this command are limited to the
       permissions on the Unix domain socket, and  the	server	configuration.
       If  someone can connect to the Unix domain socket, they have a substan-
       tial amount of control over the server.

OPTIONS
       The following command-line options are accepted by the program.

       -d config directory
	      Defaults to /etc/raddb. radmin looks here for the server config-
	      uration files to find the "listen" section that defines the con-
	      trol socket filename.

       -e command
	      Run command and exit.

       -E     Echo commands as they are being executed.

       -f socket_file
	      Specify the socket filename directly.  The radiusd.conf file  is
	      not read.

       -h     Print usage help information.

       -i input_file
	      Reads input from the specified file.  If not specified, stdin is
	      used.  This also sets "-q".

       -n mname
	      Read raddb/name.conf instead of raddb/radiusd.conf.

       -o output_file
	      Write output to the specified file.  If not specified, stdout is
	      used.  This also sets "-q".

       -q     Quiet mode.

COMMANDS
       The  commands implemented by the command-line interface are almost com-
       pletely controlled by the server.  There are a few commands interpreted
       locally by radmin:

       reconnect
	      Reconnect to the server.

       quit   Exit from radmin.

       exit   Exit from radmin.

       The  other  commands are implemented by the server.  Type "help" at the
       prompt for more information.

EXAMPLES
       debug file /var/log/radius/bob.log
	      Set debug logs to /var/log/radius/bob.log.  There is very little
	      checking of this filename.  Rogue administrators may be able use
	      this command to over-write almost any file on  the  system.   If
	      those  administrators  have  write access to "radius.conf", they
	      can do the same thing without radmin, too.

       debug condition '(User-Name == "bob")'
	      Enable debugging output for all requests that match  the	condi-
	      tion.   Any  "unlang" condition is valid here.  The condition is
	      parsed as a string, so it must be enclosed in single  or	double
	      quotes.	Strings  enclosed  in  double-quotes  must  have back-
	      slashes and the quotation marks escaped inside of the string.

	      Only one debug condition can be active at a time.

       debug condition '((User-Name == "bob") || (Packet-Src-IP-
       Address == 192.0.2.22))'
	      A more complex  condition  that  enables	debugging  output  for
	      requests	containing User-Name "bob", or requests that originate
	      from source IP address 192.0.2.22.

       debug condition
	      Disable debug conditionals.
