NAME
       README.riscos - Perl version 5 for RISC OS

DESCRIPTION
       This document gives instructions for building Perl for RISC OS. It is
       complicated by the need to cross compile. There is a binary version of
       perl available from &lthttp://www.cp15.org/perl/&gt which you may wish to
       use instead of trying to compile it yourself.

BUILD
       You need an installed and working gccsdk cross compiler
       &lthttp://gccsdk.riscos.info/&gt and REXEN
       &lthttp://www.cp15.org/programming/&gt

       Firstly, copy the source and build a native copy of perl for your host
       system.	Then, in the source to be cross compiled:

       o

	       $ ./Configure

       o   Select the riscos hint file. The default answers for the rest of
	   the questions are usually sufficient.

	   Note that, if you wish to run Configure non-interactively (see the
	   INSTALL document for details), to have it select the correct hint
	   file, you'll need to provide the argument -Dhintfile=riscos on the
	   Configure command-line.

       o

	       $ make miniperl

       o   This should build miniperl and then fail when it tries to run it.

       o   Copy the miniperl executable from the native build done earlier to
	   replace the cross compiled miniperl.

       o

	       $ make

       o   This will use miniperl to complete the rest of the build.
