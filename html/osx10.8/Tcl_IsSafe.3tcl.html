DESCRIPTION
       These  procedures  are  intended for access to the multiple interpreter
       facility from inside C programs. They enable managing  multiple	inter-
       preters	in a hierarchical relationship, and the management of aliases,
       commands that when invoked in one  interpreter  execute	a  command  in
       another	interpreter. The return value for those procedures that return
       an int is either TCL_OK or TCL_ERROR. If TCL_ERROR is returned then the
       result field of the interpreter contains an error message.

       Tcl_CreateSlave	creates  a  new  interpreter as a slave of interp.  It
       also creates a slave command named slaveName  in  interp  which	allows
       interp  to  manipulate  the  new slave.	If isSafe is zero, the command
       creates a trusted slave in which Tcl code has access  to  all  the  Tcl
       commands.   If it is 1, the command creates a "safe" slave in which Tcl
       code has access only to set of Tcl commands defined as "Safe Tcl";  see
       the  manual  entry for the Tcl interp command for details.  If the cre-
       ation of the new slave interpreter failed, NULL is returned.

       Tcl_IsSafe returns  1  if  interp  is  "safe"  (was  created  with  the
       TCL_SAFE_INTERPRETER flag specified), 0 otherwise.

       Tcl_MakeSafe marks interp as "safe", so that future calls to Tcl_IsSafe
       will return 1.  It also removes all known potentially-unsafe core func-
       tionality  (both commands and variables) from interp.  However, it can-
       not know what parts of an extension or application are  safe  and  does
       not make any attempt to remove those parts, so safety is not guaranteed
       after calling Tcl_MakeSafe.  Callers will want to take care with  their
       use  of	Tcl_MakeSafe to avoid false claims of safety.  For many situa-
       tions, Tcl_CreateSlave may be a better choice, since it creates	inter-
       preters in a known-safe state.

       Tcl_GetSlave  returns  a  pointer to a slave interpreter of interp. The
       slave interpreter is identified by slaveName.  If no such slave	inter-
       preter exists, NULL is returned.

       Tcl_GetMaster returns a pointer to the master interpreter of interp. If
       interp has no master (it is  a  top-level  interpreter)	then  NULL  is
       returned.

       Tcl_GetInterpPath sets the result field in askingInterp to the relative
       path between askingInterp and slaveInterp; slaveInterp must be a  slave
       of  askingInterp.  If  the  computation	of the relative path succeeds,
       TCL_OK is returned, else TCL_ERROR is returned and the result field  in
       askingInterp contains the error message.

       Tcl_CreateAlias creates an object command named slaveCmd in slaveInterp
       that when invoked, will cause the command targetCmd to  be  invoked  in
       targetInterp.  The arguments specified by the strings contained in argv
       are always prepended to any arguments supplied  in  the	invocation  of
       slaveCmd  and passed to targetCmd.  This operation returns TCL_OK if it
       succeeds, or TCL_ERROR if it fails; in that case, an error  message  is
       left  in  the  object  result  of  slaveInterp.	Note that there are no
       restrictions on the  ancestry  relationship  (as  created  by  Tcl_Cre-
       ateSlave)  between  slaveInterp	and targetInterp. Any two interpreters
       can be used, without any restrictions on how they are related.

       Tcl_CreateAliasObj is similar to Tcl_CreateAlias except that it takes a
       vector  of  objects to pass as additional arguments instead of a vector
       of strings.

       Tcl_GetAlias returns information about an alias	aliasName  in  interp.
       Any  of	the result fields can be NULL, in which case the corresponding
       datum is not returned. If a result field is non-NULL, the address indi-
       cated is set to the corresponding datum.  For example, if targetNamePtr
       is non-NULL it is set to a pointer to the string containing the name of
       the target command.

       Tcl_GetAliasObj	is  similar  to  Tcl_GetAlias except that it returns a
       pointer to a vector of  Tcl_Obj	structures  instead  of  a  vector  of
       strings.

       Tcl_ExposeCommand moves the command named hiddenCmdName from the set of
       hidden commands to the set of exposed commands, putting	it  under  the
       name  cmdName.	HiddenCmdName  must  be the name of an existing hidden
       command, or the operation will return TCL_ERROR and leave an error mes-
       sage  in  the result field in interp.  If an exposed command named cmd-
       Name already exists, the operation  returns  TCL_ERROR  and  leaves  an
       error  message  in  the object result of interp.  If the operation suc-
       ceeds, it returns TCL_OK.  After executing this	command,  attempts  to
       use  cmdName  in  a  call to Tcl_Eval or with the Tcl eval command will
       again succeed.

       Tcl_HideCommand moves the command named cmdName from the set of exposed
       commands  to  the set of hidden commands, under the name hiddenCmdName.
       CmdName must be the name of an existing exposed command, or the	opera-
       tion  will  return  TCL_ERROR  and leave an error message in the object
       result of interp.  Currently both cmdName and  hiddenCmdName  must  not
       contain	namespace  qualifiers,	or the operation will return TCL_ERROR
       and leave an error message in the object result of interp.  The CmdName
       will be looked up in the global namespace, and not relative to the cur-
       rent namespace, even if the current namespace is not  the  global  one.
       If  a  hidden  command  whose name is hiddenCmdName already exists, the
       operation also returns TCL_ERROR and the result field  in  interp  con-
       tains  an error message.  If the operation succeeds, it returns TCL_OK.
       After executing this command, attempts to use  cmdName  in  a  call  to
       Tcl_Eval or with the Tcl eval command will fail.
