NAME
       CPANPLUS::Backend::RV

SYNOPSIS
	   ### create a CPANPLUS::Backend::RV object
	   $backend_rv	   = CPANPLUS::Backend::RV->new(
				       ok	   => $boolean,
				       args	   => $args,
				       rv	   => $return_value
				       function    => $calling_function );

	   ### if you have a CPANPLUS::Backend::RV object
	   $passed_args    = $backend_rv->args;    # args passed to function
	   $ok		   = $backend_rv->ok;	   # boolean indication overall
						   # result of the call
	   $function	   = $backend_rv->fucntion # name of the calling
						   # function
	   $rv		   = $backend_rv->rv	   # the actual return value
						   # of the calling function

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides return value objects for multi-module calls to
       CPANPLUS::Backend. In boolean context, it returns the status of the
       overall result (ie, the same as the "ok" method would).

METHODS
   new( ok => BOOL, args => DATA, rv => DATA, [function => $method_name] )
       Creates a new CPANPLUS::Backend::RV object from the data provided.
       This method should only be called by CPANPLUS::Backend functions.  The
       accessors may be used by users inspecting an RV object.

       All the argument names can be used as accessors later to retrieve the
       data.

       Arguments:

       ok  Boolean indicating overall success

       args
	   The arguments provided to the function that returned this rv
	   object.  Useful to inspect later to see what was actually passed to
	   the function in case of an error.

       rv  An arbitrary data structure that has the detailed return values of
	   each of your multi-module calls.

       function
	   The name of the function that created this rv object.  Can be
	   explicitly passed. If not, "new()" will try to deduce the name from
	   "caller()" information.
