NAME
       Config::Extensions - hash lookup of which core extensions were built.

SYNOPSIS
	   use Config::Extensions '%Extensions';
	   if ($Extensions{PerlIO::via}) {
	       # This perl has PerlIO::via built
	   }

DESCRIPTION
       The Config::Extensions module provides a hash %Extensions containing
       all the core extensions that were enabled for this perl. The hash is
       keyed by extension name, with each entry having one of 3 possible
       values:

       dynamic
	   The extension is dynamically linked

       nonxs
	   The extension is pure perl, so doesn't need linking to the perl
	   executable

       static
	   The extension is statically linked to the perl binary

       As all values evaluate to true, a simple "if" test is good enough to
       determine whether an extension is present.

       All the data uses to generate the %Extensions hash is already present
       in the "Config" module, but not in such a convenient format to quickly
       reference.
