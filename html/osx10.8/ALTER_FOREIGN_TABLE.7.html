ALTER FOREIGN TABLE(7)	PostgreSQL 9.1.4 Documentation	ALTER FOREIGN TABLE(7)



NAME
       ALTER_FOREIGN_TABLE - change the definition of a foreign table

SYNOPSIS
       ALTER FOREIGN TABLE name
	   action [, ... ]
       ALTER FOREIGN TABLE name
	   RENAME [ COLUMN ] column TO new_column
       ALTER FOREIGN TABLE name
	   RENAME TO new_name
       ALTER FOREIGN TABLE name
	   SET SCHEMA new_schema

       where action is one of:

	   ADD [ COLUMN ] column type [ NULL | NOT NULL ]
	   DROP [ COLUMN ] [ IF EXISTS ] column [ RESTRICT | CASCADE ]
	   ALTER [ COLUMN ] column [ SET DATA ] TYPE type
	   ALTER [ COLUMN ] column { SET | DROP } NOT NULL
	   OWNER TO new_owner
	   OPTIONS ( [ ADD | SET | DROP ] option ['value'] [, ... ])

DESCRIPTION
       ALTER FOREIGN TABLE changes the definition of an existing foreign
       table. There are several subforms:

       ADD COLUMN
	   This form adds a new column to the foreign table, using the same
	   syntax as CREATE FOREIGN TABLE (CREATE_FOREIGN_TABLE(7)).

       DROP COLUMN [ IF EXISTS ]
	   This form drops a column from a foreign table. You will need to say
	   CASCADE if anything outside the table depends on the column; for
	   example, views. If IF EXISTS is specified and the column does not
	   exist, no error is thrown. In this case a notice is issued instead.

       SET DATA TYPE
	   This form changes the type of a column of a foreign table.

       SET/DROP NOT NULL
	   Mark a column as allowing, or not allowing, null values.

       OWNER
	   This form changes the owner of the foreign table to the specified
	   user.

       RENAME
	   The RENAME forms change the name of a foreign table or the name of
	   an individual column in a foreign table.

       SET SCHEMA
	   This form moves the foreign table into another schema.

       OPTIONS ( [ ADD | SET | DROP ] option ['value'] [, ... ] )
	   Change options for the foreign table.  ADD, SET, and DROP specify
	   the action to be performed.	ADD is assumed if no operation is
	   explicitly specified. Option names must be unique; names and values
	   are also validated using the foreign data wrapper library.

       All the actions except RENAME and SET SCHEMA can be combined into a
       list of multiple alterations to apply in parallel. For example, it is
       possible to add several columns and/or alter the type of several
       columns in a single command.

       You must own the table to use ALTER FOREIGN TABLE. To change the schema
       of a foreign table, you must also have CREATE privilege on the new
       schema. To alter the owner, you must also be a direct or indirect
       member of the new owning role, and that role must have CREATE privilege
       on the table's schema. (These restrictions enforce that altering the
       owner doesn't do anything you couldn't do by dropping and recreating
       the table. However, a superuser can alter ownership of any table
       anyway.)

PARAMETERS
       name
	   The name (possibly schema-qualified) of an existing foreign table
	   to alter.

       column
	   Name of a new or existing column.

       new_column
	   New name for an existing column.

       new_name
	   New name for the table.

       type
	   Data type of the new column, or new data type for an existing
	   column.

       CASCADE
	   Automatically drop objects that depend on the dropped column (for
	   example, views referencing the column).

       RESTRICT
	   Refuse to drop the column if there are any dependent objects. This
	   is the default behavior.

       new_owner
	   The user name of the new owner of the table.

       new_schema
	   The name of the schema to which the table will be moved.

NOTES
       The key word COLUMN is noise and can be omitted.

       Consistency with the foreign server is not checked when a column is
       added or removed with ADD COLUMN or DROP COLUMN, a NOT NULL constraint
       is added, or a column type is changed with SET DATA TYPE. It is the
       user's responsibility to ensure that the table definition matches the
       remote side.

       Refer to CREATE FOREIGN TABLE (CREATE_FOREIGN_TABLE(7)) for a further
       description of valid parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To mark a column as not-null:

	   ALTER FOREIGN TABLE distributors ALTER COLUMN street SET NOT NULL;

       To change options of a foreign table:

	   ALTER FOREIGN TABLE myschema.distributors OPTIONS (ADD opt1 'value', SET opt2, 'value2', DROP opt3 'value3');

COMPATIBILITY
       The forms ADD, DROP, and SET DATA TYPE conform with the SQL standard.
       The other forms are PostgreSQL extensions of the SQL standard. Also,
       the ability to specify more than one manipulation in a single ALTER
       FOREIGN TABLE command is an extension.


       ALTER FOREIGN TABLE DROP COLUMN can be used to drop the only column of
       a foreign table, leaving a zero-column table. This is an extension of
       SQL, which disallows zero-column foreign tables.
