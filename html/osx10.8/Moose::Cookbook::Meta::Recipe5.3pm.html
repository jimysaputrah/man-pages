NAME
       Moose::Cookbook::Meta::Recipe5 - The "table" attribute as a metaclass
       trait

VERSION
       version 2.0205

SYNOPSIS
	 package MyApp::Meta::Class::Trait::HasTable;
	 use Moose::Role;

	 has table => (
	     is  => 'rw',
	     isa => 'Str',
	 );

	 package Moose::Meta::Class::Custom::Trait::HasTable;
	 sub register_implementation { 'MyApp::Meta::Class::Trait::HasTable' }

	 package MyApp::User;
	 use Moose -traits => 'HasTable';

	 __PACKAGE__->meta->table('User');

DESCRIPTION
       This recipe takes the metaclass table attribute from
       Moose::Cookbook::Meta::Recipe4 and implements it as a metaclass trait.
       Traits are just roles, as we saw in Moose::Cookbook::Meta::Recipe3.

       The advantage of using traits is that it's easy to combine multiple
       traits, whereas combining multiple metaclass subclasses requires
       creating yet another subclass. With traits, Moose takes care of
       applying them to your metaclass.

   Using this Metaclass Trait in Practice
       Once this trait has been applied to a metaclass, it looks exactly like
       the example we saw in Moose::Cookbook::Meta::Recipe4:

	 my $table = MyApp::User->meta->table;

	 # the safe version
	 $table = MyApp::User->meta->table
	     if MyApp::User->meta->meta->can('does')
		and MyApp::User->meta->meta->does('MyApp::Meta::Class');

       The safe version is a little complicated. We have to check that the
       metaclass object's metaclass has a "does" method, in which case we can
       ask if the the metaclass does a given role.

       It's simpler to just write:

	 $table = MyApp::User->meta->table
	     if MyApp::User->meta->can('table');

       In theory, this is a little less correct, since the metaclass might be
       getting its "table" method from a different role. In practice, you are
       unlikely to encounter this sort of problem.
