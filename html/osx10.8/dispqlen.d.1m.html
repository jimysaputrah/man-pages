NAME
       dispqlen.d - dispatcher queue length by CPU. Uses DTrace.

SYNOPSIS
       dispqlen.d

DESCRIPTION
       The  dispatcher queue length is an indication of CPU saturation.  It is
       not an indicatior of utilisation - the CPUs may or may not be  utilised
       when the dispatcher queue reports a length of zero.

       This script measures this activity by sampling at 1000 Hertz per CPU.

       Since  this  uses  DTrace, only users with root privileges can run this
       command.

EXAMPLES
       Print dispatcher queue length by CPU.
	      # dispqlen.d


DOCUMENTATION
       See the DTraceToolkit for further documentation under the  Docs	direc-
       tory. The DTraceToolkit docs may include full worked examples with ver-
       bose descriptions explaining the output.

EXIT
       dispqlen.d will sample until Ctrl-C is hit.
