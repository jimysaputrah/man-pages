NAME
     tnftpd -- Internet File Transfer Protocol server

SYNOPSIS
     tnftpd [-46DdHkKlnQqrsUuWwXzZ] [-a anondir] [-C user[@host]] [-c confdir]
	    [-e emailaddr] [-h hostname] [-L xferlogfile] [-P dataport]
	    [-V version]

DESCRIPTION
     tnftpd is the Internet File Transfer Protocol server process.  The server
     uses the TCP protocol and listens at the port specified in the ``ftp''
     service specification; see services(5).

     Available options:

     -4      When -D is specified, bind to IPv4 addresses only.

     -6      When -D is specified, bind to IPv6 addresses only.

     -a anondir
	     Define anondir as the directory to chroot(2) into for anonymous
	     logins.  Default is the home directory for the ftp user.  This
	     can also be specified with the ftpd.conf(5) chroot directive.

     -C user[@host]
	     Check whether user (as if connecting from host, if provided)
	     would be granted access under the restrictions given in
	     ftpusers(5), and exit without attempting a connection.  tnftpd
	     exits with an exit code of 0 if access would be granted, or 1
	     otherwise.  This can be useful for testing configurations.

     -c confdir
	     Change the root directory of the configuration files from
	     ``/private/etc'' to confdir.  This changes the directory for the
	     following files: /private/etc/ftpchroot, /private/etc/ftpusers,
	     /private/etc/ftpwelcome, /private/etc/motd, and the file speci-
	     fied by the ftpd.conf(5) limit directive.

     -D      Run as daemon.  tnftpd will listen on the default FTP port for
	     incoming connections and fork a child for each connection.  This
	     is lower overhead than starting tnftpd from inetd(8) and thus
	     might be useful on busy servers to reduce load.

     -d      Debugging information is written to the syslog using a facility
	     of LOG_FTP.

     -e emailaddr
	     Use emailaddr for the ``%E'' escape sequence (see Display file
	     escape sequences)

     -H      Equivalent to ``-h `hostname`''.

     -h hostname
	     Explicitly set the hostname to advertise as to hostname.  The
	     default is the hostname associated with the IP address that
	     tnftpd is listening on.  This ability (with or without -h), in
	     conjunction with -c confdir, is useful when configuring `virtual'
	     FTP servers, each listening on separate addresses as separate
	     names.  Refer to inetd.conf(5) for more information on starting
	     services to listen on specific IP addresses.

     -k      Allow use of the CCC command.

     -K      Require authenticated credentials.

     -L xferlogfile
	     Log wu-ftpd style `xferlog' entries to xferlogfile.

     -l      Each successful and failed FTP session is logged using syslog
	     with a facility of LOG_FTP.  If this option is specified more
	     than once, the retrieve (get), store (put), append, delete, make
	     directory, remove directory and rename operations and their file
	     name arguments are also logged.

     -n      Don't attempt translation of IP addresses to hostnames.

     -P dataport
	     Use dataport as the data port, overriding the default of using
	     the port one less that the port tnftpd is listening on.

     -Q      Disable the use of pid files for keeping track of the number of
	     logged-in users per class.  This may reduce the load on heavily
	     loaded FTP servers.

     -q      Enable the use of pid files for keeping track of the number of
	     logged-in users per class.  This is the default.

     -r      Permanently drop root privileges once the user is logged in.  The
	     use of this option may result in the server using a port other
	     than the (listening-port - 1) for PORT style commands, which is
	     contrary to the RFC 959 specification, but in practice very few
	     clients rely upon this behaviour.	See SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
	     below for more details.

     -s      Require a secure authentication mechanism like Kerberos or S/Key
	     to be used.

     -U      Don't log each concurrent FTP session to /var/run/utmp.  This is
	     the default.

     -u      Log each concurrent FTP session to /var/run/utmp, making them
	     visible to commands such as who(1).

     -V version
	     Use version as the version to advertise in the login banner and
	     in the output of STAT and SYST instead of the default version
	     information.  If version is empty or `-' then don't display any
	     version information.

     -W      Don't log each FTP session to /var/log/wtmp.

     -w      Log each FTP session to /var/log/wtmp, making them visible to
	     commands such as last(1).	This is the default.

     -X      Log wu-ftpd style `xferlog' entries to the syslog, prefixed with
	     ``xferlog: '', using a facility of LOG_FTP.  These syslog entries
	     can be converted to a wu-ftpd style xferlog file suitable for
	     input into a third-party log analysis tool with a command similar
	     to:
		   sed -ne 's/^.*xferlog: //p' /var/log/xferlog > wuxferlog

     -z      Require authorization.

     -Z      Require authentication.

     The file /etc/nologin can be used to disable FTP access.  If the file
     exists, tnftpd displays it and exits.  If the file
     /private/etc/ftpwelcome exists, tnftpd prints it before issuing the
     ``ready'' message.  If the file /private/etc/motd exists (under the
     chroot directory if applicable), tnftpd prints it after a successful
     login.  This may be changed with the ftpd.conf(5) directive motd.

     The tnftpd server currently supports the following FTP requests.  The
     case of the requests is ignored.

     The following FTP requests (as specified in RFC 959 and RFC 2228) are
     recognized, but are not implemented: ACCT, ADAT, AUTH, CCC, CONF, ENC,
     MIC, PBSZ, PROT, REIN, and SMNT.

     The tnftpd server will abort an active file transfer only when the ABOR
     command is preceded by a Telnet "Interrupt Process" (IP) signal and a
     Telnet "Synch" signal in the command Telnet stream, as described in
     Internet RFC 959.	If a STAT command is received during a data transfer,
     preceded by a Telnet IP and Synch, transfer status will be returned.

     tnftpd interprets file names according to the ``globbing'' conventions
     used by csh(1).  This allows users to use the metacharacters ``*?[]{}~''.

   User authentication
     tnftpd authenticates users according to five rules.

	   1.	The login name must be in the password data base, passwd(5),
		and not have a null password.  In this case a password must be
		provided by the client before any file operations may be per-
		formed.  If the user has an S/Key key, the response from a
		successful USER command will include an S/Key challenge.  The
		client may choose to respond with a PASS command giving either
		a standard password or an S/Key one-time password.  The server
		will automatically determine which type of password it has
		been given and attempt to authenticate accordingly.  See
		skey(1) for more information on S/Key authentication.  S/Key
		is a Trademark of Bellcore.

	   2.	The login name must be allowed based on the information in
		ftpusers(5).

	   3.	The user must have a standard shell returned by
		getusershell(3).  If the user's shell field in the password
		database is empty, the shell is assumed to be /bin/sh.	As per
		shells(5), the user's shell must be listed with full path in
		/etc/shells.

	   4.	If directed by the file ftpchroot(5) the session's root direc-
		tory will be changed by chroot(2) to the directory specified
		in the ftpd.conf(5) chroot directive (if set), or to the home
		directory of the user.	This facility may also be triggered by
		enabling the boolean ftp-chroot in login.conf(5).  However,
		the user must still supply a password.	This feature is
		intended as a compromise between a fully anonymous account and
		a fully privileged account.  The account should also be set up
		as for an anonymous account.

	   5.	If the user name is ``anonymous'' or ``ftp'', an anonymous FTP
		account must be present in the password file (user ``ftp'').
		In this case the user is allowed to log in by specifying any
		password (by convention an email address for the user should
		be used as the password).

		The server performs a chroot(2) to the directory specified in
		the ftpd.conf(5) chroot directive (if set), the -a anondir
		directory (if set), or to the home directory of the ``ftp''
		user.

		The server then performs a chdir(2) to the directory specified
		in the ftpd.conf(5) homedir directive (if set), otherwise to
		/.

		If other restrictions are required (such as disabling of cer-
		tain commands and the setting of a specific umask), then
		appropriate entries in ftpd.conf(5) are required.

		If the first character of the password supplied by an anony-
		mous user is ``-'', then the verbose messages displayed at
		login and upon a CWD command are suppressed.

   Display file escape sequences
     When tnftpd displays various files back to the client (such as
     /private/etc/ftpwelcome and /private/etc/motd), various escape strings
     are replaced with information pertinent to the current connection.

     The supported escape strings are:
	   Escape  Description
	   %c	   Class name.
	   %C	   Current working directory.
	   %E	   Email address given with -e.
	   %L	   Local hostname.
	   %M	   Maximum number of users for this class.  Displays
		   ``unlimited'' if there's no limit.
	   %N	   Current number of users for this class.
	   %R	   Remote hostname.
	   %s	   If the result of the most recent ``%M'' or ``%N'' was not
		   ``1'', print an ``s''.
	   %S	   If the result of the most recent ``%M'' or ``%N'' was not
		   ``1'', print an ``S''.
	   %T	   Current time.
	   %U	   User name.
	   %%	   A ``%'' character.

   Setting up a restricted ftp subtree
     In order that system security is not breached, it is recommended that the
     subtrees for the ``ftp'' and ``chroot'' accounts be constructed with
     care, following these rules (replace ``ftp'' in the following directory
     names with the appropriate account name for `chroot' users):

	   ~ftp 	  Make the home directory owned by ``root'' and
			  unwritable by anyone.

	   ~ftp/bin	  Make this directory owned by ``root'' and unwritable
			  by anyone (mode 555).  Generally any conversion com-
			  mands should be installed here (mode 111).

	   ~ftp/etc	  Make this directory owned by ``root'' and unwritable
			  by anyone (mode 555).  The files pwd.db (see
			  passwd(5)) and group (see group(5)) must be present
			  for the LIST command to be able to display owner and
			  group names instead of numbers.  The password field
			  in passwd(5) is not used, and should not contain
			  real passwords.  The file motd, if present, will be
			  printed after a successful login.  These files
			  should be mode 444.

	   ~ftp/pub	  This directory and the subdirectories beneath it
			  should be owned by the users and groups responsible
			  for placing files in them, and be writable only by
			  them (mode 755 or 775).  They should not be owned or
			  writable by ftp or its group.

	   ~ftp/incoming  This directory is where anonymous users place files
			  they upload.	The owners should be the user ``ftp''
			  and an appropriate group.  Members of this group
			  will be the only users with access to these files
			  after they have been uploaded; these should be peo-
			  ple who know how to deal with them appropriately.
			  If you wish anonymous FTP users to be able to see
			  the names of the files in this directory the permis-
			  sions should be 770, otherwise they should be 370.

			  The following ftpd.conf(5) directives should be
			  used:
				modify guest off
				umask  guest 0707
				upload guest on

			  This will result in anonymous users being able to
			  upload files to this directory, but they will not be
			  able to download them, delete them, or overwrite
			  them, due to the umask and disabling of the commands
			  mentioned above.

	   ~ftp/tmp	  This directory is used to create temporary files
			  which contain the error messages generated by a con-
			  version or LIST command.  The owner should be the
			  user ``ftp''.  The permissions should be 300.

			  If you don't enable conversion commands, or don't
			  want anonymous users uploading files here (see
			  ~ftp/incoming above), then don't create this direc-
			  tory.  However, error messages from conversion or
			  LIST commands won't be returned to the user.	(This
			  is the traditional behaviour.)  Note that the
			  ftpd.conf(5) directive upload can be used to prevent
			  users uploading here.

     To set up "ftp-only" accounts that provide only FTP, but no valid shell
     login, you can copy/link /sbin/nologin to /sbin/ftplogin, and enter
     /sbin/ftplogin to /etc/shells to allow logging-in via FTP into the
     accounts, which must have /sbin/ftplogin as login shell.

FILES
     /private/etc/ftpchroot   List of normal users whose root directory should
			      be changed via chroot(2).
     /private/etc/ftpd.conf   Configure file conversions and other settings.
     /private/etc/ftpusers    List of unwelcome/restricted users.
     /private/etc/ftpwelcome  Welcome notice before login.
     /private/etc/motd	      Welcome notice after login.
     /etc/nologin	      If it exists, displayed and access is refused.
     /var/run/ftpd.pids-CLASS
			      State file of logged-in processes for the tnftpd
			      class `CLASS'.
     /var/run/utmp	      List of logged-in users on the system.
     /var/log/wtmp	      Login history database.

STANDARDS
     tnftpd recognizes all commands in RFC 959, follows the guidelines in RFC
     1123, recognizes all commands in RFC 2228 (although they are not sup-
     ported yet), and supports the extensions from RFC 2389, RFC 2428, and RFC
     3659.

HISTORY
     The tnftpd command appeared in 4.2BSD.

     Various features such as the ftpd.conf(5) functionality, RFC 2389, and
     RFC 3659 support was implemented in NetBSD 1.3 and later releases by Luke
     Mewburn.

BUGS
     The server must run as the super-user to create sockets with privileged
     port numbers (i.e, those less than IPPORT_RESERVED, which is 1024).  If
     tnftpd is listening on a privileged port it maintains an effective user
     id of the logged in user, reverting to the super-user only when binding
     addresses to privileged sockets.  The -r option can be used to override
     this behaviour and force privileges to be permanently revoked; see
     SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS below for more details.

     tnftpd may have trouble handling connections from scoped IPv6 addresses,
     or IPv4 mapped addresses (IPv4 connection on AF_INET6 socket).  For the
     latter case, running two daemons, one for IPv4 and one for IPv6, will
     avoid the problem.

SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
     RFC 959 provides no restrictions on the PORT command, and this can lead
     to security problems, as tnftpd can be fooled into connecting to any ser-
     vice on any host.	With the ``checkportcmd'' feature of the ftpd.conf(5),
     PORT commands with different host addresses, or TCP ports lower than
     IPPORT_RESERVED will be rejected.	This also prevents `third-party proxy
     ftp' from working.  Use of this option is strongly recommended, and
     enabled by default.

     By default tnftpd uses a port that is one less than the port it is lis-
     tening on to communicate back to the client for the EPRT, LPRT, and PORT
     commands, unless overridden with -P dataport.  As the default port for
     tnftpd (21) is a privileged port below IPPORT_RESERVED, tnftpd retains
     the ability to switch back to root privileges to bind these ports.  In
     order to increase security by reducing the potential for a bug in tnftpd
     providing a remote root compromise, tnftpd will permanently drop root
     privileges if one of the following is true:

	   1.	tnftpd is running on a port greater than IPPORT_RESERVED and
		the user has logged in as a `guest' or `chroot' user.

	   2.	tnftpd was invoked with -r.

     Don't create ~ftp/tmp if you don't want anonymous users to upload files
     there.  That directory is only necessary if you want to display the error
     messages of conversion commands to the user.  Note that if uploads are
     disabled with the ftpd.conf(5) directive upload, then this directory can-
     not be abused by the user in this way, so it should be safe to create.

     To avoid possible denial-of-service attacks, SIZE requests against files
     larger than 10240 bytes will be denied if the current transfer TYPE is
     `A' (ASCII).
