NAME
       Log::Message::Config - Configuration options for Log::Message

SYNOPSIS
	   # This module is implicitly used by Log::Message to create a config
	   # which it uses to log messages.
	   # For the options you can pass, see the C&ltLog::Message new()&gt method.

	   # Below is a sample of a config file you could use

	   # comments are denoted by a single '#'
	   # use a shared stack, or have a private instance?
	   # if none provided, set to '0',
	   private = 1

	   # do not be verbose
	   verbose = 0

	   # default tag to set on new items
	   # if none provided, set to 'NONE'
	   tag = SOME TAG

	   # default level to handle items
	   # if none provided, set to 'log'
	   level = carp

	   # extra files to include
	   # if none provided, no files are auto included
	   include = mylib.pl
	   include = ../my/other/lib.pl

	   # automatically delete items
	   # when you retrieve them from the stack?
	   # if none provided, set to '0'
	   remove = 1

	   # retrieve errors in chronological order, or not?
	   # if none provided, set to '1'
	   chrono = 0

DESCRIPTION
       Log::Message::Config provides a standardized config object for
       Log::Message objects.

       It can either read options as perl arguments, or as a config file.  See
       the Log::Message manpage for more information about what arguments are
       valid, and see the Synopsis for an example config file you can use
