NAME
       glutMouseFunc - sets the mouse callback for the current window.

SYNTAX
       #include &ltGLUT/glut.h&gt

       void glutMouseFunc(void (*func)(int button, int state,
			  int x, int y));

ARGUMENTS
       func	 The new mouse callback function.

DESCRIPTION
       glutMouseFunc  sets  the  mouse callback for the current window. When a
       user presses and releases mouse buttons in the window, each  press  and
       each release generates a mouse callback. The button parameter is one of
       GLUT_LEFT_BUTTON, GLUT_MIDDLE_BUTTON, or GLUT_RIGHT_BUTTON. For systems
       with  only  two	mouse  buttons,  it  may  not  be possible to generate
       GLUT_MIDDLE_BUTTON callback. For systems with a single mouse button, it
       may be possible to generate only a GLUT_LEFT_BUTTON callback. The state
       parameter is either GLUT_UP or GLUT_DOWN indicating whether  the  call-
       back  was  due to a release or press respectively. The x and y callback
       parameters indicate the window relative coordinates when the mouse but-
       ton  state  changed.  If  a GLUT_DOWN callback for a specific button is
       triggered, the program can assume a GLUT_UP callback for the same  but-
       ton  will  be generated (assuming the window still has a mouse callback
       registered) when the mouse button is released even  if  the  mouse  has
       moved outside the window.

       If  a  menu  is attached to a button for a window, mouse callbacks will
       not be generated for that button.

       During a mouse callback, glutGetModifiers may be  called  to  determine
       the state of modifier keys when the mouse event generating the callback
       occurred.

       Passing NULL to glutMouseFunc disables the generation  of  mouse  call-
       backs.
