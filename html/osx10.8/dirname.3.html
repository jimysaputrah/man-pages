DIRNAME(3)		 BSD Library Functions Manual		    DIRNAME(3)

NAME
     dirname -- extract the directory part of a pathname

SYNOPSIS
     #include &ltlibgen.h&gt

     char *
     dirname(char *path);

DESCRIPTION
     The dirname() function is the converse of basename(3); it returns a
     pointer to the parent directory of the pathname pointed to by path.  Any
     trailing `/' characters are not counted as part of the directory name.
     If path is a null pointer, the empty string, or contains no `/' charac-
     ters, dirname() returns a pointer to the string ".", signifying the cur-
     rent directory.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
     The dirname() function returns a pointer to internal storage space allo-
     cated on the first call that will be overwritten by subsequent calls.

     Other vendor implementations of dirname() may modify the contents of the
     string passed to dirname(); if portability is desired, this should be
     taken into account when writing code which calls this function.

LEGACY SYNOPSIS
     #include &ltlibgen.h&gt

     char *
     dirname(const char *path);

     In legacy mode, path will not be changed.

RETURN VALUES
     On successful completion, dirname() returns a pointer to the parent
     directory of path.

     If dirname() fails, a null pointer is returned and the global variable
     errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
     The following error codes may be set in errno:

     [ENAMETOOLONG]	The path component to be returned was larger than
			MAXPATHLEN.

SEE ALSO
     basename(1), dirname(1), basename(3), compat(5)

STANDARDS
     The dirname() function conforms to X/Open Portability Guide Issue 4,
     Version 2 (``XPG4.2'').

HISTORY
     The dirname() function first appeared in OpenBSD 2.2 and FreeBSD 4.2.
