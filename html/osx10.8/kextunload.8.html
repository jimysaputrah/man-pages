KEXTUNLOAD(8)		  BSD System Manager's Manual		 KEXTUNLOAD(8)

NAME
     kextunload -- terminate driver I/O Kit driver instances and unload kernel
     extensions (kexts)

SYNOPSIS
     kextunload [options] [--] [kext ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The kextunload program is used to terminate and unregister I/O Kit
     objects associated with a kernel extension (kext) and to unload the code
     and personalities for that kext.  kextunload must run with superuser
     privileges.

     If another loaded kext has a dependency on the kext being unloaded, the
     unload will fail.	You can determine whether a kext has dependents using
     the kextstat(8) tool.

     kextunload is a formal interface for unloading kexts in the Darwin OS and
     in Mac OS X.  Software and installers can rely on its presence and invoke
     it in order to unload kexts.  Note that long options are present as of
     Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard).

     The arguments and options are:

     kext     Unload the loaded kext whose bundle identifier matches the
	      CFBundleIdentifier of kext.  All instances of IOService sub-
	      classes defined by the loaded kext and in the IOService plane of
	      the I/O Registry are terminated; the kext is checked to make
	      sure no instances of its libkern C++ classes remain; the kext's
	      C++ static destructores and module stop routine are invoked;
	      then the kext's executable and IOKitPersonalities are unloaded
	      from the kernel.	Failure at any stage prevents kext unload.

     -b identifier, -bundle-id identifier
	      Unload executable and IOKitPersonalities (as described immedi-
	      ately above) for the kext whose CFBundleIdentifier is
	      identifier.

     -c classname, -class classname
	      Terminate all instances of class classname that are in the
	      IOService plane of the I/O Registry, if possible, but do not
	      unload the defining kext or its IOKitPersonalities.  New load
	      requests for devices that were driven by these terminated
	      instances may result in the same class being instantiated at any
	      time.

     -h, -help
	      Print a help message describing each option flag and exit with a
	      success result, regardless of any other options on the command
	      line.

     -m identifier
	      Same as -b (remains for backward compatibility).

     -p, -personalities-only
	      Terminate services and remove personalities only; do not unload
	      kexts.

     -q, -quiet
	      Quiet mode; print no informational or error messages.

     -v [0-6 | 0x####], -verbose [0-6 | 0x####]
	      Verbose mode; print information about program operation.	Higher
	      levels of verbosity include all lower levels.  By default
	      kextunload prints only warnings and errors.  You can specify a
	      level from 0-6, or a hexadecimal log specification (as described
	      in kext_logging(8)). The levels of verbose output are:

	      0 	   Print only errors (that is, suppress warnings); see
			   also -quiet.

	      1 (or none)  Print basic information about program operation.

	      2 	   Prints information about unload stages.

	      3 	   Prints information about removal of personalities.

	      4 	   Prints information about module stop functions and
			   C++ class destruction.

	      5 	   Prints detailed information internal operations
			   such as bookkeping.

	      6 	   Identical to level 5 for kextunload.

	      Unlike in other kext tools, the -verbose flag in kextunload
	      applies to all kexts (that is, it turns on hexadecimal bit 0x8
	      by default).  See kext_logging(8) for more information on ver-
	      bose logging.

DIAGNOSTICS
     kextunload exits with a zero status upon success, or prints an error mes-
     sage and exits with a nonzero status upon failure.

BUGS
     Many single-letter options are inconsistent in meaning with (or directly
     contradictory to) the same letter options in other kext tools.
