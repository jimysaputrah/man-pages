NAME
       PKCS12_parse - parse a PKCS#12 structure

SYNOPSIS
	#include <openssl/pkcs12.h>

       int PKCS12_parse(PKCS12 *p12, const char *pass, EVP_PKEY **pkey, X509
       **cert, STACK_OF(X509) **ca);

DESCRIPTION
       PKCS12_parse() parses a PKCS12 structure.

       p12 is the PKCS12 structure to parse. pass is the passphrase to use.
       If successful the private key will be written to *pkey, the
       corresponding certificate to *cert and any additional certificates to
       *ca.

NOTES
       The parameters pkey and cert cannot be NULL. ca can be <NULL> in which
       case additional certificates will be discarded. *ca can also be a valid
       STACK in which case additional certificates are appended to *ca. If *ca
       is NULL a new STACK will be allocated.

       The friendlyName and localKeyID attributes (if present) on each
       certificate will be stored in the alias and keyid attributes of the
       X509 structure.

RETURN VALUES
       PKCS12_parse() returns 1 for success and zero if an error occurred.

       The error can be obtained from ERR_get_error(3)

BUGS
       Only a single private key and corresponding certificate is returned by
       this function. More complex PKCS#12 files with multiple private keys
       will only return the first match.

       Only friendlyName and localKeyID attributes are currently stored in
       certificates. Other attributes are discarded.

       Attributes currently cannot be stored in the private key EVP_PKEY
       structure.
