Encode::Encoder(3pm)   Perl Programmers Reference Guide   Encode::Encoder(3pm)



NAME
       Encode::Encoder -- Object Oriented Encoder

SYNOPSIS
	 use Encode::Encoder;
	 # Encode::encode("ISO-8859-1", $data);
	 Encode::Encoder-&gtnew($data)-&gtiso_8859_1; # OOP way
	 # shortcut
	 use Encode::Encoder qw(encoder);
	 encoder($data)-&gtiso_8859_1;
	 # you can stack them!
	 encoder($data)-&gtiso_8859_1-&gtbase64;  # provided base64() is defined
	 # you can use it as a decoder as well
	 encoder($base64)-&gtbytes('base64')-&gtlatin1;
	 # stringified
	 print encoder($data)-&gtutf8-&gtlatin1;  # prints the string in latin1
	 # numified
	 encoder("\x{abcd}\x{ef}g")-&gtutf8 == 6; # true. bytes::length($data)

ABSTRACT
       Encode::Encoder allows you to use Encode in an object-oriented style.
       This is not only more intuitive than a functional approach, but also
       handier when you want to stack encodings.  Suppose you want your UTF-8
       string converted to Latin1 then Base64: you can simply say

	 my $base64 = encoder($utf8)-&gtlatin1-&gtbase64;

       instead of

	 my $latin1 = encode("latin1", $utf8);
	 my $base64 = encode_base64($utf8);

       or the lazier and more convoluted

	 my $base64 = encode_base64(encode("latin1", $utf8));

Description
       Here is how to use this module.

       o   There are at least two instance variables stored in a hash
	   reference, {data} and {encoding}.

       o   When there is no method, it takes the method name as the name of
	   the encoding and encodes the instance data with encoding.  If
	   successful, the instance encoding is set accordingly.

       o   You can retrieve the result via -&gtdata but usually you don't have
	   to because the stringify operator ("") is overridden to do exactly
	   that.

   Predefined Methods
       This module predefines the methods below:

       $e = Encode::Encoder-&gtnew([$data, $encoding]);
	   returns an encoder object.  Its data is initialized with $data if
	   present, and its encoding is set to $encoding if present.

	   When $encoding is omitted, it defaults to utf8 if $data is already
	   in utf8 or "" (empty string) otherwise.

       encoder()
	   is an alias of Encode::Encoder-&gtnew().  This one is exported on
	   demand.

       $e-&gtdata([$data])
	   When $data is present, sets the instance data to $data and returns
	   the object itself.  Otherwise, the current instance data is
	   returned.

       $e-&gtencoding([$encoding])
	   When $encoding is present, sets the instance encoding to $encoding
	   and returns the object itself.  Otherwise, the current instance
	   encoding is returned.

       $e-&gtbytes([$encoding])
	   decodes instance data from $encoding, or the instance encoding if
	   omitted.  If the conversion is successful, the instance encoding
	   will be set to "".

	   The name bytes was deliberately picked to avoid namespace tainting
	   -- this module may be used as a base class so method names that
	   appear in Encode::Encoding are avoided.

   Example: base64 transcoder
       This module is designed to work with Encode::Encoding.  To make the
       Base64 transcoder example above really work, you could write a module
       like this:

	 package Encode::Base64;
	 use base 'Encode::Encoding';
	 __PACKAGE__-&gtDefine('base64');
	 use MIME::Base64;
	 sub encode{
	     my ($obj, $data) = @_;
	     return encode_base64($data);
	 }
	 sub decode{
	     my ($obj, $data) = @_;
	     return decode_base64($data);
	 }
	 1;
	 __END__

       And your caller module would be something like this:

	 use Encode::Encoder;
	 use Encode::Base64;

	 # now you can really do the following

	 encoder($data)-&gtiso_8859_1-&gtbase64;
	 encoder($base64)-&gtbytes('base64')-&gtlatin1;

   Operator Overloading
       This module overloads two operators, stringify ("") and numify (0+).

       Stringify dumps the data inside the object.

       Numify returns the number of bytes in the instance data.

       They come in handy when you want to print or find the size of data.
