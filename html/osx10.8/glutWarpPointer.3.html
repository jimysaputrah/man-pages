NAME
       glutWarpPointer warps the pointer's location.

SYNTAX
       #include <GLUT/glut.h>

       void glutWarpPointer(int x, int y);

ARGUMENTS
       x	 X  offset  relative  to  the  current	window's origin (upper
		 left).

       y	 Y offset relative  to	the  current  window's	origin	(upper
		 left).

DESCRIPTION
       glutWarpPointer	warps  the  window  system's pointer to a new location
       relative to the origin of the current window.  The new location will be
       offset x pixels on the X axis and y pixels on the Y axis.  These param-
       eters may be negative.  The warp is done immediately.

       If the pointer would  be  warped  outside  the  screen's  frame	buffer
       region,	the  location will be clamped to the nearest screen edge.  The
       window system is allowed to further constrain the pointer's location in
       window system dependent ways.

       The  following  is good advice that applies to glutWarpPointer: ``There
       is seldom any reason for calling this function. The pointer should nor-
       mally be left to the user.'' (from Xlib's XWarpPointer man page.)
