NAME
       Class::Autouse - Run-time load a class the first time you call a method
       in it.

SYNOPSIS
	 # Debugging (if you go that way) must be set before the first use
	 BEGIN {
	     $Class::Autouse::DEBUG = 1;
	 }

	 # Load a class on method call
	 use Class::Autouse;
	 Class::Autouse-&gtautouse( 'CGI' );
	 print CGI-&gtb('Wow!');

	 # Use as a pragma
	 use Class::Autouse qw{CGI};

	 # Turn on developer mode
	 use Class::Autouse qw{:devel};

	 # Turn on the Super Loader
	 use Class::Autouse qw{:superloader};

	 # Disable module-existance check, and thus one additional 'stat'
	 # per module, at autouse-time if loading modules off a remote
	 # network drive such as NFS or SMB.
	 use Class::Autouse qw{:nostat};

DESCRIPTION
       "Class::Autouse" allows you to specify a class the will only load when
       a method of that class is called. For large classes that might not be
       used during the running of a program, such as Date::Manip, this can
       save you large amounts of memory, and decrease the script load time a
       great deal.

   Class, not Module
       The terminology "class loading" instead of "module loading" is used
       intentionally. Modules will only be loaded if they are acting as a
       class.

       That is, they will only be loaded during a Class-&gtmethod call. If you
       try to use a subroutine directly, say with "Class::method()", the class
       will not be loaded and a fatal error will mostly likely occur.

       This limitation is made to allow more powerfull features in other
       areas, because the module can focus on just loading the modules, and
       not have to deal with importing.

       And really, if you are doing OO Perl, you should be avoiding importing
       wherever possible.

   Use as a pragma
       Class::Autouse can be used as a pragma, specifying a list of classes to
       load as the arguments. For example

	  use Class::Autouse qw{CGI Data::Manip This::That};

       is equivalent to

	  use Class::Autouse;
	  Class::Autouse-&gtautouse( 'CGI'	 );
	  Class::Autouse-&gtautouse( 'Data::Manip' );
	  Class::Autouse-&gtautouse( 'This::That'  );

   Developer Mode
       "Class::Autouse" features a developer mode. In developer mode, classes
       are loaded immediately, just like they would be with a normal 'use'
       statement (although the import sub isn't called).

       This allows error checking to be done while developing, at the expense
       of a larger memory overhead. Developer mode is turned on either with
       the "devel" method, or using :devel in any of the pragma arguments.
       For example, this would load CGI.pm immediately

	   use Class::Autouse qw{:devel CGI};

       While developer mode is roughly equivalent to just using a normal use
       command, for a large number of modules it lets you use autoloading
       notation, and just comment or uncomment a single line to turn developer
       mode on or off. You can leave it on during development, and turn it off
       for speed reasons when deploying.

   No-Stat Mode
       For situations where a module exists on a remote disk or another
       relatively expensive location, you can call "Class::Autouse" with the
       :nostat param to disable initial file existance checking at hook time.

	 # Disable autoload-time file existance checking
	 use Class::Autouse qw{:nostat};

   Super Loader Mode
       Turning on the "Class::Autouse" super loader allows you to
       automatically load ANY class without specifying it first. Thus, the
       following will work and is completely legal.

	   use Class::Autouse qw{:superloader};

	   print CGI-&gtb('Wow!');

       The super loader can be turned on with either the
       "Class::Autouse-&gt"superloader&gt method, or the ":superloader" pragma
       argument.

       Please note that unlike the normal one-at-a-time autoloading, the
       super-loader makes global changes, and so is not completely self-
       contained.

       It has the potential to cause unintended effects at a distance. If you
       encounter unusual behaviour, revert to autousing one-at-a-time, or use
       the recursive loading.

       Use of the Super Loader is highly discouraged for widely distributed
       public applications or modules unless unavoidable. Do not use just to
       be lazy and save a few lines of code.

   Recursive Loading
       As an alternative to the super loader, the "autouse_recursive" and
       "load_recursive" methods can be used to autouse or load an entire tree
       of classes.

       For example, the following would give you access to all the URI related
       classes installed on the machine.

	   Class::Autouse-&gtautouse_recursive( 'URI' );

       Please note that the loadings will only occur down a single branch of
       the include path, whichever the top class is located in.

   mod_perl
       The mechanism that "Class::Autouse" uses is not compatible with
       mod_perl.  In particular with reloader modules like Apache::Reload.
       "Class::Autouse" detects the presence of mod_perl and acts as normal,
       but will always load all classes immediately, equivalent to having
       developer mode enabled.

       This is actually beneficial, as under mod_perl classes should be
       preloaded in the parent mod_perl process anyway, to prevent them having
       to be loaded by the Apache child classes. It also saves HUGE amounts of
       memory.

   prefork
       As for mod_perl, "Class::Autouse" is compatible with the prefork
       module, and all modules autoloaded will be loaded before forking
       correctly, when requested by prefork.

   The Internal Debugger
       Class::Autouse provides an internal debugger, which can be used to
       debug any weird edge cases you might encounter when using it.

       If the $Class::Autouse::DEBUG variable is true when "Class::Autouse" is
       first loaded, debugging will be compiled in. This debugging prints
       output like the following to STDOUT.

	Class::Autouse::autouse_recursive( 'Foo' )
	 Class::Autouse::_recursive( 'Foo', 'load' )
	  Class::Autouse::load( 'Foo' )
	  Class::Autouse::_child_classes( 'Foo' )
	  Class::Autouse::load( 'Foo::Bar' )
	   Class::Autouse::_file_exists( 'Foo/Bar.pm' )
	   Class::Autouse::load -&gt Loading in Foo/Bar.pm
	  Class::Autouse::load( 'Foo::More' )
	   etc...

       Please note that because this is optimised out if not used, you can no
       longer (since 1.20) enable debugging at run-time. This decision was
       made to remove a large number of unneeded branching and speed up
       loading.

METHODS
   autouse $class, ...
       The autouse method sets one or more classes to be loaded as required.

   load $class
       The load method loads one or more classes into memory. This is
       functionally equivalent to using require to load the class list in,
       except that load will detect and remove the autoloading hook from a
       previously autoused class, whereas as use effectively ignore the class,
       and not load it.

   devel
       The devel method sets development mode on (argument of 1) or off
       (argument of 0).

       If any classes have previously been autouse'd and not loaded when this
       method is called, they will be loaded immediately.

   superloader
       The superloader method turns on the super loader.

       Please note that once you have turned the superloader on, it cannot be
       turned off. This is due to code that might be relying on it being there
       not being able to autoload its classes when another piece of code
       decides they don't want it any more, and turns the superloader off.

   class_exists $class
       Handy method when doing the sort of jobs that "Class::Autouse" does.
       Given a class name, it will return true if the class can be loaded (
       i.e. in @INC ), false if the class can't be loaded, and undef if the
       class name is invalid.

       Note that this does not actually load the class, just tests to see if
       it can be loaded. Loading can still fail. For a more comprehensive set
       of methods of this nature, see Class::Inspector.

   autouse_recursive $class
       The same as the "autouse" method, but autouses recursively.

   load_recursive $class
       The same as the "load" method, but loads recursively. Great for
       checking that a large class tree that might not always be loaded will
       load correctly.
