NAME
       uusched - schedule the uucp file transport program

SYNOPSIS
       uusched [ options ]

DESCRIPTION
       The  uusched  program is actually just a shell script which invokes the
       uucico daemon.  It is provided for backward compatibility.   It	causes
       uucico  to  call all systems for which there is work.  Any option which
       may be given to uucico may  also  be  given  to	uusched  .   For  more
       details, see uucico(8) .
