FCLOSE(3)		 BSD Library Functions Manual		     FCLOSE(3)

NAME
     fclose, fcloseall -- close a stream

LIBRARY
     Standard C Library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
     #include &ltstdio.h&gt

     int
     fclose(FILE *stream);

     void
     fcloseall(void);

DESCRIPTION
     The fclose() function dissociates the named stream from its underlying
     file or set of functions.	If the stream was being used for output, any
     buffered data is written first, using fflush(3).

     The fcloseall() function calls fclose() on all open streams.

RETURN VALUES
     Upon successful completion 0 is returned.	Otherwise, EOF is returned and
     the global variable errno is set to indicate the error.  In either case
     no further access to the stream is possible.

ERRORS
     The fclose() function may also fail and set errno for any of the errors
     specified for the routines close(2) or fflush(3).

NOTES
     The fclose() function does not handle NULL arguments; they will result in
     a segmentation violation.	This is intentional - it makes it easier to
     make sure programs written under FreeBSD are bug free.  This behaviour is
     an implementation detail, and programs should not rely upon it.

SEE ALSO
     close(2), fflush(3), fopen(3), setbuf(3)

STANDARDS
     The fclose() function conforms to ISO/IEC 9899:1990 (``ISO C90'').

     The fcloseall() function first appeared in FreeBSD 7.0.
