NAME
       glCopyBufferSubData - copy part of the data store of a buffer object to
       the data store of another buffer object

C SPECIFICATION
       void glCopyBufferSubData(GLenum readtarget, GLenum writetarget,
				GLintptr readoffset, GLintptr writeoffset,
				GLsizeiptr size);

PARAMETERS
       readtarget
	   Specifies the target from whose data store data should be read.

       writetarget
	   Specifies the target to whose data store data should be written.

       readoffset
	   Specifies the offset, in basic machine units, within the data store
	   of readtarget from which data should be read.

       writeoffset
	   Specifies the offset, in basic machine units, within the data store
	   of writetarget to which data should be written.

       size
	   Specifies the size, in basic machine units, of the data to be
	   copied from readtarget to writetarget.

DESCRIPTION
       glCopyBufferSubData copies part of the data store attached to
       readtarget to the data store attached to writetarget. The number of
       basic machine units indicated by size is copied from the source, at
       offset readoffset to the destination at writeoffset, also in basic
       machine units.


       readtarget and writetarget must be GL_ARRAY_BUFFER,
       GL_COPY_READ_BUFFER, GL_COPY_WRITE_BUFFER, GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER,
       GL_PIXEL_PACK_BUFFER, GL_PIXEL_UNPACK_BUFFER, GL_TEXTURE_BUFFER,
       GL_TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_BUFFER or GL_UNIFORM_BUFFER. Any of these targets
       may be used, although the targets GL_COPY_READ_BUFFER and
       GL_COPY_WRITE_BUFFER are provided specifically to allow copies between
       buffers without disturbing other GL state.


       readoffset, writeoffset and size must all be greater than or equal to
       zero. Furthermore, readoffset + size must not exceeed the size of the
       buffer object bound to readtarget, and readoffset + size must not
       exceeed the size of the buffer bound to writetarget. If the same buffer
       object is bound to both readtarget and writetarget, then the ranges
       specified by readoffset, writeoffset and size must not overlap.

NOTES
       glCopyBufferSubData is available only if the GL version is 3.1 or
       greater.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if any of readoffset, writeoffset or size
       is negative, if readoffset + size exceeds the size of the buffer object
       bound to readtarget or if writeoffset + size exceeds the size of the
       buffer object bound to writetarget.


       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if the same buffer object is bound to
       both readtarget and writetarget and the ranges [readoffset, readoffset
       + size) and [writeoffset, writeoffset + size) overlap.


       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if zero is bound to readtarget or
       writetarget.


       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if the buffer object bound to either
       readtarget or writetarget is mapped.
