NAME
     securityd -- Security context daemon for Authorization and cryptographic
     operations

SYNOPSIS
     securityd

DESCRIPTION
     securityd maintains security contexts and arbitrates cryptographic opera-
     tions and Security Authorizations. Access to keychain items is routed
     through securityd to enforce access controls and to keep private keys out
     of user process address space.  Authorization calls also communicate with
     securityd to enforce rules contained in the /etc/authorization database.
     All user interaction with securityd is mediated through the Security
     Agent.

     This command is not intended to be invoked directly.

HISTORY
     securityd was first introduced in Mac OS X version 10.0 (Cheetah) as the
     "Security Server" and was renamed in 10.4 (Tiger).
