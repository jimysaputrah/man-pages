NAME
       Moose::Cookbook::Basics::Recipe11 - Extending a non-Moose base class

SYNOPSIS
	 package My::DateTime;

	 use Moose;
	 extends qw( DateTime Moose::Object );

	 use DateTime::Calendar::Mayan;

	 has 'mayan_date' =&gt (
	     is        =&gt 'ro',
	     isa       =&gt 'DateTime::Calendar::Mayan',
	     init_arg  =&gt undef,
	     lazy      =&gt 1,
	     builder   =&gt '_build_mayan_date',
	     clearer   =&gt '_clear_mayan_date',
	     predicate =&gt 'has_mayan_date',
	 );

	 sub new {
	     my $class = shift;

	     my $obj = $class-&gtSUPER::new(@_);

	     return $class-&gtmeta-&gtnew_object(
		 __INSTANCE__ =&gt $obj,
		 @_,
	     );
	 }

	 after 'set' =&gt sub {
	     $_[0]-&gt_clear_mayan_date;
	 };

	 sub _build_mayan_date {
	     DateTime::Calendar::Mayan-&gtfrom_object( object =&gt $_[0] );
	 }

DESCRIPTION
       This recipe demonstrates how to use Moose to subclass a parent which is
       not Moose based. This recipe only works if the parent class uses a
       blessed hash reference for object instances. If your parent is doing
       something funkier, you should check out MooseX::InsideOut.

       You might also want to check out MooseX::NonMoose, which does all the
       grunt work for you.

       There are a couple pieces worth noting:

	 use Moose;
	 extends qw( DateTime Moose::Object );

       First, we "use Moose" just like we always do. This lets us declare
       attributes and use all the Moose sugar to which we are accustomed.

       The "extends" declaration explicitly include Moose::Object as well as
       DateTime. This lets us use methods which are provided by Moose::Object,
       like "does".

       The constructor demonstrates a particular hack/pattern (hacktern?) for
       working with non-Moose parent classes:

	 sub new {
	     my $class = shift;

	     my $obj = $class-&gtSUPER::new(@_);

	     return $class-&gtmeta-&gtnew_object(
		 __INSTANCE__ =&gt $obj,
		 @_,
	     );
	 }

       We explicitly call "$class-&gtmeta-&gtnew_object" and pass the already-
       created object in the "__INSTANCE__" key. Internally, Moose will take
       the existing object and initialize any attributes defined in our
       subclass.

       The "after" modifier works just like we'd expect. The fact that "set"
       is defined in our non-Moose parent does not matter.

CONCLUSION
       Moose can play nice with non-Moose classes when you follow the pattern
       shown here. Your subclass has access to all the power of Moose,
       including attribute declaration, method modifiers, type constraints
       (for new attributes), and roles.

       However, you won't be able to easily override a parent's "attributes",
       since they're not Moose attributes. Nor will you be able to inline a
       constructor, since you need to explicitly use the metaclass's object
       constructor.
