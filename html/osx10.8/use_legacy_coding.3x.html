NAME
       use_legacy_coding - use terminal's default colors

SYNOPSIS
       #include &ltcurses.h&gt

       int use_legacy_coding(int level);

DESCRIPTION
       The use_legacy_coding() function is an extension to the curses library.
       It allows the caller to change  the  result  of	unctrl,  and  suppress
       related checks within the library that would normally cause nonprinting
       characters to be rendered in visible form.   This  affects  only  8-bit
       characters.

       The level parameter controls the result:

	      0    the library functions normally, rendering nonprinting char-
		   acters as described in unctrl.

	      1    the	library  ignores  isprintf  for  codes	in  the  range
		   160-255.

	      2    the	library  ignores  isprintf  for  codes	in  the  range
		   128-255.  It also modifies the output  of  unctrl,  showing
		   codes in the range 128-159 as is.

RETURN VALUE
       If  the	screen has not been initialized, or the level parameter is out
       of range, the function returns ERR.  Otherwise, it returns the previous
       level: 0, 1 or 2.

PORTABILITY
       This  routine  is specific to ncurses.  It was not supported on Version
       7, BSD or System V implementations.  It is recommended  that  any  code
       depending on ncurses extensions be conditioned using NCURSES_VERSION.

SEE ALSO
       unctrl.
