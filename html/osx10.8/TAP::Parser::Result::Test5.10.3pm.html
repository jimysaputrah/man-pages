NAME
       TAP::Parser::Result::Test - Test result token.

VERSION
       Version 3.17

DESCRIPTION
       This is a subclass of TAP::Parser::Result.  A token of this class will
       be returned if a test line is encountered.

	1..1
	ok 1 - woo hooo!

OVERRIDDEN METHODS
       This class is the workhorse of the TAP::Parser system.  Most TAP lines
       will be test lines and if "$result->is_test", then you have a bunch of
       methods at your disposal.

   Instance Methods
       "ok"

	 my $ok = $result->ok;

       Returns the literal text of the "ok" or "not ok" status.

       "number"

	 my $test_number = $result->number;

       Returns the number of the test, even if the original TAP output did not
       supply that number.

       "description"

	 my $description = $result->description;

       Returns the description of the test, if any.  This is the portion after
       the test number but before the directive.

       "directive"

	 my $directive = $result->directive;

       Returns either "TODO" or "SKIP" if either directive was present for a
       test line.

       "explanation"

	 my $explanation = $result->explanation;

       If a test had either a "TODO" or "SKIP" directive, this method will
       return the accompanying explantion, if present.

	 not ok 17 - 'Pigs can fly' # TODO not enough acid

       For the above line, the explanation is not enough acid.

       "is_ok"

	 if ( $result->is_ok ) { ... }

       Returns a boolean value indicating whether or not the test passed.
       Remember that for TODO tests, the test always passes.

       If the test is unplanned, this method will always return false.	See
       "is_unplanned".

       "is_actual_ok"

	 if ( $result->is_actual_ok ) { ... }

       Returns a boolean value indicating whether or not the test passed,
       regardless of its TODO status.

       "actual_passed"

       Deprecated.  Please use "is_actual_ok" instead.

       "todo_passed"

	 if ( $test->todo_passed ) {
	    # test unexpectedly succeeded
	 }

       If this is a TODO test and an 'ok' line, this method returns true.
       Otherwise, it will always return false (regardless of passing status on
       non-todo tests).

       This is used to track which tests unexpectedly succeeded.

       "todo_failed"

	 # deprecated in favor of 'todo_passed'.  This method was horribly misnamed.

       This was a badly misnamed method.  It indicates which TODO tests
       unexpectedly succeeded.	Will now issue a warning and call
       "todo_passed".

       "has_skip"

	 if ( $result->has_skip ) { ... }

       Returns a boolean value indicating whether or not this test has a SKIP
       directive.

       "has_todo"

	 if ( $result->has_todo ) { ... }

       Returns a boolean value indicating whether or not this test has a TODO
       directive.

       "as_string"

	 print $result->as_string;

       This method prints the test as a string.  It will probably be similar,
       but not necessarily identical, to the original test line.  Directives
       are capitalized, some whitespace may be trimmed and a test number will
       be added if it was not present in the original line.  If you need the
       original text of the test line, use the "raw" method.

       "is_unplanned"

	 if ( $test->is_unplanned ) { ... }
	 $test->is_unplanned(1);

       If a test number is greater than the number of planned tests, this
       method will return true.  Unplanned tests will always return false for
       "is_ok", regardless of whether or not the test "has_todo".

       Note that if tests have a trailing plan, it is not possible to set this
       property for unplanned tests as we do not know it's unplanned until the
       plan is reached:

	 print <<'END';
	 ok 1
	 ok 2
	 1..1
	 END
