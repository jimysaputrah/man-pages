NAME
       SSL_CTX_set_session_cache_mode, SSL_CTX_get_session_cache_mode -
       enable/disable session caching

SYNOPSIS
	#include <openssl/ssl.h>

	long SSL_CTX_set_session_cache_mode(SSL_CTX ctx, long mode);
	long SSL_CTX_get_session_cache_mode(SSL_CTX ctx);

DESCRIPTION
       SSL_CTX_set_session_cache_mode() enables/disables session caching by
       setting the operational mode for ctx to <mode>.

       SSL_CTX_get_session_cache_mode() returns the currently used cache mode.

NOTES
       The OpenSSL library can store/retrieve SSL/TLS sessions for later
       reuse.  The sessions can be held in memory for each ctx, if more than
       one SSL_CTX object is being maintained, the sessions are unique for
       each SSL_CTX object.

       In order to reuse a session, a client must send the session's id to the
       server. It can only send exactly one id.  The server then either agrees
       to reuse the session or it starts a full handshake (to create a new
       session).

       A server will lookup up the session in its internal session storage. If
       the session is not found in internal storage or lookups for the
       internal storage have been deactivated
       (SSL_SESS_CACHE_NO_INTERNAL_LOOKUP), the server will try the external
       storage if available.

       Since a client may try to reuse a session intended for use in a
       different context, the session id context must be set by the server
       (see SSL_CTX_set_session_id_context(3)).

       The following session cache modes and modifiers are available:

       SSL_SESS_CACHE_OFF
	   No session caching for client or server takes place.

       SSL_SESS_CACHE_CLIENT
	   Client sessions are added to the session cache. As there is no
	   reliable way for the OpenSSL library to know whether a session
	   should be reused or which session to choose (due to the abstract
	   BIO layer the SSL engine does not have details about the
	   connection), the application must select the session to be reused
	   by using the SSL_set_session(3) function. This option is not
	   activated by default.

       SSL_SESS_CACHE_SERVER
	   Server sessions are added to the session cache. When a client
	   proposes a session to be reused, the server looks for the
	   corresponding session in (first) the internal session cache (unless
	   SSL_SESS_CACHE_NO_INTERNAL_LOOKUP is set), then (second) in the
	   external cache if available. If the session is found, the server
	   will try to reuse the session.  This is the default.

       SSL_SESS_CACHE_BOTH
	   Enable both SSL_SESS_CACHE_CLIENT and SSL_SESS_CACHE_SERVER at the
	   same time.

       SSL_SESS_CACHE_NO_AUTO_CLEAR
	   Normally the session cache is checked for expired sessions every
	   255 connections using the SSL_CTX_flush_sessions(3) function. Since
	   this may lead to a delay which cannot be controlled, the automatic
	   flushing may be disabled and SSL_CTX_flush_sessions(3) can be
	   called explicitly by the application.

       SSL_SESS_CACHE_NO_INTERNAL_LOOKUP
	   By setting this flag, session-resume operations in an SSL/TLS
	   server will not automatically look up sessions in the internal
	   cache, even if sessions are automatically stored there. If external
	   session caching callbacks are in use, this flag guarantees that all
	   lookups are directed to the external cache.	As automatic lookup
	   only applies for SSL/TLS servers, the flag has no effect on
	   clients.

       SSL_SESS_CACHE_NO_INTERNAL_STORE
	   Depending on the presence of SSL_SESS_CACHE_CLIENT and/or
	   SSL_SESS_CACHE_SERVER, sessions negotiated in an SSL/TLS handshake
	   may be cached for possible reuse.  Normally a new session is added
	   to the internal cache as well as any external session caching
	   (callback) that is configured for the SSL_CTX. This flag will
	   prevent sessions being stored in the internal cache (though the
	   application can add them manually using SSL_CTX_add_session(3)).
	   Note: in any SSL/TLS servers where external caching is configured,
	   any successful session lookups in the external cache (ie. for
	   session-resume requests) would normally be copied into the local
	   cache before processing continues - this flag prevents these
	   additions to the internal cache as well.

       SSL_SESS_CACHE_NO_INTERNAL
	   Enable both SSL_SESS_CACHE_NO_INTERNAL_LOOKUP and
	   SSL_SESS_CACHE_NO_INTERNAL_STORE at the same time.

       The default mode is SSL_SESS_CACHE_SERVER.

RETURN VALUES
       SSL_CTX_set_session_cache_mode() returns the previously set cache mode.

       SSL_CTX_get_session_cache_mode() returns the currently set cache mode.
