NAME
       File::stat - by-name interface to Perl's built-in stat() functions

SYNOPSIS
	use File::stat;
	$st = stat($file) or die "No $file: $!";
	if ( ($st-&gtmode & 0111) && $st-&gtnlink &gt 1) ) {
	    print "$file is executable with lotsa links\n";
	}

	use File::stat qw(:FIELDS);
	stat($file) or die "No $file: $!";
	if ( ($st_mode & 0111) && ($st_nlink &gt 1) ) {
	    print "$file is executable with lotsa links\n";
	}

DESCRIPTION
       This module's default exports override the core stat() and lstat()
       functions, replacing them with versions that return "File::stat"
       objects.  This object has methods that return the similarly named
       structure field name from the stat(2) function; namely, dev, ino, mode,
       nlink, uid, gid, rdev, size, atime, mtime, ctime, blksize, and blocks.

       You may also import all the structure fields directly into your
       namespace as regular variables using the :FIELDS import tag.  (Note
       that this still overrides your stat() and lstat() functions.)  Access
       these fields as variables named with a preceding "st_" in front their
       method names.  Thus, "$stat_obj-&gtdev()" corresponds to $st_dev if you
       import the fields.

       To access this functionality without the core overrides, pass the "use"
       an empty import list, and then access function functions with their
       full qualified names.  On the other hand, the built-ins are still
       available via the "CORE::" pseudo-package.

BUGS
       As of Perl 5.8.0 after using this module you cannot use the implicit $_
       or the special filehandle "_" with stat() or lstat(), trying to do so
       leads into strange errors.  The workaround is for $_ to be explicit

	   my $stat_obj = stat $_;

       and for "_" to explicitly populate the object using the unexported and
       undocumented populate() function with CORE::stat():

	   my $stat_obj = File::stat::populate(CORE::stat(_));

NOTE
       While this class is currently implemented using the Class::Struct
       module to build a struct-like class, you shouldn't rely upon this.
