Apache::TestRun(3)    User Contributed Perl Documentation   Apache::TestRun(3)



NAME
       Apache::TestRun - Run the test suite

SYNOPSIS
DESCRIPTION
       The "Apache::TestRun" package controls the configuration and running of
       the test suite.

METHODS
       Several methods are sub-classable, if the default behavior should be
       changed.

   "bug_report"
       The "bug_report()" method is executed when "t/TEST" was executed with
       the "-bugreport" option, and "make test" (or "t/TEST") fail. Normally
       this is callback which you can use to tell the user how to deal with
       the problem, e.g. suggesting to read some document or email some
       details to someone who can take care of it. By default nothing is
       executed.

       The "-bugreport" option is needed so this feature won't become annoying
       to developers themselves. It's automatically added to the "run_tests"
       target in Makefile. So if you repeateadly have to test your code, just
       don't use "make test" but run "t/TEST" directly. Here is an example of
       a custom "t/TEST"

	 My::TestRun-&gtnew-&gtrun(@ARGV);

	 package My::TestRun;
	 use base 'Apache::TestRun';

	 sub bug_report {
	     my $self = shift;

	     print &lt&ltEOI;
	 +--------------------------------------------------------+
	 | Please file a bug report: http://perl.apache.org/bugs/ |
	 +--------------------------------------------------------+
	 EOI
	 }

   "pre_configure"
       The "pre_configure()" method is executed before the configuration for
       "Apache::Test" is generated. So if you need to adjust the setup before
       httpd.conf and other files are autogenerated, this is the right place
       to do so.

       For example if you don't want to inherit a LoadModule directive for
       mod_apreq.so but to make sure that the local version is used, you can
       sub-class "Apache::TestRun" and override this method in t/TEST.PL:

	 package My::TestRun;
	 use base 'Apache::TestRun';
	 use Apache::TestConfig;
	 __PACKAGE__-&gtnew-&gtrun(@ARGV);

	 sub pre_configure {
	     my $self = shift;
	     # Don't load an installed mod_apreq
	     Apache::TestConfig::autoconfig_skip_module_add('mod_apreq.c');

	     $self-&gtSUPER::pre_configure();
	 }

       Notice that the extension is .c, and not .so.

       Don't forget to run the super class' c&ltpre_configure()&gt method.

   "new_test_config"
