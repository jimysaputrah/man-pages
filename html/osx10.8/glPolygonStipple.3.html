NAME
       glPolygonStipple - set the polygon stippling pattern


C SPECIFICATION
       void glPolygonStipple( const GLubyte *mask )


PARAMETERS
       mask  Specifies	a  pointer  to	a  32x32  stipple pattern that will be
	     unpacked from memory in the same way  that  glDrawPixels  unpacks
	     pixels.

DESCRIPTION
       Polygon	stippling,  like line stippling (see glLineStipple), masks out
       certain fragments produced by rasterization, creating a pattern.  Stip-
       pling is independent of polygon antialiasing.

       mask  is  a pointer to a 32x32 stipple pattern that is stored in memory
       just like the pixel data supplied to a glDrawPixels  call  with	height
       and width both equal to 32, a pixel of GL_COLOR_INDEX, and data type of
       GL_BITMAP.  That is, the stipple pattern  is  represented  as  a  32x32
       array  of  1-bit  color indices packed in unsigned bytes.  glPixelStore
       parameters like GL_UNPACK_SWAP_BYTES and GL_UNPACK_LSB_FIRST affect the
       assembling  of  the bits into a stipple pattern.  Pixel transfer opera-
       tions (shift, offset, pixel map) are not applied to the stipple	image,
       however.

       To  enable  and	disable polygon stippling, call glEnable and glDisable
       with argument GL_POLYGON_STIPPLE. Polygon stippling is  initially  dis-
       abled. If it's enabled, a rasterized polygon fragment with window coor-
       dinates xw and yw is sent to the next stage of the GL if  and  only  if
       the  (xw  mod 32)th bit in the (yw mod 32)th row of the stipple pattern
       is 1 (one).  When polygon stippling is disabled, it is as if the  stip-
       ple pattern consists of all 1's.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_OPERATION  is  generated  if	glPolygonStipple  is  executed
       between the execution of glBegin and  the  corresponding  execution  of
       glEnd.

ASSOCIATED GETS
       glGetPolygonStipple
       glIsEnabled with argument GL_POLYGON_STIPPLE
