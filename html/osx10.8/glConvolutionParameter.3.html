NAME
       glConvolutionParameterf,  glConvolutionParameteri, glConvolutionParame-
       terfv, glConvolutionParameteriv - set convolution parameters


C SPECIFICATION
       void glConvolutionParameterf( GLenum target,
				     GLenum pname,
				     GLfloat params )
       void glConvolutionParameteri( GLenum target,
				     GLenum pname,
				     GLint params )

PARAMETERS
       target  The target for the  convolution	parameter.   Must  be  one  of
	       GL_CONVOLUTION_1D, GL_CONVOLUTION_2D, or GL_SEPARABLE_2D.

       pname   The parameter to be set.  Must be GL_CONVOLUTION_BORDER_MODE.

       params  The    parameter    value.    Must   be	 one   of   GL_REDUCE,
	       GL_CONSTANT_BORDER, GL_REPLICATE_BORDER.



C SPECIFICATION
       void glConvolutionParameterfv( GLenum target,
				      GLenum pname,
				      const GLfloat *params )
       void glConvolutionParameteriv( GLenum target,
				      GLenum pname,
				      const GLint *params )

PARAMETERS
       target The target for  the  convolution	parameter.   Must  be  one  of
	      GL_CONVOLUTION_1D, GL_CONVOLUTION_2D, or GL_SEPARABLE_2D.

       pname  The    parameter	  to	be    set.     Must    be    one    of
	      GL_CONVOLUTION_BORDER_MODE,	  GL_CONVOLUTION_BORDER_COLOR,
	      GL_CONVOLUTION_FILTER_SCALE, or GL_CONVOLUTION_FILTER_BIAS.

       params The  parameter  value.   If pname is GL_CONVOLUTION_BORDER_MODE,
	      params  must  be	one  of  GL_REDUCE,   GL_CONSTANT_BORDER,   or
	      GL_REPLICATE_BORDER.  Otherwise, must be a vector of four values
	      (for red, green, blue, and alpha, respectively) to be  used  for
	      scaling  (when pname is GL_CONVOLUTION_FILTER_SCALE), or biasing
	      (when pname is GL_CONVOLUTION_FILTER_BIAS) a convolution	filter
	      kernel  or  setting  the	constant  border  color (when pname is
	      GL_CONVOLUTION_BORDER_COLOR.

DESCRIPTION
       glConvolutionParameter sets the value of a convolution parameter.

       target	selects   the	convolution    filter	 to    be    affected:
       GL_CONVOLUTION_1D,  GL_CONVOLUTION_2D,  or  GL_SEPARABLE_2D for the 1D,
       2D, or separable 2D filter, respectively.

       pname selects the parameter to be changed.  GL_CONVOLUTION_FILTER_SCALE
       and GL_CONVOLUTION_FILTER_BIAS affect the definition of the convolution
       filter kernel; see  glConvolutionFilter1D,  glConvolutionFilter2D,  and
       glSeparableFilter2D for details.  In these cases, params is an array of
       four values to be applied  to  red,  green,  blue,  and	alpha  values,
       respectively.  The initial value for GL_CONVOLUTION_FILTER_SCALE is (1,
       1, 1, 1), and the initial value for GL_CONVOLUTION_FILTER_BIAS  is  (0,
       0, 0, 0).

       A  pname  value	of GL_CONVOLUTION_BORDER_MODE controls the convolution
       border mode. The accepted modes are:

       GL_REDUCE
	      The image resulting from convolution is smaller than the	source
	      image.   If  the	filter	width  is Wf and height is Hf, and the
	      source image width is Ws and height is Hs,  then	the  convolved
	      image  width will be Ws - Wf + 1 and height will be Hs - Hf + 1.
	      (If this reduction would generate an image with zero or negative
	      width  and/or  height,  the output is simply null, with no error
	      generated.)  The coordinates of the image resulting from	convo-
	      lution  are  zero through Ws - Wf in width and zero through Hs -
	      Hf in height.

       GL_CONSTANT_BORDER
	      The image resulting from convolution is the  same  size  as  the
	      source  image,  and  processed  as if the source image were sur-
	      rounded  by  pixels  with   their   color   specified   by   the
	      GL_CONVOLUTION_BORDER_COLOR.

       GL_REPLICATE_BORDER
	      The  image  resulting  from  convolution is the same size as the
	      source image, and processed as if the  outermost	pixel  on  the
	      border of the source image were replicated.

NOTES
       glConvolutionParameter  is  present  only if GL_ARB_imaging is returned
       when glGetString is called with an argument of GL_EXTENSIONS.

       In cases where errors can result  from  the  specification  of  invalid
       image  dimensions,  it  is  the	dimensions  after convolution that are
       tested,	not  the  dimensions  of  the  source  image.	For   example,
       glTexImage1D  requires  power-of-two image size.  When GL_REDUCE border
       mode is in effect, the source image  must  be  larger  than  the  final
       power-of-two size by one less than the size of the 1D filter kernel.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if target is not one of the allowable val-
       ues.

       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if pname is not one of the allowable  val-
       ues.

       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if pname is GL_CONVOLUTION_BORDER_MODE and
       params	is   not   one	 of    GL_REDUCE,    GL_CONSTANT_BORDER,    or
       GL_REPLICATE_BORDER.

       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if glConvolutionParameter is executed
       between the execution of glBegin and  the  corresponding  execution  of
       glEnd.
