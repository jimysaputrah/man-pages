NAME
       BIO_new, BIO_set, BIO_free, BIO_vfree, BIO_free_all - BIO allocation
       and freeing functions

SYNOPSIS
	#include <openssl/bio.h>

	BIO *  BIO_new(BIO_METHOD *type);
	int    BIO_set(BIO *a,BIO_METHOD *type);
	int    BIO_free(BIO *a);
	void   BIO_vfree(BIO *a);
	void   BIO_free_all(BIO *a);

DESCRIPTION
       The BIO_new() function returns a new BIO using method type.

       BIO_set() sets the method of an already existing BIO.

       BIO_free() frees up a single BIO, BIO_vfree() also frees up a single
       BIO but it does not return a value. Calling BIO_free() may also have
       some effect on the underlying I/O structure, for example it may close
       the file being referred to under certain circumstances. For more
       details see the individual BIO_METHOD descriptions.

       BIO_free_all() frees up an entire BIO chain, it does not halt if an
       error occurs freeing up an individual BIO in the chain.

RETURN VALUES
       BIO_new() returns a newly created BIO or NULL if the call fails.

       BIO_set(), BIO_free() return 1 for success and 0 for failure.

       BIO_free_all() and BIO_vfree() do not return values.

NOTES
       Some BIOs (such as memory BIOs) can be used immediately after calling
       BIO_new(). Others (such as file BIOs) need some additional
       initialization, and frequently a utility function exists to create and
       initialize such BIOs.

       If BIO_free() is called on a BIO chain it will only free one BIO
       resulting in a memory leak.

       Calling BIO_free_all() a single BIO has the same effect as calling
       BIO_free() on it other than the discarded return value.

       Normally the type argument is supplied by a function which returns a
       pointer to a BIO_METHOD. There is a naming convention for such
       functions: a source/sink BIO is normally called BIO_s_*() and a filter
       BIO BIO_f_*();

EXAMPLE
       Create a memory BIO:

	BIO *mem = BIO_new(BIO_s_mem());
