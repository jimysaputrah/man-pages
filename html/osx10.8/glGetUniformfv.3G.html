GLGETUNIFORM(3G)		  OpenGL 3.3		      GLGETUNIFORM(3G)



NAME
       glGetUniformfv, glGetUniformiv - Returns the value of a uniform
       variable

C SPECIFICATION
       void glGetUniformfv(GLuint program, GLint location, GLfloat *params);

       void glGetUniformiv(GLuint program, GLint location, GLint *params);

PARAMETERS
       program
	   Specifies the program object to be queried.

       location
	   Specifies the location of the uniform variable to be queried.

       params
	   Returns the value of the specified uniform variable.

DESCRIPTION
       glGetUniform returns in params the value(s) of the specified uniform
       variable. The type of the uniform variable specified by location
       determines the number of values returned. If the uniform variable is
       defined in the shader as a boolean, int, or float, a single value will
       be returned. If it is defined as a vec2, ivec2, or bvec2, two values
       will be returned. If it is defined as a vec3, ivec3, or bvec3, three
       values will be returned, and so on. To query values stored in uniform
       variables declared as arrays, call glGetUniform for each element of the
       array. To query values stored in uniform variables declared as
       structures, call glGetUniform for each field in the structure. The
       values for uniform variables declared as a matrix will be returned in
       column major order.

       The locations assigned to uniform variables are not known until the
       program object is linked. After linking has occurred, the command
       glGetUniformLocation() can be used to obtain the location of a uniform
       variable. This location value can then be passed to glGetUniform in
       order to query the current value of the uniform variable. After a
       program object has been linked successfully, the index values for
       uniform variables remain fixed until the next link command occurs. The
       uniform variable values can only be queried after a link if the link
       was successful.

NOTES
       If an error is generated, no change is made to the contents of params.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if program is not a value generated by
       OpenGL.

       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if program is not a program object.

       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if program has not been successfully
       linked.

       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if location does not correspond to a
       valid uniform variable location for the specified program object.

ASSOCIATED GETS
       glGetActiveUniform() with arguments program and the index of an active
       uniform variable

       glGetProgram() with arguments program and GL_ACTIVE_UNIFORMS or
       GL_ACTIVE_UNIFORM_MAX_LENGTH

       glGetUniformLocation() with arguments program and the name of a uniform
       variable

       glIsProgram()
