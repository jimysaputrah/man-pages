______________________________________________________________________________

NAME
       Tk_InternAtom, Tk_GetAtomName - manage cache of X atoms

SYNOPSIS
       #include <tk.h>

       Atom
       Tk_InternAtom(tkwin, name)

       const char *
       Tk_GetAtomName(tkwin, atom)

ARGUMENTS
       Tk_Window tkwin (in)	      Token  for  window.  Used to map atom or
				      name relative to a particular display.

       const char *name (in)	      String name for which atom is desired.

       Atom atom (in)		      Atom for which corresponding string name
				      is desired.

DESCRIPTION
       These  procedures  are  similar	to the Xlib procedures XInternAtom and
       XGetAtomName.  Tk_InternAtom returns  the  atom	identifier  associated
       with  string  given by name;  the atom identifier is only valid for the
       display associated with tkwin.  Tk_GetAtomName returns the string asso-
       ciated	with   atom  on  tkwin's  display.   The  string  returned  by
       Tk_GetAtomName is in Tk's storage:  the caller need not free this space
       when  finished  with  the  string, and the caller should not modify the
       contents of the returned string.  If there is no atom atom  on  tkwin's
       display, then Tk_GetAtomName returns the string "?bad atom?".

       Tk  caches the information returned by Tk_InternAtom and Tk_GetAtomName
       so that future calls for the same information can be serviced from  the
       cache   without	 contacting   the   server.   Thus  Tk_InternAtom  and
       Tk_GetAtomName are generally much faster than their Xlib  counterparts,
       and they should be used in place of the Xlib procedures.
