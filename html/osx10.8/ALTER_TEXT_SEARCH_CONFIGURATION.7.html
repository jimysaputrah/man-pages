       ALTER TEXT SEARCH CONFIGURATION name SET SCHEMA new_schema

DESCRIPTION
       ALTER TEXT SEARCH CONFIGURATION changes the definition of a text search
       configuration. You can modify its mappings from token types to
       dictionaries, or change the configuration's name or owner.

       You must be the owner of the configuration to use ALTER TEXT SEARCH
       CONFIGURATION.

PARAMETERS
       name
	   The name (optionally schema-qualified) of an existing text search
	   configuration.

       token_type
	   The name of a token type that is emitted by the configuration's
	   parser.

       dictionary_name
	   The name of a text search dictionary to be consulted for the
	   specified token type(s). If multiple dictionaries are listed, they
	   are consulted in the specified order.

       old_dictionary
	   The name of a text search dictionary to be replaced in the mapping.

       new_dictionary
	   The name of a text search dictionary to be substituted for
	   old_dictionary.

       new_name
	   The new name of the text search configuration.

       new_owner
	   The new owner of the text search configuration.

       new_schema
	   The new schema for the text search configuration.

       The ADD MAPPING FOR form installs a list of dictionaries to be
       consulted for the specified token type(s); it is an error if there is
       already a mapping for any of the token types. The ALTER MAPPING FOR
       form does the same, but first removing any existing mapping for those
       token types. The ALTER MAPPING REPLACE forms substitute new_dictionary
       for old_dictionary anywhere the latter appears. This is done for only
       the specified token types when FOR appears, or for all mappings of the
       configuration when it doesn't. The DROP MAPPING form removes all
       dictionaries for the specified token type(s), causing tokens of those
       types to be ignored by the text search configuration. It is an error if
       there is no mapping for the token types, unless IF EXISTS appears.

EXAMPLES
       The following example replaces the english dictionary with the swedish
       dictionary anywhere that english is used within my_config.

	   ALTER TEXT SEARCH CONFIGURATION my_config
	     ALTER MAPPING REPLACE english WITH swedish;

COMPATIBILITY
       There is no ALTER TEXT SEARCH CONFIGURATION statement in the SQL
       standard.
