NAME
       Locale::Currency - ISO three letter codes for currency identification
       (ISO 4217)

SYNOPSIS
	   use Locale::Currency;

	   $curr = code2currency('usd');     # $curr gets 'US Dollar'
	   $code = currency2code('Euro');    # $code gets 'eur'

	   @codes   = all_currency_codes();
	   @names   = all_currency_names();

DESCRIPTION
       The "Locale::Currency" module provides access to the ISO three-letter
       codes for identifying currencies and funds, as defined in ISO 4217.
       You can either access the codes via the "conversion routines"
       (described below), or with the two functions which return lists of all
       currency codes or all currency names.

       There are two special codes defined by the standard which aren't
       understood by this module:

       XTS Specifically reserved for testing purposes.

       XXX For transactions where no currency is involved.

CONVERSION ROUTINES
       There are two conversion routines: "code2currency()" and
       "currency2code()".

       code2currency()
	   This function takes a three letter currency code and returns a
	   string which contains the name of the currency identified. If the
	   code is not a valid currency code, as defined by ISO 4217, then
	   "undef" will be returned.

	       $curr = code2currency($code);

       currency2code()
	   This function takes a currency name and returns the corresponding
	   three letter currency code, if such exists.	If the argument could
	   not be identified as a currency name, then "undef" will be
	   returned.

	       $code = currency2code('French Franc');

	   The case of the currency name is not important.  See the section
	   "KNOWN BUGS AND LIMITATIONS" below.

QUERY ROUTINES
       There are two function which can be used to obtain a list of all
       currency codes, or all currency names:

       "all_currency_codes()"
	   Returns a list of all three-letter currency codes.  The codes are
	   guaranteed to be all lower-case, and not in any particular order.

       "all_currency_names()"
	   Returns a list of all currency names for which there is a
	   corresponding three-letter currency code. The names are
	   capitalised, and not returned in any particular order.

EXAMPLES
       The following example illustrates use of the "code2currency()"
       function.  The user is prompted for a currency code, and then told the
       corresponding currency name:

	   $| = 1;    # turn off buffering

	   print "Enter currency code: ";
	   chop($code = &ltSTDIN&gt);
	   $curr = code2currency($code);
	   if (defined $curr)
	   {
	       print "$code = $curr\n";
	   }
	   else
	   {
	       print "'$code' is not a valid currency code!\n";
	   }

KNOWN BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
       o   In the current implementation, all data is read in when the module
	   is loaded, and then held in memory.	A lazy implementation would be
	   more memory friendly.

       o   This module also includes the special codes which are not for a
	   currency, such as Gold, Platinum, etc.  This might cause a problem
	   if you're using this module to display a list of currencies.  Let
	   Neil know if this does cause a problem, and we can do something
	   about it.

       o   ISO 4217 also defines a numeric code for each currency.  Currency
	   codes are not currently supported by this module, in the same way
	   Locale::Country supports multiple codesets.

       o   There are three cases where there is more than one code for the
	   same currency name.	Kwacha has two codes: mwk for Malawi, and zmk
	   for Zambia.	The Russian Ruble has two codes: rub and rur.  The
	   Belarussian Ruble has two codes: byr and byb.  The currency2code()
	   function only returns one code, so you might not get back the code
	   you expected.
