NAME
       Test::Fatal - incredibly simple helpers for testing code with
       exceptions

VERSION
       version 0.006

SYNOPSIS
	 use Test::More;
	 use Test::Fatal;

	 use System::Under::Test qw(might_die);

	 is(
	   exception { might_die; },
	   undef,
	   "the code lived",
	 );

	 isnt(
	   exception { might_die; },
	   undef,
	   "the code died",
	 );

	 isa_ok(
	   exception { might_die; },
	   'Exception::Whatever',
	   'the thrown exception',
	 );

DESCRIPTION
       Test::Fatal is an alternative to the popular Test::Exception.  It does
       much less, but should allow greater flexibility in testing exception-
       throwing code with about the same amount of typing.

       It exports one routine by default: "exception".

FUNCTIONS
   exception
	 my $exception = exception { ... };

       "exception" takes a bare block of code and returns the exception thrown
       by that block.  If no exception was thrown, it returns undef.

       ACHTUNG!  If the block results in a false exception, such as 0 or the
       empty string, Test::Fatal itself will die.  Since either of these cases
       indicates a serious problem with the system under testing, this
       behavior is considered a feature.  If you must test for these
       conditions, you should use Try::Tiny's try/catch mechanism.  (Try::Tiny
       is the underlying exception handling system of Test::Fatal.)

       Note that there is no TAP assert being performed.  In other words, no
       "ok" or "not ok" line is emitted.  It's up to you to use the rest of
       "exception" in an existing test like "ok", "isa_ok", "is", et cetera.
       Or you may wish to use the "dies_ok" and "lives_ok" wrappers, which do
       provide TAP output.

       "exception" does not alter the stack presented to the called block,
       meaning that if the exception returned has a stack trace, it will
       include some frames between the code calling "exception" and the thing
       throwing the exception.	This is considered a feature because it avoids
       the occasionally twitchy "Sub::Uplevel" mechanism.

       Achtung!  This is not a great idea:

	 like( exception { ... }, qr/foo/, "foo appears in the exception" );

       If the code in the "..." is going to throw a stack trace with the
       arguments to each subroutine in its call stack, the test name, "foo
       appears in the exception" will itself be matched by the regex.
       Instead, write this:

	 my $exception = exception { ... };
	 like( $exception, qr/foo/, "foo appears in the exception" );

   success
	 try {
	   should_live;
	 } catch {
	   fail("boo, we died");
	 } success {
	   pass("hooray, we lived");
	 };

       "success", exported only by request, is a Try::Tiny helper with
       semantics identical to "finally", but the body of the block will only
       be run if the "try" block ran without error.

       Although almost any needed exception tests can be performed with
       "exception", success blocks may sometimes help organize complex
       testing.

   dies_ok
   lives_ok
       Exported only by request, these two functions run a given block of
       code, and provide TAP output indicating if it did, or did not throw an
       exception.  These provide an easy upgrade path for replacing existing
       unit tests based on "Test::Exception".

       RJBS does not using this except as a convenience while porting tests to
       use Test::Fatal's "exception" routine.

	 use Test::More tests =&gt 2;
	 use Test::Fatal qw(dies_ok lives_ok);

	 dies_ok { die "I failed" } 'code that fails';

	 lives_ok { return "I'm still alive" } 'code that does not fail';
