NAME
       URI::ldap - LDAP Uniform Resource Locators

SYNOPSIS
	 use URI;

	 $uri = URI->new("ldap:$uri_string");
	 $dn	 = $uri->dn;
	 $filter = $uri->filter;
	 @attr	 = $uri->attributes;
	 $scope  = $uri->scope;
	 %extn	 = $uri->extensions;

	 $uri = URI->new("ldap:");  # start empty
	 $uri->host("ldap.itd.umich.edu");
	 $uri->dn("o=University of Michigan,c=US");
	 $uri->attributes(qw(postalAddress));
	 $uri->scope('sub');
	 $uri->filter('(cn=Babs Jensen)');
	 print $uri->as_string,"\n";

DESCRIPTION
       "URI::ldap" provides an interface to parse an LDAP URI into its
       constituent parts and also to build a URI as described in RFC 2255.

METHODS
       "URI::ldap" supports all the generic and server methods defined by URI,
       plus the following.

       Each of the following methods can be used to set or get the value in
       the URI. The values are passed in unescaped form.  None of these return
       undefined values, but elements without a default can be empty.  If
       arguments are given, then a new value is set for the given part of the
       URI.

       $uri->dn( [$new_dn] )
	   Sets or gets the Distinguished Name part of the URI.  The DN
	   identifies the base object of the LDAP search.

       $uri->attributes( [@new_attrs] )
	   Sets or gets the list of attribute names which are returned by the
	   search.

       $uri->scope( [$new_scope] )
	   Sets or gets the scope to be used by the search. The value can be
	   one of "base", "one" or "sub". If none is given in the URI then the
	   return value defaults to "base".

       $uri->_scope( [$new_scope] )
	   Same as scope(), but does not default to anything.

       $uri->filter( [$new_filter] )
	   Sets or gets the filter to be used by the search. If none is given
	   in the URI then the return value defaults to "(objectClass=*)".

       $uri->_filter( [$new_filter] )
	   Same as filter(), but does not default to anything.

       $uri->extensions( [$etype => $evalue,...] )
	   Sets or gets the extensions used for the search. The list passed
	   should be in the form etype1 => evalue1, etype2 => evalue2,... This
	   is also the form of list that is returned.
