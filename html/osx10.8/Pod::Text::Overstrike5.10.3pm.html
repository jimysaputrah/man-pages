NAME
       Pod::Text::Overstrike - Convert POD data to formatted overstrike text

SYNOPSIS
	   use Pod::Text::Overstrike;
	   my $parser = Pod::Text::Overstrike->new (sentence => 0, width => 78);

	   # Read POD from STDIN and write to STDOUT.
	   $parser->parse_from_filehandle;

	   # Read POD from file.pod and write to file.txt.
	   $parser->parse_from_file ('file.pod', 'file.txt');

DESCRIPTION
       Pod::Text::Overstrike is a simple subclass of Pod::Text that highlights
       output text using overstrike sequences, in a manner similar to nroff.
       Characters in bold text are overstruck (character, backspace,
       character) and characters in underlined text are converted to
       overstruck underscores (underscore, backspace, character).  This format
       was originally designed for hard-copy terminals and/or line printers,
       yet is readable on soft-copy (CRT) terminals.

       Overstruck text is best viewed by page-at-a-time programs that take
       advantage of the terminal's stand-out and underline capabilities, such
       as the less program on Unix.

       Apart from the overstrike, it in all ways functions like Pod::Text.
       See Pod::Text for details and available options.

BUGS
       Currently, the outermost formatting instruction wins, so for example
       underlined text inside a region of bold text is displayed as simply
       bold.  There may be some better approach possible.
