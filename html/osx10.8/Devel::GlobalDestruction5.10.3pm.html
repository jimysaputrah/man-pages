Devel::GlobalDestructiUser)Contributed Perl DocumenDevel::GlobalDestruction(3)



NAME
       Devel::GlobalDestruction - Expose PL_dirty, the flag which marks global
       destruction.

SYNOPSIS
	       package Foo;
	       use Devel::GlobalDestruction;

	       use namespace::clean; # to avoid having an "in_global_destruction" method

	       sub DESTROY {
		       return if in_global_destruction;

		       do_something_a_little_tricky();
	       }

DESCRIPTION
       Perl's global destruction is a little tricky to deal with WRT
       finalizers because it's not ordered and objects can sometimes
       disappear.

       Writing defensive destructors is hard and annoying, and usually if
       global destruction is happenning you only need the destructors that
       free up non process local resources to actually execute.

       For these constructors you can avoid the mess by simply bailing out if
       global destruction is in effect.

EXPORTS
       This module uses Sub::Exporter so the exports may be renamed, aliased,
       etc.

       in_global_destruction
	   Returns the current value of "PL_dirty".

VERSION CONTROL
       This module is maintained using Darcs. You can get the latest version
       from &lthttp://nothingmuch.woobling.org/code&gt, and use "darcs send" to
