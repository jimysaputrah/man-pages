AU_BSM_TO_DOMAIN(3)	 BSD Library Functions Manual	   AU_BSM_TO_DOMAIN(3)

NAME
     au_bsm_to_domain, au_domain_to_bsm -- convert between BSM and local pro-
     tocol domains

LIBRARY
     Basic Security Module Library (libbsm, -lbsm)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <bsm/libbsm.h>

     int
     au_bsm_to_domain(u_short bsm_domain, int *local_domainp);

     u_short
     au_domain_to_bsm(int local_domain);

DESCRIPTION
     These interfaces may be used to convert between the local and BSM proto-
     col domains.  The au_bsm_to_domain() function accepts a BSM domain,
     bsm_domain, and converts it to a local domain, such as those passed to
     socket(2), that will be stored in the integer pointed to by local_domainp
     if successful.  This call will fail if the BSM domain cannot be mapped
     into a local domain, which may occur if the socket token was generated on
     another operating system.

     The au_domain_to_bsm() function accepts a local domain, and returns the
     BSM domain for it.  This call cannot fail, and instead returns a BSM
     domain indicating to a later decoder that the domain could not be
     encoded.

RETURN VALULES
     On success, au_bsm_to_domain() returns 0 and a converted domain; on fail-
     ure, it returns -1 but does not set errno(2).

SEE ALSO

HISTORY
     au_bsm_to_domain() and au_domain_to_bsm() were introduced in OpenBSM 1.1.

AUTHORS
     These functions were implemented by Robert Watson under contract to Apple
     Inc.

     The Basic Security Module (BSM) interface to audit records and audit
     event stream format were defined by Sun Microsystems.
