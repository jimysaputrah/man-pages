DBD::Gofer::Transport:UsereContributed Perl DDBD::Gofer::Transport::pipeone(3)



NAME
       DBD::Gofer::Transport::pipeone - DBD::Gofer client transport for
       testing

SYNOPSIS
	 $original_dsn = "...";
	 DBI-&gtconnect("dbi:Gofer:transport=pipeone;dsn=$original_dsn",...)

       or, enable by setting the DBI_AUTOPROXY environment variable:

	 export DBI_AUTOPROXY="dbi:Gofer:transport=pipeone"

DESCRIPTION
       Connect via DBD::Gofer and execute each request by starting executing a
       subprocess.

       This is, as you might imagine, spectacularly inefficient!

       It's only intended for testing. Specifically it demonstrates that the
       server side is completely stateless.

       It also provides a base class for the much more useful
       DBD::Gofer::Transport::stream transport.
