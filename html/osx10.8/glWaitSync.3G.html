NAME
       glWaitSync - instruct the GL server to block until the specified sync
       object becomes signaled

C SPECIFICATION
       void glWaitSync(GLsync sync, GLbitfield flags, GLuint64 timeout);

PARAMETERS
       sync
	   Specifies the sync object whose status to wait on.

       flags
	   A bitfield controlling the command flushing behavior.  flags may be
	   zero.

       timeout
	   Specifies the timeout that the server should wait before
	   continuing.	timeout must be GL_TIMEOUT_IGNORED.

DESCRIPTION
       glWaitSync causes the GL server to block and wait until sync becomes
       signaled.  sync is the name of an existing sync object upon which to
       wait.  flags and timeout are currently not used and must be set to zero
       and the special value GL_TIMEOUT_IGNORED, respectively[1].  glWaitSync
       will always wait no longer than an implementation-dependent timeout.
       The duration of this timeout in nanoseconds may be queried by calling
       glGet() with the parameter GL_MAX_SERVER_WAIT_TIMEOUT. There is
       currently no way to determine whether glWaitSync unblocked because the
       timeout expired or because the sync object being waited on was
       signaled.

       If an error occurs, glWaitSync does not cause the GL server to block.

NOTES
       glWaitSync is available only if the GL version is 3.2 or higher.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if sync is not the name of a sync
       object.


       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if flags is not zero.


       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if timeout is not GL_TIMEOUT_IGNORED.

NOTES
	1. flags and timeout are placeholders for anticipated future
	   extensions of sync object capabilities. They must have these
	   reserved values in order that existing code calling glWaitSync
	   operate properly in the presence of such extensions.
