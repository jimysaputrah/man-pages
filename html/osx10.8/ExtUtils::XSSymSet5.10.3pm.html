NAME
       ExtUtils::XSSymSet - keep sets of symbol names palatable to the VMS
       linker

SYNOPSIS
	 use ExtUtils::XSSymSet;

	 $set = new ExtUtils::XSSymSet;
	 while ($sym = make_symbol()) { $set->addsym($sym); }
	 foreach $safesym ($set->all_trimmed) {
	   print "Processing $safesym (derived from ",$self->get_orig($safesym),")\n";
	   do_stuff($safesym);
	 }

	 $safesym = ExtUtils::XSSymSet->trimsym($onesym);

DESCRIPTION
       Since the VMS linker distinguishes symbols based only on the first 31
       characters of their names, it is occasionally necessary to shorten
       symbol names in order to avoid collisions.  (This is especially true of
       names generated by xsubpp, since prefixes generated by nested package
       names can become quite long.)  "ExtUtils::XSSymSet" provides functions
       to shorten names in a consistent fashion, and to track a set of names
       to insure that each is unique.  While designed with xsubpp in mind, it
       may be used with any set of strings.

       This package supplies the following functions, all of which should be
       called as methods.

       new([$maxlen[,$silent]])
	   Creates an empty "ExtUtils::XSSymset" set of symbols.  This
	   function may be called as a static method or via an existing
	   object.  If $maxlen or $silent are specified, they are used as the
	   defaults for maximum name length and warning behavior in future
	   calls to addsym() or trimsym() via this object.

       addsym($name[,$maxlen[,$silent]])
	   Creates a symbol name from $name, using the methods described under
	   trimsym(), which is unique in this set of symbols, and returns the
	   new name.  $name and its resultant are added to the set, and any
	   future calls to addsym() specifying the same $name will return the
	   same result, regardless of the value of $maxlen specified.  Unless
	   $silent is true, warnings are output if $name had to be trimmed or
	   changed in order to avoid collision with an existing symbol name.
	   $maxlen and $silent default to the values specified when this set
	   of symbols was created.  This method must be called via an existing
	   object.

       trimsym($name[,$maxlen[,$silent]])
	   Creates a symbol name $maxlen or fewer characters long from $name
	   and returns it. If $name is too long, it first tries to shorten it
	   by removing duplicate characters, then by periodically removing
	   non-underscore characters, and finally, if necessary, by
	   periodically removing characters of any type.  $maxlen defaults to
	   31.	Unless $silent is true, a warning is output if $name is
	   altered in any way.	This function may be called either as a static
	   method or via an existing object, but in the latter case no check
	   is made to insure that the resulting name is unique in the set of
	   symbols.

       delsym($name)
	   Removes $name from the set of symbols, where $name is the original
	   symbol name passed previously to addsym().  If $name existed in the
	   set of symbols, returns its "trimmed" equivalent, otherwise returns
	   "undef".  This method must be called via an existing object.

       get_orig($trimmed)
	   Returns the original name which was trimmed to $trimmed by a
	   previous call to addsym(), or "undef" if $trimmed does not
	   correspond to a member of this set of symbols.  This method must be
	   called via an existing object.

       get_trimmed($name)
	   Returns the trimmed name which was generated from $name by a
	   previous call to addsym(), or "undef" if $name is not a member of
	   this set of symbols.  This method must be called via an existing
	   object.

       all_orig()
	   Returns a list containing all of the original symbol names from
	   this set.

       all_trimmed()
	   Returns a list containing all of the trimmed symbol names from this
	   set.
