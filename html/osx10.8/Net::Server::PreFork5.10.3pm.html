NAME
       Net::Server::PreFork - Net::Server personality

SYNOPSIS
	 use Net::Server::PreFork;
	 @ISA = qw(Net::Server::PreFork);

	 sub process_request {
	    #...code...
	 }

	 __PACKAGE__-&gtrun();

DESCRIPTION
       Please read the pod on Net::Server and Net::Server::PreForkSimple
       first.  This module is a personality, or extension, or sub class, of
       the Net::Server::PreForkSimple class which is a sub class of
       Net::Server.  See Net::Server::PreForkSimple.

       This personality binds to one or more ports and then forks
       "min_servers" child process.  The server will make sure that at any
       given time there are "min_spare_servers" available to receive a client
       request, up to "max_servers".  Each of these children will process up
       to "max_requests" client connections.  This type is good for a heavily
       hit site, and should scale well for most applications.  (Multi port
       accept is accomplished using flock to serialize the children).

       At this time, it does not appear that this module will pass tests on
       Win32 systems.  Any ideas or patches for making the tests pass would be
       welcome.

SAMPLE CODE
       Please see the sample listed in Net::Server.

COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS
       In addition to the command line arguments of the Net::Server base class
       and the Net::Server::PreForkSimple parent class, Net::Server::PreFork
       contains several other configurable parameters.	You really should also
       see Net::Server::PreForkSimple.

	 Key		     Value		     Default
	 min_servers	     \d+		     5
	 min_spare_servers   \d+		     2
	 max_spare_servers   \d+		     10
	 max_servers	     \d+		     50
	 max_requests	     \d+		     1000

	 serialize	     (flock|semaphore|pipe)  undef
	 # serialize defaults to flock on multi_port or on Solaris
	 lock_file	     "filename" 	     POSIX::tmpnam

	 check_for_dead      \d+		     30
	 check_for_waiting   \d+		     10

	 max_dequeue	     \d+		     undef
	 check_for_dequeue   \d+		     undef

	 child_communication 1			     undef

       min_servers
	   The minimum number of servers to keep running.

       min_spare_servers
	   The minimum number of servers to have waiting for requests.
	   Minimum and maximum numbers should not be set to close to each
	   other or the server will fork and kill children too often.

       max_spare_servers
	   The maximum number of servers to have waiting for requests.	See
	   min_spare_servers.

       max_servers
	   The maximum number of child servers to start.  This does not apply
	   to dequeue processes.

       check_for_waiting
	   Seconds to wait before checking to see if we can kill off some
	   waiting servers.

       child_communication
	   Enable child communication to parent via unix sockets.  If set to
	   true, will let children write to the socket contained in
	   $self-&gt{server}-&gt{parent_sock}.  The parent will be notified
	   through child_is_talking_hook where the first argument is the
	   socket to the child.  The child's socket is stored in
	   $self-&gt{server}-&gt{children}-&gt{$child_pid}-&gt{sock}.

CONFIGURATION FILE
       "Net::Server::PreFork" allows for the use of a configuration file to
       read in server parameters.  The format of this conf file is simple key
       value pairs.  Comments and white space are ignored.

	 #-------------- file test.conf --------------

	 ### server information
	 min_servers   20
	 max_servers   80
	 min_spare_servers 10
	 min_spare_servers 15

	 max_requests  1000

	 ### user and group to become
	 user	     somebody
	 group	     everybody

	 ### logging ?
	 log_file    /var/log/server.log
	 log_level   3
	 pid_file    /tmp/server.pid

	 ### access control
	 allow	     .+\.(net|com)
	 allow	     domain\.com
	 deny	     a.+

	 ### background the process?
	 background  1

	 ### ports to bind
	 host	     127.0.0.1
	 port	     localhost:20204
	 port	     20205

	 ### reverse lookups ?
	 # reverse_lookups on

	 ### enable child communication ?
	 # child_communication

	 #-------------- file test.conf --------------

PROCESS FLOW
       Process flow follows Net::Server until the loop phase.  At this point
       "min_servers" are forked and wait for connections.  When a child
       accepts a connection, finishs processing a client, or exits, it relays
       that information to the parent, which keeps track and makes sure there
       are enough children to fulfill "min_servers", "min_spare_servers",
       "max_spare_servers", and "max_servers".

HOOKS
       The PreFork server has the following hooks in addition to the hooks
       provided by PreForkSimple.  See Net::Server::PreForkSimple.

       "$self-&gtrun_n_children_hook()"
	   This hook occurs at the top of run_n_children which is called each
	   time the server goes to start more child processes.	This gives the
	   parent to do a little of its own accountting (as desired).  Idea
	   for this hook came from James FitzGibbon.

       "$self-&gtparent_read_hook()"
	   This hook occurs any time that the parent reads information from
	   the child.  The line from the child is sent as an argument.

       "$self-&gtchild_is_talking_hook()"
	   This hook occurs if child_communication is true and the child has
	   written to $self-&gt{server}-&gt{parent_sock}.  The first argument will
	   be the open socket to the child.

BUGS
       Tests don't seem to work on Win32.  Any ideas or patches would be
       welcome.
