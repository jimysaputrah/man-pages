NAME
       SSL_free - free an allocated SSL structure

SYNOPSIS
	#include <openssl/ssl.h>

	void SSL_free(SSL *ssl);

DESCRIPTION
       SSL_free() decrements the reference count of ssl, and removes the SSL
       structure pointed to by ssl and frees up the allocated memory if the
       reference count has reached 0.

NOTES
       SSL_free() also calls the free()ing procedures for indirectly affected
       items, if applicable: the buffering BIO, the read and write BIOs,
       cipher lists specially created for this ssl, the SSL_SESSION.  Do not
       explicitly free these indirectly freed up items before or after calling
       SSL_free(), as trying to free things twice may lead to program failure.

       The ssl session has reference counts from two users: the SSL object,
       for which the reference count is removed by SSL_free() and the internal
       session cache. If the session is considered bad, because
       SSL_shutdown(3) was not called for the connection and
       SSL_set_shutdown(3) was not used to set the SSL_SENT_SHUTDOWN state,
       the session will also be removed from the session cache as required by
       RFC2246.

RETURN VALUES
       SSL_free() does not provide diagnostic information.

       SSL_new(3), SSL_clear(3), SSL_shutdown(3), SSL_set_shutdown(3), ssl(3)
