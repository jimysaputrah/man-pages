PTHREAD_EXIT(3) 	 BSD Library Functions Manual	       PTHREAD_EXIT(3)

NAME
     pthread_exit -- terminate the calling thread

SYNOPSIS
     #include <pthread.h>

     void
     pthread_exit(void *value_ptr);

DESCRIPTION
     The pthread_exit() function terminates the calling thread and makes the
     value value_ptr available to any successful join with the terminating
     thread.  Any cancellation cleanup handlers that have been pushed and are
     not yet popped are popped in the reverse order that they were pushed and
     then executed.  After all cancellation handlers have been executed, if
     the thread has any thread-specific data, appropriate destructor functions
     are called in an unspecified order.  Thread termination does not release
     any application visible process resources, including, but not limited to,
     mutexes and file descriptors, nor does it perform any process level
     cleanup actions, including, but not limited to, calling atexit() routines
     that may exist.

     An implicit call to pthread_exit() is made when a thread other than the
     thread in which main() was first invoked returns from the start routine
     that was used to create it. The function's return value serves as the
     thread's exit status.

     The behavior of pthread_exit() is undefined if called from a cancellation
     handler or destructor function that was invoked as the result of an
     implicit or explicit call to pthread_exit().

     After a thread has terminated, the result of access to local (auto) vari-
     ables of the thread is undefined.	Thus, references to local variables of
     the exiting thread should not be used for the pthread_exit() value_ptr
     parameter value.

     The process will exit with an exit status of 0 after the last thread has
     been terminated.  The behavior is as if the implementation called exit()
     with a zero argument at thread termination time.

RETURN VALUES
     The pthread_exit() function cannot return to its caller.

ERRORS
     None.

STANDARDS
     pthread_exit() conforms to ISO/IEC 9945-1:1996 (``POSIX.1'').
