DESCRIPTION
       These procedures provide a platform and compiler independent  interface
       for  memory  allocation.   Programs  that need to transfer ownership of
       memory blocks between Tcl and other modules should use  these  routines
       rather  than  the native malloc() and free() routines provided by the C
       run-time library.

       Tcl_Alloc returns a pointer to a block of at least size bytes  suitably
       aligned for any use.

       Tcl_Free makes the space referred to by ptr available for further allo-
       cation.

       Tcl_Realloc changes the size of the block pointed to  by  ptr  to  size
       bytes  and  returns  a  pointer to the new block.  The contents will be
       unchanged up to the lesser of the new  and  old	sizes.	 The  returned
       location may be different from ptr.  If ptr is NULL, this is equivalent
       to calling Tcl_Alloc with just the size argument.

       Tcl_AttemptAlloc and Tcl_AttemptRealloc are identical  in  function  to
       Tcl_Alloc   and	 Tcl_Realloc,	except	 that	Tcl_AttemptAlloc   and
       Tcl_AttemptRealloc will not cause the Tcl interpreter to panic  if  the
       memory allocation fails.  If the allocation fails, these functions will
       return NULL.  Note that on some platforms, but not all,	attempting  to
       allocate  a  zero-sized block of memory will also cause these functions
       to return NULL.

       The  procedures	ckalloc,  ckfree,   ckrealloc,	 attemptckalloc,   and
       attemptckrealloc  are  implemented  as macros.  Normally, they are syn-
       onyms for the corresponding procedures documented on this  page.   When
       Tcl  and  all  modules  calling	Tcl  are  compiled  with TCL_MEM_DEBUG
       defined, however, these macros are redefined to	be  special  debugging
       versions of these procedures.  To support Tcl's memory debugging within
       a module, use the macros rather than direct calls to Tcl_Alloc, etc.
