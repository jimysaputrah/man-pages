AUDIT(8)		  BSD System Manager's Manual		      AUDIT(8)

NAME
     audit -- audit management utility

SYNOPSIS
     audit -e | -i | -n | -s | -t

DESCRIPTION
     The audit utility controls the state of the audit system.	One of the
     following flags is required as an argument to audit:

     -e      Forces the audit system to immediately remove audit log files
	     that meet the expiration criteria specified in the audit control
	     file without doing a log rotation.

     -i      Initializes and starts auditing.  This option is currently for
	     Mac OS X only and requires auditd(8) to be configured to run
	     under launchd(8).

     -n      Forces the audit system to close the existing audit log file and
	     rotate to a new log file in a location specified in the audit
	     control file.  Also, audit log files that meet the expiration
	     criteria specified in the audit control file will be removed.

     -s      Specifies that the audit system should [re]synchronize its con-
	     figuration from the audit control file.  A new log file will be
	     created.

     -t      Specifies that the audit system should terminate.	Log files are
	     closed and renamed to indicate the time of the shutdown.

NOTES
     The auditd(8) daemon must already be running.  Optionally, it can be con-
     figured to be started on-demand by launchd(8) (Mac OS X only).  The audit
     utility requires audit administrator privileges for successful operation.

FILES
     /etc/security/audit_control  Audit policy file used to configure the
				  auditing system.
