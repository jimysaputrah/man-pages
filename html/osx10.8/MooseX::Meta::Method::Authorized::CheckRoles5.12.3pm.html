NAME
       MooseX::Meta::Method::Authorized::CheckRoles - Check roles of the user

DESCRIPTION
       This verifier module will check if the user has any of the roles
       defined in the "requires" attribute of the method. To get the user this
       module will call "user" on the object which is the invocant for this
       method, to get the roles it will call "roles" on the user object.

METHODS
       authorized_do($method, $code, @_)
	   This is the method that does the actual verification. It only
	   invokes the coderef after checking if the user has any of the
	   required roles. It will die otherwise with a string like:

	     Access Denied. User "johndoe" does not have any of the required
	     roles ("foo") required to invoke method "bla" on class
	     "My::ClassTest1". User roles are: ("foo","bar","baz")

	   It will only show the user id if the user implements the method
	   "id".
