NAME
       Math::BigInt::FastCalc - Math::BigInt::Calc with some XS for more speed

SYNOPSIS
       Provides support for big integer calculations. Not intended to be used
       by other modules. Other modules which sport the same functions can also
       be used to support Math::BigInt, like Math::BigInt::GMP or
       Math::BigInt::Pari.

DESCRIPTION
       In order to allow for multiple big integer libraries, Math::BigInt was
       rewritten to use library modules for core math routines. Any module
       which follows the same API as this can be used instead by using the
       following:

	       use Math::BigInt lib =&gt 'libname';

       'libname' is either the long name ('Math::BigInt::Pari'), or only the
       short version like 'Pari'. To use this library:

	       use Math::BigInt lib =&gt 'FastCalc';

       Note that from Math::BigInt v1.76 onwards, FastCalc will be loaded
       automatically, if possible.

STORAGE
       FastCalc works exactly like Calc, in stores the numbers in decimal
       form, chopped into parts.

METHODS
       The following functions are now implemented in FastCalc.xs:

	       _is_odd	       _is_even        _is_one	       _is_zero
	       _is_two	       _is_ten
	       _zero	       _one	       _two	       _ten
	       _acmp	       _len	       _num
	       _inc	       _dec
	       __strip_zeros   _copy

AUTHORS
       Original math code by Mark Biggar, rewritten by Tels
       &lthttp://bloodgate.com/&gt in late 2000.  Seperated from BigInt and shaped
       API with the help of John Peacock.  Fixed, sped-up and enhanced by Tels
       http://bloodgate.com 2001-2003.	Further streamlining (api_version 1
       etc.) by Tels 2004-2007.
