GETTTYENT(3)		 BSD Library Functions Manual		  GETTTYENT(3)

NAME
     getttyent, getttynam, setttyent, endttyent -- get ttys file entry

LIBRARY
     Standard C Library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
     #include &ltttyent.h&gt

     struct ttyent *
     getttyent(void);

     struct ttyent *
     getttynam(const char *name);

     int
     setttyent(void);

     int
     endttyent(void);

DESCRIPTION
     The getttyent(), and getttynam() functions each return a pointer to an
     object, with the following structure, containing the broken-out fields of
     a line from the tty description file.

     struct ttyent {
	     char    *ty_name;	     /* terminal device name */
	     char    *ty_getty;      /* command to execute, usually getty */
	     char    *ty_type;	     /* terminal type for termcap */
     #define TTY_ON	     0x01    /* enable logins (start ty_getty program) */
     #define TTY_SECURE      0x02    /* allow uid of 0 to login */
     #define TTY_DIALUP      0x04    /* is a dialup tty */
     #define TTY_NETWORK     0x08    /* is a network tty */
	     int     ty_status;      /* status flags */
	     char    *ty_window;     /* command to start up window manager */
	     char    *ty_comment;    /* comment field */
	     char    *ty_group;      /* tty group name */
     };

     The fields are as follows:

     ty_name	 The name of the character-special file.

     ty_getty	 The name of the command invoked by init(8) to initialize tty
		 line characteristics.

     ty_type	 The name of the default terminal type connected to this tty
		 line.

     ty_status	 A mask of bit fields which indicate various actions allowed
		 on this tty line.  The possible flags are as follows:

		 TTY_ON       Enables logins (i.e., init(8) will start the
			      command referenced by ty_getty on this entry).

		 TTY_SECURE   Allow users with a uid of 0 to login on this
			      terminal.

		 TTY_DIALUP   Identifies a tty as a dialin line.

		 TTY_NETWORK  Identifies a tty used for network connections.

     ty_window	 The command to execute for a window system associated with
		 the line.

     ty_group	 A group name to which the tty belongs.  If no group is speci-
		 fied in the ttys description file, then the tty is placed in
		 an anonymous group called "none".

     ty_comment  Any trailing comment field, with any leading hash marks
		 (``#'') or whitespace removed.

     If any of the fields pointing to character strings are unspecified, they
     are returned as null pointers.  The field ty_status will be zero if no
     flag values are specified.

     See ttys(5) for a more complete discussion of the meaning and usage of
     the fields.

     The getttyent() function reads the next line from the ttys file, opening
     the file if necessary.  The setttyent() function rewinds the file if
     open, or opens the file if it is unopened.  The endttyent() function
     closes any open files.

     The getttynam() function searches from the beginning of the file until a
     matching name is found (or until EOF is encountered).

RETURN VALUES
     The routines getttyent() and getttynam() return a null pointer on EOF or
     error.  The setttyent() function and endttyent() return 0 on failure and
     1 on success.

FILES
     /etc/ttys

SEE ALSO
     login(1), ttyslot(3), gettytab(5), termcap(5), ttys(5), getty(8), init(8)

HISTORY
     The getttyent(), getttynam(), setttyent(), and endttyent() functions
     appeared in 4.3BSD.

BUGS
     These functions use static data storage; if the data is needed for future
     use, it should be copied before any subsequent calls overwrite it.
