NAME
       glStencilMaskSeparate - control the front and/or back writing of
       individual bits in the stencil planes

C SPECIFICATION
       void glStencilMaskSeparate(GLenum face, GLuint mask);

PARAMETERS
       face
	   Specifies whether the front and/or back stencil writemask is
	   updated. Three symbolic constants are valid: GL_FRONT, GL_BACK, and
	   GL_FRONT_AND_BACK.

       mask
	   Specifies a bit mask to enable and disable writing of individual
	   bits in the stencil planes. Initially, the mask is all 1's.

DESCRIPTION
       glStencilMaskSeparate controls the writing of individual bits in the
       stencil planes. The least significant n bits of mask, where n is the
       number of bits in the stencil buffer, specify a mask. Where a 1 appears
       in the mask, it's possible to write to the corresponding bit in the
       stencil buffer. Where a 0 appears, the corresponding bit is
       write-protected. Initially, all bits are enabled for writing.

       There can be two separate mask writemasks; one affects back-facing
       polygons, and the other affects front-facing polygons as well as other
       non-polygon primitives.	glStencilMask() sets both front and back
       stencil writemasks to the same values, as if glStencilMaskSeparate()
       were called with face set to GL_FRONT_AND_BACK.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if face is not one of the accepted tokens.

ASSOCIATED GETS
       glGet() with argument GL_STENCIL_WRITEMASK, GL_STENCIL_BACK_WRITEMASK,
       or GL_STENCIL_BITS
