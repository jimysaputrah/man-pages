Tk_CreateWindow(3)	     Tk Library Procedures	    Tk_CreateWindow(3)



______________________________________________________________________________

NAME
       Tk_CreateWindow, Tk_CreateWindowFromPath, Tk_DestroyWindow, Tk_MakeWin-
       dowExist - create or delete window

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lttk.h&gt

       Tk_Window
       Tk_CreateWindow(interp, parent, name, topLevScreen)

       Tk_Window
       Tk_CreateAnonymousWindow(interp, parent, topLevScreen)

       Tk_Window
       Tk_CreateWindowFromPath(interp, tkwin, pathName, topLevScreen)

       Tk_DestroyWindow(tkwin)

       Tk_MakeWindowExist(tkwin)

ARGUMENTS
       Tcl_Interp *interp (out) 	      Tcl interpreter to use for error
					      reporting.   If no error occurs,
					      then *interp is not modified.

       Tk_Window parent (in)		      Token for the window that is  to
					      serve  as  the logical parent of
					      the new window.

       const char *name (in)		      Name to  use  for  this  window.
					      Must  be	unique among all chil-
					      dren of the same parent.

       const char *topLevScreen (in)	      Has same format  as  screenName.
					      If NULL, then new window is cre-
					      ated as an internal window.   If
					      non-NULL,  new window is created
					      as a top-level window on	screen
					      topLevScreen.   If  topLevScreen
					      is an empty string ("") then new
					      window  is  created as top-level
					      window of parent's screen.

       Tk_Window tkwin (in)		      Token for window.

       const char *pathName (in)	      Name of new window, specified as
					      path   name  within  application
					      (e.g. .a.b.c).

DESCRIPTION
       The procedures Tk_CreateWindow, Tk_CreateAnonymousWindow,  and  Tk_Cre-
       ateWindowFromPath  are  used  to create new windows for use in Tk-based
       applications.  Each of the procedures returns a token that can be  used
       to manipulate the window in other calls to the Tk library.  If the win-
       dow could not be  created  successfully,  then  NULL  is  returned  and
       interp-&gtresult is modified to hold an error message.

       Tk  supports two different kinds of windows:  internal windows and top-
       level windows.  An internal window is an interior window of a Tk appli-
       cation,	such as a scrollbar or menu bar or button.  A top-level window
       is one that is created as a child of a  screen's  root  window,	rather
       than  as an interior window, but which is logically part of some exist-
       ing main window.  Examples of top-level windows are  pop-up  menus  and
       dialog boxes.

       New  windows  may  be  created  by  calling  Tk_CreateWindow.   If  the
       topLevScreen argument is NULL, then the new window will be an  internal
       window.	 If  topLevScreen  is  non-NULL, then the new window will be a
       top-level window: topLevScreen indicates the name of a screen  and  the
       new  window  will  be  created  as  a  child  of  the  root  window  of
       topLevScreen.  In either case Tk will consider the new window to be the
       logical	child  of parent: the new window's path name will reflect this
       fact, options may be specified for the new window  under  this  assump-
       tion,  and  so on.  The only difference is that new X window for a top-
       level window will not be a child of parent's X window.  For example,  a
       pull-down  menu's parent would be the button-like window used to invoke
       it, which would in turn be a child of the menu bar  window.   A	dialog
       box might have the application's main window as its parent.

       Tk_CreateAnonymousWindow  differs  from Tk_CreateWindow in that it cre-
       ates an unnamed window.	This window will be manipulable only  using  C
       interfaces, and will not be visible to Tcl scripts.  Both interior win-
       dows and top-level windows may be created  with	Tk_CreateAnonymousWin-
       dow.

       Tk_CreateWindowFromPath	offers an alternate way of specifying new win-
       dows.  In Tk_CreateWindowFromPath the new window is  specified  with  a
       token  for  any	window	in the target application (tkwin), plus a path
       name for the new window.  It produces the same effect as  Tk_CreateWin-
       dow  and  allows  both  top-level  and  internal windows to be created,
       depending on the value of  topLevScreen.   In  calls  to  Tk_CreateWin-
       dowFromPath, as in calls to Tk_CreateWindow, the parent of the new win-
       dow must exist at the time of the call, but the	new  window  must  not
       already exist.

       The  window  creation procedures do not actually issue the command to X
       to create a window.  Instead, they create a local data structure  asso-
       ciated  with  the  window  and defer the creation of the X window.  The
       window will actually be created by  the	first  call  to  Tk_MapWindow.
       Deferred  window creation allows various aspects of the window (such as
       its size, background color, etc.) to be	modified  after  its  creation
       without	incurring  any	overhead  in the X server.  When the window is
       finally mapped all of the window attributes can be set  while  creating
       the window.

       The  value  returned  by a window-creation procedure is not the X token
       for the window (it cannot be, since X has not been asked to create  the
       window  yet).  Instead, it is a token for Tk's local data structure for
       the window.  Most of the Tk library procedures take  Tk_Window  tokens,
       rather  than  X	identifiers.   The  actual  X window identifier can be
       retrieved from the local data structure using  the  Tk_WindowId	macro;
       see the manual entry for Tk_WindowId for details.

       Tk_DestroyWindow  deletes  a window and all the data structures associ-
       ated with it, including any event handlers created with	Tk_CreateEven-
       tHandler.   In  addition,  Tk_DestroyWindow will delete any children of
       tkwin recursively (where children are defined in the Tk sense, consist-
       ing  of all windows that were created with the given window as parent).
       If tkwin is an internal	window,  then  event  handlers	interested  in
       destroy	events	are  invoked  immediately.  If tkwin is a top-level or
       main window, then the event handlers will be invoked later, after X has
       seen the request and returned an event for it.

       If  a  window  has been created but has not been mapped, so no X window
       exists, it is possible to force the creation of the X window by calling
       Tk_MakeWindowExist.   This procedure issues the X commands to instanti-
       ate the window given by tkwin.
