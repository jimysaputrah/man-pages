UNGETWC(3)		 BSD Library Functions Manual		    UNGETWC(3)

NAME
     ungetwc, ungetwc_l -- un-get wide character from input stream

LIBRARY
     Standard C Library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
     #include &ltstdio.h&gt
     #include &ltwchar.h&gt

     wint_t
     ungetwc(wint_t wc, FILE *stream);

     #include &ltstdio.h&gt
     #include &ltwchar.h&gt
     #include &ltxlocale.h&gt

     wint_t
     ungetwc_l(wint_t wc, FILE *stream, locale_t loc);

DESCRIPTION
     The ungetwc() function pushes the wide character wc (converted to an
     wchar_t) back onto the input stream pointed to by stream.	The pushed-
     backed wide characters will be returned (in reverse order) by subsequent
     reads on the stream.  A successful intervening call to one of the file
     positioning functions fseek(3), fsetpos(3), or rewind(3), using the same
     stream, will discard the pushed-back wide characters.

     Only one wide character of push-back is guaranteed, but as long as there
     is sufficient memory, an effectively infinite amount of push-back is
     allowed.

     If a character is successfully pushed-back, the end-of-file indicator for
     the stream is cleared.

     Although the ungetwc() function uses the current locale, the ungetwc_l()
     function may be passed a locale directly. See xlocale(3) for more infor-
     mation.

RETURN VALUES
     The ungetwc() function returns the wide character pushed-back after the
     conversion, or WEOF if the operation fails.  If the value of the argument
     c character equals WEOF, the operation will fail and the stream will
     remain unchanged.

SEE ALSO
     fseek(3), getwc(3), xlocale(3)

STANDARDS
     The ungetwc() function conforms to ISO/IEC 9899:1999 (``ISO C99'').
