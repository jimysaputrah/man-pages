Regexp::Common::URI::gUserrContributed Perl DocuRegexp::Common::URI::gopher(3)



NAME
       Regexp::Common::URI::gopher -- Returns a pattern for gopher URIs.

SYNOPSIS
	   use Regexp::Common qw /URI/;

	   while (&lt&gt) {
	       /$RE{URI}{gopher}/	and  print "Contains a gopher URI.\n";
	   }

DESCRIPTION
   $RE{URI}{gopher}{-notab}
       Gopher URIs are poorly defined. Originally, RFC 1738 defined gopher
       URIs, but they were later redefined in an internet draft. One that was
       expired in June 1997.

       The internet draft for gopher URIs defines them as follows:

	   "gopher:" "//" host [ ":" port ] "/" gopher-type selector
			       [ "%09" search [ "%09" gopherplus_string ]]

       Unfortunally, a selector is defined in such a way that characters may
       be escaped using the URI escape mechanism. This includes tabs, which
       escaped are %09. Hence, the syntax cannot distinguish between a URI
       that has both a selector and a search part, and an URI where the
       selector includes an escaped tab. (The text of the draft forbids tabs
       to be present in the selector though).

       $RE{URI}{gopher} follows the defined syntax. To disallow escaped tabs
       in the selector and search parts, use $RE{URI}{gopher}{-notab}.

       There are other differences between the text and the given syntax.
       According to the text, selector strings cannot have tabs, linefeeds or
       carriage returns in them. The text also allows the entire gopher-path,
       (the part after the slash following the hostport) to be empty; if this
       is empty the slash may be omitted as well. However, this isn't
       reflected in the syntax.

       Under "{-keep}", the following are returned:

       $1  The entire URI.

       $2  The scheme.

       $3  The host (name or address).

       $4  The port (if any).

       $5  The "gopher-path", the part after the / following the host and
	   port.

       $6  The gopher-type.

       $7  The selector. (When no "{-notab}" is used, this includes the search
	   and gopherplus_string, including the separating escaped tabs).

       $8  The search, if given. (Only when "{-notab}" is given).

       $9  The gopherplus_string, if given. (Only when "{-notab}" is given).
