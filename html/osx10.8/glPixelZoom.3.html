NAME
       glPixelZoom - specify the pixel zoom factors


C SPECIFICATION
       void glPixelZoom( GLfloat xfactor,
			 GLfloat yfactor )


PARAMETERS
       xfactor, yfactor Specify the x and y zoom factors for pixel write oper-
			ations.

DESCRIPTION
       glPixelZoom specifies values for the x and y zoom factors.  During  the
       execution of glDrawPixels or glCopyPixels, if (xr , yr ) is the current
       raster position, and a given element is in the mth row and  nth	column
       of  the pixel rectangle, then pixels whose centers are in the rectangle
       with corners at

			(xr + n * xfactor, yr + m * yfactor)

		     ( xr + (n+1) * xfactor, yr + (m+1)*yfactor)


       are candidates for replacement.	Any pixel whose  center  lies  on  the
       bottom or left edge of this rectangular region is also modified.

       Pixel  zoom  factors are not limited to positive values.  Negative zoom
       factors reflect the resulting image about the current raster  position.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_OPERATION  is  generated  if glPixelZoom is executed between
       the execution of glBegin and the corresponding execution of glEnd.

ASSOCIATED GETS
       glGet with argument GL_ZOOM_X
       glGet with argument GL_ZOOM_Y
