NAME
       DBD::Gofer::Policy::pedantic - The 'pedantic' policy for DBD::Gofer

SYNOPSIS
	 $dbh = DBI-&gtconnect("dbi:Gofer:transport=...;policy=pedantic", ...)

DESCRIPTION
       The "pedantic" policy tries to be as transparent as possible. To do
       this it makes round-trips to the server for almost every DBI method
       call.

       This is the best policy to use when first testing existing code with
       Gofer.  Once it's working well you should consider moving to the
       "classic" policy or defining your own policy class.

       Temporary docs: See the source code for list of policies and their
       defaults.

       In a future version the policies and their defaults will be defined in
       the pod and parsed out at load-time.
