NAME
       glFramebufferRenderbuffer - attach a renderbuffer as a logical buffer
       to the currently bound framebuffer object

C SPECIFICATION
       GLsync glFramebufferRenderbuffer(GLenum target, GLenum attachment,
					GLenum renderbuffertarget,
					GLuint renderbuffer);

PARAMETERS
       target
	   Specifies the framebuffer target.  target must be
	   GL_DRAW_FRAMEBUFFER, GL_READ_FRAMEBUFFER, or GL_FRAMEBUFFER.
	   GL_FRAMEBUFFER is equivalent to GL_DRAW_FRAMEBUFFER.

       attachment
	   Specifies the attachment point of the framebuffer.

       renderbuffertarget
	   Specifies the renderbuffer target and must be GL_RENDERBUFFER.

       renderbuffer
	   Specifies the name of an existing renderbuffer object of type
	   renderbuffertarget to attach.

DESCRIPTION
       glFramebufferRenderbuffer attaches a renderbuffer as one of the logical
       buffers of the currently bound framebuffer object.  renderbuffer is the
       name of the renderbuffer object to attach and must be either zero, or
       the name of an existing renderbuffer object of type renderbuffertarget.
       If renderbuffer is not zero and if glFramebufferRenderbuffer is
       successful, then the renderbuffer name renderbuffer will be used as the
       logical buffer identified by attachment of the framebuffer currently
       bound to target.

       The value of GL_FRAMEBUFFER_ATTACHMENT_OBJECT_TYPE for the specified
       attachment point is set to GL_RENDERBUFFER and the value of
       GL_FRAMEBUFFER_ATTACHMENT_OBJECT_NAME is set to renderbuffer. All other
       state values of the attachment point specified by attachment are set to
       their default values. No change is made to the state of the
       renderbuuffer object and any previous attachment to the attachment
       logical buffer of the framebuffer target is broken.

       Calling glFramebufferRenderbuffer with the renderbuffer name zero will
       detach the image, if any, identified by attachment, in the framebuffer
       currently bound to target. All state values of the attachment point
       specified by attachment in the object bound to target are set to their
       default values.

       Setting attachment to the value GL_DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT is a
       special case causing both the depth and stencil attachments of the
       framebuffer object to be set to renderbuffer, which should have the
       base internal format GL_DEPTH_STENCIL.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if target is not one of the accepted
       tokens.


       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if renderbuffertarget is not
       GL_RENDERBUFFER.


       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if zero is bound to target.
