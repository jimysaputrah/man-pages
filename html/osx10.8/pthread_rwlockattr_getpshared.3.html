NAME
     pthread_rwlockattr_getpshared -- get the process shared attribute

SYNOPSIS
     #include &ltpthread.h&gt

     int
     pthread_rwlockattr_getpshared(const pthread_rwlockattr_t *restrict attr,
	 int *restrict pshared);

DESCRIPTION
     The pthread_rwlockattr_getpshared() function is used to get the process-
     shared setting of a read/write lock attribute object.  The setting is
     returned via pshared, and may be one of two values:

     PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED   Any thread of any process that has access to the
			      memory where the read/write lock resides can
			      manipulate the lock.

     PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE  Only threads created within the same process as
			      the thread that initialized the read/write lock
			      can manipulate the lock.	This is the default
			      value.

RETURN VALUES
     If successful, the pthread_rwlockattr_getpshared() function will return
     zero.  Otherwise, an error number will be returned to indicate the error.

SEE ALSO
     pthread_rwlock_init(3), pthread_rwlockattr_init(3),
     pthread_rwlockattr_setpshared(3)

STANDARDS

     Version 2 of the Single UNIX Specification (``SUSv2'').

ERRORS
     pthread_rwlockattr_getpshared() may fail if:

     [EINVAL]		The value specified by attr is invalid.
