OPENPAM_READLINE(3)	 BSD Library Functions Manual	   OPENPAM_READLINE(3)

NAME
     openpam_readline -- read a line from a file

LIBRARY
     Pluggable Authentication Module Library (libpam, -lpam)

SYNOPSIS
     #include &ltsys/types.h&gt
     #include &ltsecurity/pam_appl.h&gt
     #include &ltsecurity/openpam.h&gt

     char *
     openpam_readline(FILE *f, int *lineno, size_t *lenp);

DESCRIPTION
     The openpam_readline function reads a line from a file, and returns it in
     a NUL-terminated buffer allocated with malloc(3).

     The openpam_readline function performs a certain amount of processing on
     the data it reads.  Comments (introduced by a hash sign) are stripped, as
     is leading and trailing whitespace.  Any amount of linear whitespace is
     collapsed to a single space.  Blank lines are ignored.  If a line ends in
     a backslash, the backslash is stripped and the next line is appended.

     If lineno is not NULL, the integer variable it points to is incremented
     every time a newline character is read.

     If lenp is not NULL, the length of the line (not including the terminat-
     ing NUL character) is stored in the variable it points to.

     The caller is responsible for releasing the returned buffer by passing it
     to free(3).

RETURN VALUES
     The openpam_readline function returns NULL on failure.

SEE ALSO
     free(3), malloc(3), pam(3)

STANDARDS
     The openpam_readline function is an OpenPAM extension.
