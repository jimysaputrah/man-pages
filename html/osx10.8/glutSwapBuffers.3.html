NAME
       glutSwapBuffers	-  swaps  the  buffers of the current window if double
       buffered.

SYNTAX
       #include <GLUT/glut.h>

       void glutSwapBuffers(void);

DESCRIPTION
       Performs a buffer swap on the layer in  use  for  the  current  window.
       Specifically,  glutSwapBuffers promotes the contents of the back buffer
       of the layer in use of the current window to become the contents of the
       front  buffer.  The  contents of the back buffer then become undefined.
       The update typically takes place during the  vertical  retrace  of  the
       monitor, rather than immediately after glutSwapBuffers is called.

       An implicit glFlush is done by glutSwapBuffers before it returns.  Sub-
       sequent	OpenGL	commands  can  be  issued  immediately	after  calling
       glutSwapBuffers, but are not executed until the buffer exchange is com-
       pleted.

       If the layer in use is not  double  buffered,  glutSwapBuffers  has  no
       effect.
