ABORT(3)		 BSD Library Functions Manual		      ABORT(3)

NAME
     abort -- cause abnormal program termination

LIBRARY
     Standard C Library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <stdlib.h>

     void
     abort(void);

DESCRIPTION
     The abort() function causes abnormal program termination to occur, unless
     the signal SIGABRT is being caught and the signal handler does not
     return.

     Any open streams are flushed and closed.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
     The abort() function is thread-safe.  It is unknown if it is async-can-
     cel-safe.

     The abort() function causes a report to be generated by Crash Reporter.
     If you wish to terminate without generating a crash report, use exit(3)
     instead.

RETURN VALUES
     The abort() function never returns.

SEE ALSO
     sigaction(2), exit(3)

STANDARDS
     The abort() function conforms to ISO/IEC 9945-1:1990 (``POSIX.1'').  The
     abort() function also conforms to ISO/IEC 9899:1999 (``ISO C99'') with
     the implementation specific details as noted above.
