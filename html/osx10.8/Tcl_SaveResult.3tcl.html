       Tcl_SaveInterpState(interp, status)

       int

       Tcl_DiscardResult(savedPtr)

ARGUMENTS
       Tcl_Interp *interp (in)		      Interpreter   for   which  state
					      should be saved.

       int status (in)			      Return code  value  to  save  as
					      part of interpreter state.

       Tcl_InterpState state (in)	      Saved state token to be restored
					      or discarded.

       Tcl_SavedResult *savedPtr (in)	      Pointer to location where inter-
					      preter result should be saved or
					      restored.

DESCRIPTION
       These routines allows a C procedure to take a snapshot of  the  current |
       state  of  an  interpreter  so  that it can be restored after a call to |
       Tcl_Eval or some other routine that  modifies  the  interpreter	state. |
       There are two triplets of routines meant to work together.	       |

       The first triplet stores the snapshot of interpreter state in an opaque |
       token returned by Tcl_SaveInterpState.  That token value  may  then  be |
       passed back to one of Tcl_RestoreInterpState or Tcl_DiscardInterpState, |
       depending on whether the interp state is to be restored.   So  long  as |
       one  of the latter two routines is called, Tcl will take care of memory |
       management.							       |

       The second triplet stores the snapshot of only the  interpreter	result |
       (not its complete state) in memory allocated by the caller.  These rou- |
       tines are passed a pointer to a Tcl_SavedResult structure that is  used |
       to  store  enough  information to restore the interpreter result.  This |
       structure can be allocated on  the  stack  of  the  calling  procedure. |
       These  routines	do  not save the state of any error information in the |
       interpreter (e.g. the -errorcode or -errorinfo return options, when  an |
       error is in progress).						       |

       Because	the  routines Tcl_SaveInterpState, Tcl_RestoreInterpState, and |
       Tcl_DiscardInterpState perform a superset of the functions provided  by |
       the  other routines, any new code should only make use of the more pow- |
       erful routines.	The older, weaker routines Tcl_SaveResult, Tcl_Restor- |
       eResult,  and  Tcl_DiscardResult continue to exist only for the sake of |
       existing programs that may already be using them.		       |

       Tcl_SaveInterpState takes a snapshot of those portions  of  interpreter |
       state  that make up the full result of script evaluation.  This include |
       the interpreter result, the return code (passed in as the status  argu- |
       ment,  and any return options, including -errorinfo and -errorcode when |
       an error is in progress.  This snapshot is returned as an opaque  token |
       of  type  Tcl_InterpState.   The  call  to Tcl_SaveInterpState does not |
       itself change the state of the interpreter.  Unlike Tcl_SaveResult,  it |
       does not reset the interpreter.					       |

       Tcl_RestoreInterpState	accepts  a  Tcl_InterpState  token  previously |
       returned by Tcl_SaveInterpState and restores the state of the interp to |
       the  state  held  in that snapshot.  The return value of Tcl_RestoreIn- |
       terpState is the status value originally passed to  Tcl_SaveInterpState |
       when the snapshot token was created.				       |

       Tcl_DiscardInterpState  is  called  to  release a Tcl_InterpState token |
       previously returned by Tcl_SaveInterpState when that snapshot is not to |
       be restored to an interp.					       |

       The  Tcl_InterpState token returned by Tcl_SaveInterpState must eventu- |
       ally be passed to either Tcl_RestoreInterpState	or  Tcl_DiscardInterp- |
       State to avoid a memory leak.  Once the Tcl_InterpState token is passed |
       to one of them, the token is no longer valid and  should  not  be  used |
       anymore.

       Tcl_SaveResult  moves  the string and object results of interp into the
       location specified by statePtr.	Tcl_SaveResult clears the  result  for
       interp and leaves the result in its normal empty initialized state.

       Tcl_RestoreResult  moves  the  string  and object results from statePtr
       back into interp.  Any result or error that was already in  the	inter-
       preter will be cleared.	The statePtr is left in an uninitialized state
       and cannot be used until another call to Tcl_SaveResult.

       Tcl_DiscardResult  releases  the  saved	interpreter  state  stored  at
       statePtr.   The	state  structure is left in an uninitialized state and
       cannot be used until another call to Tcl_SaveResult.

       Once Tcl_SaveResult is called to save the  interpreter  result,	either
       Tcl_RestoreResult or Tcl_DiscardResult must be called to properly clean
       up the memory associated with the saved state.
