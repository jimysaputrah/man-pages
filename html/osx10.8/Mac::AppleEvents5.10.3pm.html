	      $AppleEvent{"aevt", "odoc"} = \&OpenDocument;

       %SysAppleEvent
	   An arrary of system-wide event handlers.

   AEDesc
       AEDesc is a Perl package that encapsulates an Apple Event Descriptor.
       It uses the OO methods of Perl5 to make building and parsing data
       structures easier.

       new TYPE, HANDLE
       new TYPE, DATA
       new TYPE
       new Create a new Apple event descriptor.  Sets the type and data to
	   TYPE (default is 'null'), and HANDLE or DATA (default is empty).

		   $desc = new AEDesc("aevt", $event);

       type TYPE
       type
	   Return the type from the AEDesc structure.  If TYPE is present,
	   make it the new type.

       data HANDLE
       data
	   Return the data from the AEDesc structure. If HANDLE is present,
	   make it the new data.

	   Warning: If using Mac OS X, you must dispose of the result on your
	   own.  This is because in Mac OS, we returned the handle from the
	   AEDesc itself, but now we must return a copy.  So in Mac OS we
	   could do:

		   print $desc->data->get;

	   Now we must do:

		   my $handle = $desc->data;
		   print $handle->get;
		   $handle->dispose;

	   Normally, you don't want to call "data" directly anyway, and you
	   would use "get" instead.

       get Return the data of the AEDesc structure in a smartly unpacked way.

       dispose
	   Dispose the AEDesc.

   AEKeyDesc
       AEKeyDesc is a Perl package that encapsulates an Apple event keyword.
       It uses the OO methods of Perl5 to make building and parsing data
       structures easier.

       new KEY, TYPE, HANDLE
       new KEY, TYPE, DATA
       new KEY, TYPE
       new KEY
       new Creates a new Apple event keyword descriptor.  Sets the keyword,
	   type and data to KEY (default is zero), TYPE (default is 'null'),
	   and HANDLE or DATA (default is empty).

       key KEY
       key Return the keyword of the AEKeyDesc structure.  If KEY is present,
	   make it the new keyword.

       type TYPE
       type
	   Return the type from the AEKeyDesc structure.  If TYPE is present,
	   make it the new type.

       data HANDLE
       data
	   Return the data from the AEKeyDesc structure. If HANDLE is present,
	   make it the new data.

       get Return the contents in a smartly unpacked way.

       dispose
	   Dispose the underlying AEDesc.

   Raw AppleEvent Interface
       AECreateDesc TYPE, DATA
	   The AECreateDesc function creates a new descriptor record that
	   incorporates the specified data.

       AECoerce TYPE, DATA, NEWTYPE
       AECoerceDesc DESC, NEWTYPE
	   The AECoerceDesc function attempts to create a new descriptor
	   record by coercing the specified descriptor record. AECoerce
	   attempts the same with a Perl data string.

       AEDisposeDesc DESC
	   Deallocate the memory used by a descriptor record.

		   if ( !AEDisposeDesc($desc) ) {
			   # error occurred
		   }

       AEDuplicateDesc DESC
	   Creates a new descriptor record by copying the descriptor record
	   from the parameter $DESC.

		   $newDesc = AEDuplicateDesc($desc);
		   if ( defined $newDesc ) {
			   # do something productive
		   }

       AECreateList FACTOR, BOOL
	   The AECreateList function creates an empty descriptor list (BOOL is
	   0), or AE record (BOOL is nonzero). FACTOR contains the common
	   prefix for each descriptor or is empty.

		   $list = AECreateList("", 0);
		   if ( defined $list ) {
			   # do something productive
		   }

       AECountItems DESCLIST
	   Count the number of descriptor records in any descriptor list. The
	   result is "undef" if the list is invalid.

       AEPut DESCLIST, INDEX, TYPE, HANDLE
       AEPutDesc DESCLIST, INDEX, DESC
	   Add a descriptor record to any descriptor list. AEPut will
	   manufacture the record to add it to the list.  Return zero if an
	   error was detected.

       AEPutKey DESCLIST, KEY, TYPE, HANDLE
       AEPutKeyDesc DESCLIST, KEY, DESC
	   Add a descriptor record and a keyword to an AE record. AEPutKey
	   will manufacture the record to add it to the AE record.  Return
	   zero if an error was detected.

       AEGetNthDesc DESCLIST, INDEX [, TYPE]
	   The AEGetNthDesc function returns a specified descriptor record
	   from a specified descriptor list. The result is an AEDesc object
	   and the keyword from a keyword specified list.

		   ($Desc, $Key) = AEGetNthDesc($DescList, $i);
		   if ( defined $Desc ) {
			   # do something productive
		   }

       AEGetKeyDesc DESCLIST, KEY [, TYPE]
	   The AEGetKeyDesc function returns a keyword-specified descriptor
	   record from a specified descriptor record.	  The result is an
	   AEDesc object.

       AEDeleteItem DESCLIST, INDEX
	   Delete a descriptor record from a descriptor list. All subsequent
	   descriptor records will then move up one place.

       AEPutParam EVENT, KEY, TYPE, HANDLE
       AEPutParamDesc EVENT, KEY, DESC
	   Add a descriptor record and a keyword to an Apple event as an Apple
	   event parameter. AEPutParam creates the descriptor record.

       AEGetParamDesc EVENT, KEY [, TYPE]
	   The AEGetParamDesc function returns the descriptor record for a
	   specified Apple event parameter, which it attempts to coerce to the
	   descriptor type specified by TYPE (default is no coercion).

       AEDeleteParam EVENT, KEY
	   Delete an Apple event parameter.  Return zero if an error was
	   detected.

       AEGetAttributeDesc EVENT, KEY, TYPE
	   The AEGetAttributeDesc function returns the descriptor record for
	   the Apple event attribute with the specified keyword.

       AEPutAttribute EVENT, KEY, TYPE, HANDLE
       AEPutAttributeDesc EVENT, KEY, DESC
	   The AEPutAttributeDesc function takes a descriptor record and a
	   keyword and adds them to an Apple event as an attribute.
	   AEPutAttribute creates the record from TYPE and HANDLE.  Return
	   zero if an error was detected.

       AECreateAppleEvent CLASS, EVENTID, DESC [, RETURNID [, TRANSACTIONID ]
       ]
	   The AECreateAppleEvent function creates an Apple event and returns
	   it.	TRANSACTIONID defaults to zero.  RETURNID defaults to
	   kAutoGenerateReturnID.

       AESend EVENT, SENDMODE [, SENDPRIORITY [, TIMEOUT ] ]
	   Send the Apple Event EVENT.	TIMEOUT defaults to kAEDefaultTimeout.
	   SENDPRIORITY defaults to kAENormalPriority.	Returns the reply if
	   SENDMODE was kAEWaitReply.

       AEResetTimer REPLY
	   The Apple Event Manager for the server application uses the default
	   reply to send a Reset Timer event to the client application; the
	   Apple Event Manager for the client application's computer
	   intercepts this Apple event and resets the client application's
	   timer for the Apple event.

       AESuspendTheCurrentEvent EVENT
	   After a server application makes a successful call to the
	   AESuspendTheCurrentEvent function, it is no longer required to
	   return a result or a reply for the Apple event that was being
	   handled. The result is zero if no error was detected.

       AEResumeTheCurrentEvent EVENT [, FLAGS, REFCON]
	   The Apple Event Manager resumes handling the specified Apple event
	   using the handler specified in the FLAGS parameter, if any. If
	   FLAGS and REFCON are missing, AEResumeTheCurrentEvent simply
	   informs the Apple Event Manager that the specified event has been
	   handled.

       AEGetTheCurrentEvent
	   Get the Apple event that is currently being handled.

       AESetTheCurrentEvent EVENT
	   There is usually no reason for your application to use the
	   AESetTheCurrentEvent function.

       AEGetInteractionAllowed
	   The AEGetInteractionAllowed function returns a value that indicates
	   the user interaction preferences for responding to an Apple event.
	   The result is "undef" if an error was detected.

       AESetInteractionAllowed LEVEL
	   The AESetInteractionAllowed function sets the user interaction
	   level for a server application's response to an Apple event. The
	   result is zero if no error was detected.

       AEInstallEventHandler CLASS, EVENTID, HANDLER, HANDLERREFCON [, SYSTEM]
	   The AEInstallEventHandler function creates an entry in the Apple
	   event dispatch table. You must supply parameters that specify the
	   event class, the event ID, the address of the handler that handles
	   Apple events of the specified event class and event ID, and whether
	   the handler is to be added to the system Apple event dispatch table
	   or your application's Apple event dispatch table. You can also
	   specify a reference constant that the Apple Event Manager passes to
	   your handler whenever your handler processes an Apple event.

		   if (!AEInstallEventHandler(kCoreEventClass, kAEOpenDocuments, 'OpenDocument', 0) ) {
			   # an error occurred.
		   }

	   A much more uniform (and Perl-ish) method is available using the
	   hash arrays %AppleEvent and %SysAppleEvent to bind handlers to
	   event types.

		   $AppleEvent{kCoreEventClass, kAEOpenDocuments} = 'OpenDocument';
		   ...
		   delete $AppleEvent{kCoreEventClass, kAEOpenDocuments};

       AERemoveEventHandler CLASS, EVENTID [, SYSTEM]
	   The AERemoveEventHandler function removes the Apple event dispatch
	   table entry you specify in the parameters CLASS, EVENTID, and
	   SYSTEM.

       AEGetEventHandler CLASS, EVENTID [, SYSTEM]
	   The AEGetEventHandler function returns the handler and
	   handlerrefcon for the specified class and event.

		   ($proc, $refcon) = AEGetEventHandler("aevt", "oapp");

       AEManagerInfo KEY
	   Obtain information about the version of the Apple Event Manager
	   currently available or the number of processes that are currently
	   recording Apple events.  The result is "undef" if an error
	   occurred.

   AEGizmos Build/Print
       The Apple Event Gizmos were developed by Jens Peter Alfke at Apple as a
       vastly speeded up AE library. Consult the AEGizmo documentation for
       details of usage of the library. The Build/Print facility uses a
       formatting convention similar to scanf/printf to put things together.

       AEBuild FORMAT, PARM, ...
	   Build an AppleEvent descriptor using the format per the Gizmo
	   documentation and return it.

       AEBuildParameters EVENT, FORMAT, PARM, ...
	   Build parameters for an existing AppleEvent EVENT.

		   if (!AEBuildParameters($reply, $format, $parm1, $parm2) ) {
			   # an error occurred
		   }

       AEBuildAppleEvent CLASS, ID, ADDRESSTYPE, ADDRESS, RETURNID,
       TRANSACTIONID, FORMAT, PARMS, ...
	   Construct an AppleEvent from the format and parameters and return
	   it.

       AEPrint DESC
	   Return a string version of the descriptor record. The result is
	   "undef" if an error occurred.

   AEGizmos Subdescriptors
       The Apple Event Gizmos subdescriptor approach uses a dictionary method
       for extracting and constructing descriptors.  Parsing an Apple Event
       using the dictionary is very time efficient, and translating to and
       from the dictionary tables is quick and efficient.

       AEDescToSubDesc DESC
	   Mac OS only.

	   Translate DESC to a subdescriptor (dictionary entry).  Return the
	   subdescriptor.

       AEGetSubDescType SUBDESC
	   Mac OS only.

	   Return the type of the subdescriptor.

       AEGetSubDescBasicType SUBDESC
	   Mac OS only.

	   Return the basic type of the subdescriptor. Differs from
	   AEGetSubDescType in handling of coerced records.

       AESubDescIsListOrRecord SUBDESC
	   Mac OS only.

	   Return nonzero if the subdescriptor is a list or record.

       AEGetSubDescData SUBDESC
	   Mac OS only.

	   Returns the data of the subdescriptor.

       AESubDescToDesc SUBDESC, DESIREDTYPE
	   Mac OS only.

	   Translate the subdescriptor back to a descriptor of the desired
	   type.

       AECountSubDescItems SUBDESC
	   Mac OS only.

	   Counts the number of subdescriptor items.

       AEGetNthSubDesc SUBDESC,INDEX
	   Mac OS only.

	   Returns the item INDEX of the subdescriptor and its type if the
	   subdescriptor represented a record and not a list.

       AEGetKeySubDesc SUBDESC,KW
	   Mac OS only.

	   Returns the keyword indexed item from the subdescriptor.

   AEStream
       The Apple Event Gizmos streams approach uses a streaming model for
       building a sequence of descriptors.

       new AEStream
       AEStream::Open
	   Return a new AEStream.

       new AEStream(CLASS, ID, ADDRESSTYPE, ADDRESS [, RETURNID [,
       TRANSACTIONID ] ])
       AEStream::CreateEvent CLASS, ID, ADDRESSTYPE, ADDRESS, RETURNID,
       TRANSACTIONID
	   Create an AEStream attached to a new AppleEvent.

       new AEStream(EVENT)
       AEStream::OpenEvent EVENT
	   Opens the stream on the $EVENT.  Return "undef" if an error was
	   detected.

       Close
	   Return the descriptor corresponding to the stream, and close it
	   out.

		   $stream->Close;

       Abort STREAM
	   Abort the streaming process, and close it out.

		   $stream->Abort;

       OpenDesc TYPE
	   Start building a descriptor of the given type.  Return zero if an
	   error was detected.

		   if ( $stream->OpenDesc($type) ) {
			   # Long messy calculation that demonstrates the usefullness of this code
			   if ( $stream->WriteData($calculatedData)
			    &&	$stream->CloseDesc()
			   ){
				   # then, my work here is done
			   }
		   }

       WriteData DATA
	   Add data to the descriptor.

       CloseDesc
	   Finish up the descriptor.

       WriteDesc TYPE, DATA
	   Add the arbitrary data with the given type as a descriptor to the
	   stream.

       WriteAEDesc STREAM, AEDESC
	   Add an Apple Event descriptor to the stream.

       OpenList
	   Start building a list of AppleEvent descriptors in the stream.

       CloseList STREAM
	   Return zero if an error was detected.

		   if ( $stream->OpenList() ) {
			   for $desc (@descList) {
				   croak unless $stream->WriteAEDesc($desc);
			   }
			   die unless $stream->CloseList();
		   }

       OpenRecord [TYPE]
	   Start the process of building a record, to be coerced to the given
	   type.

       SetRecordType TYPE
	   Change the record type.

       CloseRecord STREAM
	   Close the record currently under construction.

		   if ( $stream->OpenRecord(typeAErecord) ) {
			   for $kdesc (@descList) {
				   die unless $stream->WriteKey($kdesc->key) and
						   $stream->WriteAEDesc($kdesc->desc);
			   }
			   die unless $stream->CloseRecord();
		   }

       WriteKeyDesc KEY, TYPE, DATA
	   Add the keyword descriptor to the stream.

       OpenKeyDesc KEY, TYPE
	   Open a descriptor with the given type and key.  Use CloseDesc() to
	   close it.

       WriteKey  KEY
	   Add the keyword to the immediately following descriptor.  Return
	   zero if an error was detected.

       OptionalParam KEY
	   Adds the keyword to the list of optional attributes.
