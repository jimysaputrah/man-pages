NAME
       git-shell - Restricted login shell for Git-only SSH access

SYNOPSIS
       git shell [-c &ltcommand&gt &ltargument&gt]


DESCRIPTION
       A login shell for SSH accounts to provide restricted Git access. When
       -c is given, the program executes &ltcommand&gt non-interactively;
       &ltcommand&gt can be one of git receive-pack, git upload-pack, git
       upload-archive, cvs server, or a command in COMMAND_DIR. The shell is
       started in interactive mode when no arguments are given; in this case,
       COMMAND_DIR must exist, and any of the executables in it can be
       invoked.

       cvs server is a special command which executes git-cvsserver.

       COMMAND_DIR is the path "$HOME/git-shell-commands". The user must have
       read and execute permissions to the directory in order to execute the
       programs in it. The programs are executed with a cwd of $HOME, and
       &ltargument&gt is parsed as a command-line string.
