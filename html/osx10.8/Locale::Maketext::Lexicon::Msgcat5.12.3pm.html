NAME
       Locale::Maketext::Lexicon::Msgcat - Msgcat catalog parser Maketext

SYNOPSIS
	   package Hello::I18N;
	   use base 'Locale::Maketext';
	   use Locale::Maketext::Lexicon {
	       en => ['Msgcat', 'en_US/hello.pl.m'],
	   };

	   package main;
	   my $lh = Hello::I18N->get_handle('en');
	   print $lh->maketext(1,2);   # set 1, msg 2
	   print $lh->maketext("1,2"); # same thing

DESCRIPTION
       This module parses one or more Msgcat catalogs in plain text format,
       and returns a Lexicon hash, which may be looked up either with a two-
       argument form ("$set_id, $msg_id") or as a single string
       ("$set_id,$msg_id").

NOTES
       All special characters ("[", "]" and "~") in catalogs will be escaped
       so they lose their magic meanings.  That means "->maketext" calls to
       this lexicon will not take any additional arguments.
