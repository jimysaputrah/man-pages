NAME
       PPI::Node - Abstract PPI Node class, an Element that can contain other
       Elements

INHERITANCE
	 PPI::Node
	 isa PPI::Element

SYNOPSIS
	 # Create a typical node (a Document in this case)
	 my $Node = PPI::Document-&gtnew;

	 # Add an element to the node( in this case, a token )
	 my $Token = PPI::Token::Word-&gtnew('my');
	 $Node-&gtadd_element( $Token );

	 # Get the elements for the Node
	 my @elements = $Node-&gtchildren;

	 # Find all the barewords within a Node
	 my $barewords = $Node-&gtfind( 'PPI::Token::Word' );

	 # Find by more complex criteria
	 my $my_tokens = $Node-&gtfind( sub { $_[1]-&gtcontent eq 'my' } );

	 # Remove all the whitespace
	 $Node-&gtprune( 'PPI::Token::Whitespace' );

	 # Remove by more complex criteria
	 $Node-&gtprune( sub { $_[1]-&gtcontent eq 'my' } );

DESCRIPTION
       The "PPI::Node" class provides an abstract base class for the Element
       classes that are able to contain other elements PPI::Document,
       PPI::Statement, and PPI::Structure.

       As well as those listed below, all of the methods that apply to
       PPI::Element objects also apply to "PPI::Node" objects.

METHODS
   scope
       The "scope" method returns true if the node represents a lexical scope
       boundary, or false if it does not.

   add_element $Element
       The "add_element" method adds a PPI::Element object to the end of a
       "PPI::Node". Because Elements maintain links to their parent, an
       Element can only be added to a single Node.

       Returns true if the PPI::Element was added. Returns "undef" if the
       Element was already within another Node, or the method is not passed a
       PPI::Element object.

   elements
       The "elements" method accesses all child elements structurally within
       the "PPI::Node" object. Note that in the base of the PPI::Structure
       classes, this "DOES" include the brace tokens at either end of the
       structure.

       Returns a list of zero or more PPI::Element objects.

       Alternatively, if called in the scalar context, the "elements" method
       returns a count of the number of elements.

   first_element
       The "first_element" method accesses the first element structurally
       within the "PPI::Node" object. As for the "elements" method, this does
       include the brace tokens for PPI::Structure objects.

       Returns a PPI::Element object, or "undef" if for some reason the
       "PPI::Node" object does not contain any elements.

   last_element
       The "last_element" method accesses the last element structurally within
       the "PPI::Node" object. As for the "elements" method, this does include
       the brace tokens for PPI::Structure objects.

       Returns a PPI::Element object, or "undef" if for some reason the
       "PPI::Node" object does not contain any elements.

   children
       The "children" method accesses all child elements lexically within the
       "PPI::Node" object. Note that in the case of the PPI::Structure
       classes, this does NOT include the brace tokens at either end of the
       structure.

       Returns a list of zero of more PPI::Element objects.

       Alternatively, if called in the scalar context, the "children" method
       returns a count of the number of lexical children.

   schildren
       The "schildren" method is really just a convenience, the significant-
       only variation of the normal "children" method.

       In list context, returns a list of significant children. In scalar
       context, returns the number of significant children.

   child $index
       The "child" method accesses a child PPI::Element object by its position
       within the Node.

       Returns a PPI::Element object, or "undef" if there is no child element
       at that node.

   schild $index
       The lexical structure of the Perl language ignores 'insignificant'
       items, such as whitespace and comments, while PPI treats these items as
       valid tokens so that it can reassemble the file at any time. Because of
       this, in many situations there is a need to find an Element within a
       Node by index, only counting lexically significant Elements.

       The "schild" method returns a child Element by index, ignoring
       insignificant Elements. The index of a child Element is specified in
       the same way as for a normal array, with the first Element at index 0,
       and negative indexes used to identify a "from the end" position.

   contains $Element
       The "contains" method is used to determine if another PPI::Element
       object is logically "within" a "PPI::Node". For the special case of the
       brace tokens at either side of a PPI::Structure object, they are
       generally considered "within" a PPI::Structure object, even if they are
       not actually in the elements for the PPI::Structure.

       Returns true if the PPI::Element is within us, false if not, or "undef"
       on error.

   find $class | \&wanted
       The "find" method is used to search within a code tree for PPI::Element
       objects that meet a particular condition.

       To specify the condition, the method can be provided with either a
       simple class name (full or shortened), or a "CODE"/function reference.

	 # Find all single quotes in a Document (which is a Node)
	 $Document-&gtfind('PPI::Quote::Single');

	 # The same thing with a shortened class name
	 $Document-&gtfind('Quote::Single');

	 # Anything more elaborate, we so with the sub
	 $Document-&gtfind( sub {
	       # At the top level of the file...
	       $_[1]-&gtparent == $_[0]
	       and (
		       # ...find all comments and POD
		       $_[1]-&gtisa('PPI::Token::Pod')
		       or
		       $_[1]-&gtisa('PPI::Token::Comment')
	       )
	 } );

       The function will be passed two arguments, the top-level "PPI::Node"
       you are searching in and the current PPI::Element that the condition is
       testing.

       The anonymous function should return one of three values. Returning
       true indicates a condition match, defined-false (0 or '') indicates no-
       match, and "undef" indicates no-match and no-descend.

       In the last case, the tree walker will skip over anything below the
       "undef"-returning element and move on to the next element at the same
       level.

       To halt the entire search and return "undef" immediately, a condition
       function should throw an exception (i.e. "die").

       Note that this same wanted logic is used for all methods documented to
       have a "\&wanted" parameter, as this one does.

       The "find" method returns a reference to an array of PPI::Element
       objects that match the condition, false (but defined) if no Elements
       match the condition, or "undef" if you provide a bad condition, or an
       error occurs during the search process.

       In the case of a bad condition, a warning will be emitted as well.

   find_first $class | \&wanted
       If the normal "find" method is like a grep, then "find_first" is
       equivalent to the Scalar::Util "first" function.

       Given an element class or a wanted function, it will search depth-first
       through a tree until it finds something that matches the condition,
       returning the first Element that it encounters.

       See the "find" method for details on the format of the search
       condition.

       Returns the first PPI::Element object that matches the condition, false
       if nothing matches the condition, or "undef" if given an invalid
       condition, or an error occurs.

   find_any $class | \&wanted
       The "find_any" method is a short-circuiting true/false method that
       behaves like the normal "find" method, but returns true as soon as it
       finds any Elements that match the search condition.

       See the "find" method for details on the format of the search
       condition.

       Returns true if any Elements that match the condition can be found,
       false if not, or "undef" if given an invalid condition, or an error
       occurs.

   remove_child $Element
       If passed a PPI::Element object that is a direct child of the Node, the
       "remove_element" method will remove the "Element" intact, along with
       any of its children. As such, this method acts essentially as a 'cut'
       function.

       If successful, returns the removed element.  Otherwise, returns
       "undef".

   prune $class | \&wanted
       The "prune" method is used to strip PPI::Element objects out of a code
       tree. The argument is the same as for the "find" method, either a class
       name, or an anonymous subroutine which returns true/false. Any Element
       that matches the class|wanted will be deleted from the code tree, along
       with any of its children.

       The "prune" method returns the number of "Element" objects that matched
       and were removed, non-recursively. This might also be zero, so avoid a
       simple true/false test on the return false of the "prune" method. It
       returns "undef" on error, which you probably should test for.

TO DO
       - Move as much as possible to PPI::XS
