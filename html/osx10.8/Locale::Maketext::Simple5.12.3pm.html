NAME
       Locale::Maketext::Simple - Simple interface to
       Locale::Maketext::Lexicon

VERSION
       This document describes version 0.18 of Locale::Maketext::Simple,
       released Septermber 8, 2006.

SYNOPSIS
       Minimal setup (looks for auto/Foo/*.po and auto/Foo/*.mo):

	   package Foo;
	   use Locale::Maketext::Simple;       # exports 'loc'
	   loc_lang('fr');		       # set language to French
	   sub hello {
	       print loc("Hello, [_1]!", "World");
	   }

       More sophisticated example:

	   package Foo::Bar;
	   use Locale::Maketext::Simple (
	       Class	   => 'Foo',	   # search in auto/Foo/
	       Style	   => 'gettext',   # %1 instead of [_1]
	       Export	   => 'maketext',  # maketext() instead of loc()
	       Subclass    => 'L10N',	   # Foo::L10N instead of Foo::I18N
	       Decode	   => 1,	   # decode entries to unicode-strings
	       Encoding    => 'locale',    # but encode lexicons in current locale
					   # (needs Locale::Maketext::Lexicon 0.36)
	   );
	   sub japh {
	       print maketext("Just another %1 hacker", "Perl");
	   }

DESCRIPTION
       This module is a simple wrapper around Locale::Maketext::Lexicon,
       designed to alleviate the need of creating Language Classes for module
       authors.

       The language used is chosen from the loc_lang call. If a lookup is not
       possible, the i-default language will be used. If the lookup is not in
       the i-default language, then the key will be returned.

       If Locale::Maketext::Lexicon is not present, it implements a minimal
       localization function by simply interpolating "[_1]" with the first
       argument, "[_2]" with the second, etc.  Interpolated function like
       "[quant,_1]" are treated as "[_1]", with the sole exception of
       "[tense,_1,X]", which will append "ing" to "_1" when X is "present", or
       appending "ed" to <_1> otherwise.

OPTIONS
       All options are passed either via the "use" statement, or via an
       explicit "import".

   Class
       By default, Locale::Maketext::Simple draws its source from the calling
       package's auto/ directory; you can override this behaviour by
       explicitly specifying another package as "Class".

   Path
       If your PO and MO files are under a path elsewhere than "auto/", you
       may specify it using the "Path" option.

   Style
       By default, this module uses the "maketext" style of "[_1]" and
       "[quant,_1]" for interpolation.	Alternatively, you can specify the
       "gettext" style, which uses %1 and "%quant(%1)" for interpolation.

       This option is case-insensitive.

   Export
       By default, this module exports a single function, "loc", into its
       caller's namespace.  You can set it to another name, or set it to an
       empty string to disable exporting.

   Subclass
       By default, this module creates an "::I18N" subclass under the caller's
       package (or the package specified by "Class"), and stores lexicon data
       in its subclasses.  You can assign a name other than "I18N" via this
       option.

   Decode
       If set to a true value, source entries will be converted into
       utf8-strings (available in Perl 5.6.1 or later).  This feature needs
       the Encode or Encode::compat module.

   Encoding
       Specifies an encoding to store lexicon entries, instead of
       utf8-strings.  If set to "locale", the encoding from the current locale
       setting is used.  Implies a true value for "Decode".

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
       Thanks to Jos I. Boumans for suggesting this module to be written.

       Thanks to Chia-Liang Kao for suggesting "Path" and "loc_lang".
