NAME
       DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::Informix - Base Storage Class for Informix
       Support

DESCRIPTION
       This class implements storage-specific support for the Informix RDBMS

METHODS
   connect_call_datetime_setup
       Used as:

	 on_connect_call =&gt 'datetime_setup'

       In connect_info to set the "DATE" and "DATETIME" formats.

       Sets the following environment variables:

	   GL_DATE="%m/%d/%Y"
	   GL_DATETIME="%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S%F5"

       The "DBDATE" and "DBCENTURY" environment variables are cleared.

       NOTE: setting the "GL_DATE" environment variable seems to have no
       effect after the process has started, so the default format is used.
       The "GL_DATETIME" setting does take effect however.

       The "DATETIME" data type supports up to 5 digits after the decimal
       point for second precision, depending on how you have declared your
       column. The full possible precision is used.

       The column declaration for a "DATETIME" with maximum precision is:

	 column_name DATETIME YEAR TO FRACTION(5)

       The "DATE" data type stores the date portion only, and it MUST be
       declared with:

	 data_type =&gt 'date'

       in your Result class.

       You will need the DateTime::Format::Strptime module for inflation to
       work.
