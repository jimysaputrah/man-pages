NAME
       MooseX::Storage::Basic - The simplest level of serialization

SYNOPSIS
	 package Point;
	 use Moose;
	 use MooseX::Storage;

	 our $VERSION = '0.01';

	 with Storage;

	 has 'x' =&gt (is =&gt 'rw', isa =&gt 'Int');
	 has 'y' =&gt (is =&gt 'rw', isa =&gt 'Int');

	 1;

	 my $p = Point-&gtnew(x =&gt 10, y =&gt 10);

	 ## methods to pack/unpack an
	 ## object in perl data structures

	 # pack the class into a hash
	 $p-&gtpack(); # { __CLASS__ =&gt 'Point-0.01', x =&gt 10, y =&gt 10 }

	 # unpack the hash into a class
	 my $p2 = Point-&gtunpack({ __CLASS__ =&gt 'Point-0.01', x =&gt 10, y =&gt 10 });

	 # unpack the hash, with insertion of paramaters
	 my $p3 = Point-&gtunpack( $p-&gtpack, inject =&gt { x =&gt 11 } );

DESCRIPTION
       This is the most basic form of serialization. This is used by default
       but the exported "Storage" function.

METHODS
       pack ([ disable_cycle_check = 1])&gt
	   Providing the "disable_cycle_check" argument disables checks for
	   any cyclical references. The current implementation for this check
	   is rather naive, so if you know what you are doing, you can bypass
	   this check.

	   This trait is applied on a perl-case basis. To set this flag for
	   all objects that inherit from this role, see
	   MooseX::Storage::Traits::DisableCycleDetection.

       unpack ($data [, insert = { key =&gt val, ... } ] )&gt
	   Providing the "insert" argument let's you supply additional
	   arguments to the class' "new" function, or override ones from the
	   serialized data.
