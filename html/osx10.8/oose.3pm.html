NAME
       oose - syntactic sugar to make Moose one-liners easier

VERSION
       version 2.0205

SYNOPSIS
	 # create a Moose class on the fly ...
	 perl -Moose=Foo -e 'has bar =&gt ( is=&gtq[ro], default =&gt q[baz] ); print Foo-&gtnew-&gtbar' # prints baz

	 # loads an existing class (Moose or non-Moose)
	 # and re-"opens" the package definition to make
	 # debugging/introspection easier
	 perl -Moose=+My::Class -e 'print join ", " =&gt __PACKAGE__-&gtmeta-&gtget_method_list'

	 # also loads Moose::Util::TypeConstraints to allow subtypes etc
	 perl -Moose=Person -e'subtype q[ValidAge] =&gt as q[Int] =&gt where { $_ &gt 0 && $_ &lt 78 }; has =&gt age ( isa =&gt q[ValidAge], is =&gt q[ro]); Person-&gtnew(age =&gt 90)'

DESCRIPTION
       oose.pm is a simple source filter that adds "package $name; use Moose;
       use Moose::Util::TypeConstraints;" to the beginning of your script and
       was entirely created because typing "perl -e'package Foo; use Moose;
       ...'" was annoying me.

INTERFACE
       oose provides exactly one method and it's automatically called by perl:

       import($package)
	   Pass a package name to import to be used by the source filter. The
	   package defaults to "Class" if none is given.

DEPENDENCIES
       You will need Filter::Simple and eventually Moose

INCOMPATIBILITIES
       None reported. But it is a source filter and might have issues there.

BUGS
       See "BUGS" in Moose for details on reporting bugs.
