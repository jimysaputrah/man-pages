NAME
       Mail::Internet - manipulate email messages

SYNOPSIS
	 use Mail::Internet;
	 my $msg = Mail::Internet->new(\*STDIN);

DESCRIPTION
       This package implements reading, creating, manipulating, and writing
       email messages.	Sometimes, the implementation tries to be too smart,
       but in the general case it works as expected.

       If you start writing a new application, you should use the Mail::Box
       distribution, which has more features and handles messages much better
       according to the RFCs.  See <http://perl.overmeer.net/mailbox/>.  You
       may also chose MIME::Entity, to get at least some multipart support in
       your application.

METHODS
   Constructors
       $obj->dup

	   Duplicate the message as a whole.  Both header and body will be
	   deep-copied: a new Mail::Internet object is returned.

       $obj->extract(ARRAY-of-LINES)

	   Extract header and body from an ARRAY of message lines.  Requires
	   an object already created with new(), which contents will get
	   overwritten.

       $obj->new([ARG], [OPTIONS])

       Mail::Internet->new([ARG], [OPTIONS])

	   ARG is optional and may be either a file descriptor (reference to a
	   GLOB) or a reference to an array. If given the new object will be
	   initialized with headers and body either from the array of read
	   from the file descriptor.

	   The Mail::Header::new() OPTIONS "Modify", "MailFrom" and
	   "FoldLength" may also be given.

	    Option--Default
	    Body    []
	    Header  undef

	   . Body => ARRAY-of-LINES

	       The value of this option should be a reference to an array
	       which contains the lines for the body of the message. Each line
	       should be terminated with "\n" (LF). If Body is given then
	       "Mail::Internet" will not attempt to read the body from "ARG"
	       (even if it is specified).

	   . Header => Mail::Header

	       The value of this option should be a Mail::Header object. If
	       given then "Mail::Internet" will not attempt to read a mail
	       header from "ARG", if it was specified.

       $obj->read(FILEHANDLE)

	   Read a message from the FILEHANDLE into an already existing message
	   object.  Better use new() with the FILEHANDLE as first argument.

   Accessors
       $obj->body([BODY])

	   Returns the body of the message. This is a reference to an array.
	   Each entry in the array represents a single line in the message.

	   If BODY is given, it can be a reference to an array or an array,
	   then the body will be replaced. If a reference is passed, it is
	   used directly and not copied, so any subsequent changes to the
	   array will change the contents of the body.

       $obj->head

	   Returns the "Mail::Header" object which holds the headers for the
	   current message

   Processing the message as a whole
       $obj->as_mbox_string([ALREADY_ESCAPED])

	   Returns the message as a string in mbox format.  "ALREADY_ESCAPED",
	   if given and true, indicates that escape_from() has already been
	   called on this object.

       $obj->as_string

	   Returns the message as a single string.

       $obj->print([FILEHANDLE])

	   Print the header, body or whole message to file descriptor
	   FILEHANDLE.	$fd should be a reference to a GLOB. If FILEHANDLE is
	   not given the output will be sent to STDOUT.

	   example:

	       $mail->print( \*STDOUT );  # Print message to STDOUT

       $obj->print_body([FILEHANDLE])

	   Print only the body to the FILEHANDLE (default STDOUT).

       $obj->print_header([FILEHANDLE])

	   Print only the header to the FILEHANDLE (default STDOUT).

   Processing the header
       Most of these methods are simply wrappers around methods provided by
       Mail::Header.

       $obj->add(PAIRS-of-FIELD)

	   The PAIRS are field-name and field-content.	For each PAIR,
	   Mail::Header::add() is called.  All fields are added after existing
	   fields.  The last addition is returned.

       $obj->combine(TAG, [WITH])

	   See Mail::Header::combine().

       $obj->delete(TAG, [TAGs])

	   Delete all fields with the name TAG.  Mail::Header::delete() is
	   doing the work.

       $obj->fold([LENGTH])

	   See Mail::Header::fold().

       $obj->fold_length([TAG], [LENGTH])

	   See Mail::Header::fold_length().

       $obj->get(TAG, [TAGs])

	   In LIST context, all fields with the name TAG are returned.	In
	   SCALAR context, only the first field which matches the earliest TAG
	   is returned.  Mail::Header::get() is called to collect the data.

       $obj->header([ARRAY-of-LINES])

	   See Mail::Header::header().

       $obj->replace(PAIRS-of-FIELD)

	   The PAIRS are field-name and field-content.	For each PAIR,
	   Mail::Header::replace() is called with INDEX 0. If a FIELD is
	   already in the header, it will be removed first.  Do not specified
	   the same field-name twice.

   Processing the body
       $obj->remove_sig([NLINES])

	   Attempts to remove a users signature from the body of a message. It
	   does this by looking for a line equal to '-- ' within the last
	   "NLINES" of the message. If found then that line and all lines
	   after it will be removed. If "NLINES" is not given a default value
	   of 10 will be used. This would be of most use in auto-reply
	   scripts.

       $obj->sign(OPTIONS)

	   Add your signature to the body.  remove_sig() will strip existing
	   signatures first.

	    Option   --Default
	    File       undef
	    Signature  []

	   . File => FILEHANDLE

	       Take from the FILEHANDLE all lines starting from the first
	       "--".

	   . Signature => STRING|ARRAY-of-LINES

       $obj->tidy_body

	   Removes all leading and trailing lines from the body that only
	   contain white spaces.

   High-level functionality
       $obj->escape_from

	   It can cause problems with some applications if a message contains
	   a line starting with `From ', in particular when attempting to
	   split a folder.  This method inserts a leading "`"'> on anyline
	   that matches the regular expression "/^"*From/>

       $obj->nntppost([OPTIONS])

	   Post an article via NNTP.  Requires Net::NNTP to be installed.

	    Option--Default
	    Debug   <false>
	    Host    <required>
	    Port    119

	   . Debug => BOOLEAN

	       Debug value to pass to Net::NNTP, see Net::NNTP

	   . Host => HOSTNAME|Net::NNTP object

	       Name of NNTP server to connect to, or a Net::NNTP object to
	       use.

	   . Port => INTEGER

	       Port number to connect to on remote host

       $obj->reply(OPTIONS)

	   Create a new object with header initialised for a reply to the
	   current object. And the body will be a copy of the current message
	   indented.

	   The ".mailhdr" file in your home directory (if exists) will be read
	   first, to provide defaults.

	    Option  --Default
	    Exclude   []
	    Indent    '>'
	    Keep      []
	    ReplyAll  false

	   . Exclude => ARRAY-of-FIELDS

	       Remove the listed FIELDS from the produced message.

	   . Indent => STRING

	       Use as indentation string.  The string may contain "%%" to get
	       a single "%", %f to get the first from name, %F is the first
	       character of %f, %l is the last name, %L its first character,
	       %n the whole from string, and %I the first character of each of
	       the names in the from string.

	   . Keep => ARRAY-of-FIELDS

	       Copy the listed FIELDS from the original message.

	   . ReplyAll => BOOLEAN

	       Automatically include all To and Cc addresses of the original
	       mail, excluding those mentioned in the Bcc list.

       $obj->send([TYPE, [ARGS...]])

	   Send a Mail::Internet message using Mail::Mailer.  TYPE and ARGS
	   are passed on to Mail::Mailer::new().

       $obj->smtpsend([OPTIONS])

	   Send a Mail::Internet message using direct SMTP.  to the given
	   ADDRESSES, each can be either a string or a reference to a list of
	   email addresses. If none of "To", <Cc> or "Bcc" are given then the
	   addresses are extracted from the message being sent.

	   The return value will be a list of email addresses that the message
	   was sent to. If the message was not sent the list will be empty.

	   Requires Net::SMTP and Net::Domain to be installed.

	    Option  --Default
	    Bcc       undef
	    Cc	      undef
	    Debug     <false>
	    Hello     localhost.localdomain
	    Host      $ENV{SMTPHOSTS}
	    MailFrom  Mail::Util::mailaddress()
	    Port      25
	    To	      undef

	   . Bcc => ADDRESSES

	       use

	       If "Host" is not given then the SMTP host is found by
	       attempting connections first to hosts specified in
	       $ENV{SMTPHOSTS}, a colon separated list, then "mailhost" and
	       "localhost".

	   . MailFrom => ADDRESS

	       The e-mail address which is used as sender.  By default,
	       Mail::Util::mailaddress() provides the address of the sender.

	   . Port => INTEGER

	       Port number to connect to on remote host

	   . To => ADDRESSES

       $obj->unescape_from(())

	   Remove the escaping added by escape_from().
