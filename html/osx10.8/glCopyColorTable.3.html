NAME
       glCopyColorTable - copy pixels into a color table


C SPECIFICATION
       void glCopyColorTable( GLenum target,
			      GLenum internalformat,
			      GLint x,
			      GLint y,
			      GLsizei width )


PARAMETERS
       target	       The   color   table  target.  Must  be  GL_COLOR_TABLE,
		       GL_POST_CONVOLUTION_COLOR_TABLE, 		    or
		       GL_POST_COLOR_MATRIX_COLOR_TABLE.

       internalformat  The  internal  storage	of the texture image.  Must be
		       one of  the  following  symbolic  constants:  GL_ALPHA,
		       GL_ALPHA4,     GL_ALPHA8,    GL_ALPHA12,    GL_ALPHA16,
		       GL_LUMINANCE,	   GL_LUMINANCE4,	GL_LUMINANCE8,
		       GL_LUMINANCE12,	 GL_LUMINANCE16,   GL_LUMINANCE_ALPHA,
		       GL_LUMINANCE4_ALPHA4,		 GL_LUMINANCE6_ALPHA2,
		       GL_LUMINANCE8_ALPHA8,		GL_LUMINANCE12_ALPHA4,
		       GL_LUMINANCE12_ALPHA12,	       GL_LUMINANCE16_ALPHA16,
		       GL_INTENSITY,	   GL_INTENSITY4,	GL_INTENSITY8,
		       GL_INTENSITY12,	GL_INTENSITY16,  GL_R3_G3_B2,  GL_RGB,
		       GL_RGB4,    GL_RGB5,   GL_RGB8,	 GL_RGB10,   GL_RGB12,
		       GL_RGB16,  GL_RGBA,  GL_RGBA2,  GL_RGBA4,   GL_RGB5_A1,
		       GL_RGBA8, GL_RGB10_A2, GL_RGBA12, GL_RGBA16.

       x	       The  x coordinate of the lower-left corner of the pixel
		       rectangle to be transferred to the color table.

       y	       The y coordinate of the lower-left corner of the  pixel
		       rectangle to be transferred to the color table.

       width	       The width of the pixel rectangle.

DESCRIPTION
       glCopyColorTable  loads	a  color  table  with  pixels from the current
       GL_READ_BUFFER (rather than from  main  memory,	as  is	the  case  for
       glColorTable).

       The  screen-aligned  pixel  rectangle  with lower-left corner at (x, y)
       having width width and height 1 is loaded into the color table. If  any
       pixels  within  this  region  are outside the window that is associated
       with the GL context, the values obtained for  those  pixels  are  unde-
       fined.

       The  pixels in the rectangle are processed just as if glReadPixels were
       called, with internalformat set to RGBA, but processing stops after the
       final conversion to RGBA.

       The four scale parameters and the four bias parameters that are defined
       for the table are then used to scale and bias the R, G, B, and A compo-
       nents  of  each pixel. The scale and bias parameters are set by calling
       glColorTableParameter.

       Next, the R, G, B, and A values are clamped to the range  [0,1].   Each
       pixel  is  then converted to the internal  specified by internalformat.
       This conversion simply maps the component values of the pixel (R, G, B,
       and  A)	to  the  values  included  in the internal  (red, green, blue,
       alpha, luminance, and intensity).  The mapping is as follows:


	Internal Format     Channel mapping
	GL_ALPHA	    A=Alpha
	GL_LUMINANCE	    R=Luminance
	GL_LUMINANCE_ALPHA  A=Alpha, R=Luminance
	GL_INTENSITY	    R=Intensity
	GL_RGB		    R=Red, G=Green, B=Blue
	GL_RGBA 	    R=Red, G=Green, B=Blue, A=Alpha


       Finally, the red, green, blue, alpha, luminance, and/or intensity  com-
       ponents	of  the  resulting pixels are stored in the color table.  They
       form a one-dimensional table with indices in the range  [0, width - 1].


NOTES
       glCopyColorTable  is  available only if GL_ARB_imaging is returned from
       calling glGetString with an argument of GL_EXTENSIONS.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated when target is not one  of	the  allowable
       values.

       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if width is less than zero.

       GL_INVALID_VALUE  is  generated	if  internalformat  is	not one of the
       allowable values.

       GL_TABLE_TOO_LARGE is generated if the requested  color	table  is  too
       large to be supported by the implementation.

       GL_INVALID_OPERATION  is  generated  if	glCopyColorTable  is  executed
       between the execution of glBegin and  the  corresponding  execution  of
       glEnd.
