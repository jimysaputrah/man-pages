NAME
       glutPopWindow,  glutPushWindow  - change the stacking order of the cur-
       rent window relative to its siblings.

SYNTAX
       #include &ltGLUT/glut.h&gt

       void glutPopWindow(void);
       void glutPushWindow(void);

DESCRIPTION
       glutPopWindow and glutPushWindow work on  both  top-level  windows  and
       subwindows.  The  effect  of  pushing and popping windows does not take
       place immediately. Instead the push or pop is saved for execution  upon
       return  to  the	GLUT  event loop. Subsequent push or pop requests on a
       window replace the previously saved request for that window. The effect
       of  pushing and popping top-level windows is subject to the window sys-
       tem's policy for restacking windows.

       glutShowWindow, glutIconifyWindow, glutHideWindow
