NAME
       glCopyTexSubImage1D - copy a one-dimensional texture subimage


C SPECIFICATION
       void glCopyTexSubImage1D( GLenum target,
				 GLint level,
				 GLint xoffset,
				 GLint x,
				 GLint y,
				 GLsizei width )


PARAMETERS
       target	Specifies the target texture.  Must be GL_TEXTURE_1D.

       level	Specifies  the	level-of-detail  number.   Level 0 is the base
		image level.  Level n is the nth mipmap reduction image.

       xoffset	Specifies the texel offset within the texture array.

       x, y	Specify the window coordinates of the left corner of  the  row
		of pixels to be copied.

       width	Specifies the width of the texture subimage.

DESCRIPTION
       glCopyTexSubImage1D  replaces  a  portion  of a one-dimensional texture
       image with pixels from the current  GL_READ_BUFFER  (rather  than  from
       main memory, as is the case for glTexSubImage1D).

       The  screen-aligned  pixel  row	with  left  corner at (x, y), and with
       length width replaces the portion of the texture array with  x  indices
       xoffset through xoffset + xwidth - 1, inclusive. The destination in the
       texture array may not include any texels outside the texture  array  as
       it was originally specified.

       The pixels in the row are processed exactly as if glCopyPixels had been
       called, but the process stops just before final	conversion.   At  this
       point  all  pixel  component values are clamped to the range [0, 1] and
       then converted to the texture's internal   for  storage	in  the  texel
       array.

       It  is not an error to specify a subtexture with zero width, but such a
       specification has no effect.  If any of the pixels within the specified
       row  of	the current GL_READ_BUFFER are outside the read window associ-
       ated with the current rendering context, then the values  obtained  for
       those pixels are undefined.

       No change is made to the internalformat, width, or border parameters of
       the specified texture array or to texel values  outside	the  specified
       subregion.

NOTES
       glCopyTexSubImage1D  is	available  only  if  the  GL version is 1.1 or
       greater.

       Texturing has no effect in color index mode.

       glPixelStore and glPixelTransfer modes affect texture images in exactly
       the way they affect glDrawPixels.

       When  the  GL_ARB_imaging  extension  is supported, the RGBA components
       copied from the framebuffer may be processed by the  imaging  pipeline.
       See glTexImage1D for specific details.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if target is not GL_TEXTURE_1D.

       GL_INVALID_OPERATION  is  generated  if	the texture array has not been
       defined by a previous glTexImage1D or glCopyTexImage1D operation.

       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if level is less than 0.

       GL_INVALID_VALUE may be generated if level &gt log2( max), where  max  is
       the returned value of GL_MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE.

       GL_INVALID_VALUE  is  generated if y &lt -b or if width &lt	-b, where b is
       the border width of the texture array.

       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if xoffset &lt -b, or (f2xoffset+f2width) &gt
       (w-b),  where w is the GL_TEXTURE_WIDTH, and b is the GL_TEXTURE_BORDER
       of the texture image being modified.  Note that w  includes  twice  the
       border width.
