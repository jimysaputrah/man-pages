DROP OPERATOR CLASS(7)	PostgreSQL 9.1.4 Documentation	DROP OPERATOR CLASS(7)



NAME
       DROP_OPERATOR_CLASS - remove an operator class

SYNOPSIS
       DROP OPERATOR CLASS [ IF EXISTS ] name USING index_method [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ]

DESCRIPTION
       DROP OPERATOR CLASS drops an existing operator class. To execute this
       command you must be the owner of the operator class.


       DROP OPERATOR CLASS does not drop any of the operators or functions
       referenced by the class. If there are any indexes depending on the
       operator class, you will need to specify CASCADE for the drop to
       complete.

PARAMETERS
       IF EXISTS
	   Do not throw an error if the operator class does not exist. A
	   notice is issued in this case.

       name
	   The name (optionally schema-qualified) of an existing operator
	   class.

       index_method
	   The name of the index access method the operator class is for.

       CASCADE
	   Automatically drop objects that depend on the operator class.

       RESTRICT
	   Refuse to drop the operator class if any objects depend on it. This
	   is the default.

NOTES
       DROP OPERATOR CLASS will not drop the operator family containing the
       class, even if there is nothing else left in the family (in particular,
       in the case where the family was implicitly created by CREATE OPERATOR
       CLASS). An empty operator family is harmless, but for the sake of
       tidiness you might wish to remove the family with DROP OPERATOR FAMILY;
       or perhaps better, use DROP OPERATOR FAMILY in the first place.

EXAMPLES
       Remove the B-tree operator class widget_ops:

	   DROP OPERATOR CLASS widget_ops USING btree;

       This command will not succeed if there are any existing indexes that
       use the operator class. Add CASCADE to drop such indexes along with the
       operator class.

COMPATIBILITY
       There is no DROP OPERATOR CLASS statement in the SQL standard.
