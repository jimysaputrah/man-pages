NAME
       Mac::Apps::Launch - Mac module to launch /quit applications

SYNOPSIS
	   use Mac::Apps::Launch;
	   my @apps = qw(R*ch Arch MPGP);
	   my $path = "HD:System Folder:Finder";
	   LaunchApps([@apps], 1) or warn $^E; # launch and switch to front
	   LaunchApps([@apps])	  or warn $^E; # launch and don't switch
	   LaunchApps($app, 1)	  or warn $^E; # launch and switch to front
	   LaunchSpecs($path, 1)  or warn $^E; # use path instead of app ID
	   QuitApps(@apps)	  or warn $^E; # quit all @apps
	   QuitAllApps(@apps)	  or warn $^E; # quit all except @apps
	   IsRunning('MACS');		       # returns boolean for whether
					       # given app ID is running
	   SetFront('MACS')	  or warn $^E; # set Finder to front
	   Hide('MACS') 	  or warn $^E; # hide Finder
	   Show('Finder', 1)	  or warn $^E; # show Finder (1 == use name)

DESCRIPTION
       Simply launch or quit applications by their creator ID.	The Finder can
       be quit in this way, though it cannot be launched in this way.

       This module is used by many other modules.

       This module as written does not work with MacPerls prior to 5.1.4r4.

       "Hide" and "Show" do not currently work on Mac OS X.

       Apps that don't have signatures under Mac OS X currently aren't
       handled, except with LaunchSpecs().

       "SetFront" and "IsRunning" can take a four-char creator ID ('MACS'), a
       bundle ID ('com.apple.Finder'), or a path
       (/System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app).  They both optionally take a
       second parameter which affirms that the data is indeed a path (for
       those rare cases where a path might possibly look like a creator ID or
       bundle ID ... you never know).

       "IsRunning" will return the PSN of the application if it is running,
       which you can then use for targetting the app, or converting to a PID
       (with "Mac::Processes::GetProcessPID()"), to send signals to it.

EXPORT
       Exports functions "QuitApps", "QuitAllApps", and "LaunchApps",
       "IsRunning", "LaunchSpecs", "SetFront", "Hide", "Show".
