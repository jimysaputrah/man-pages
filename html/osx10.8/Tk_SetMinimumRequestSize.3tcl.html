NAME
       Tk_GeometryRequest,   Tk_SetMinimumRequestSize,	 Tk_SetInternalBorder,
       Tk_SetInternalBorderEx - specify desired geometry  or  internal	border
       for a window

SYNOPSIS
       #include <tk.h>

       Tk_GeometryRequest(tkwin, reqWidth, reqHeight)

       Tk_SetMinimumRequestSize(tkwin, minWidth, minHeight)

       Tk_SetInternalBorder(tkwin, width)

       Tk_SetInternalBorderEx(tkwin, left, right, top, bottom)

ARGUMENTS
       Tk_Window tkwin (in)		   Window  for which geometry is being
					   requested.

       int reqWidth (in)		   Desired width for tkwin,  in  pixel
					   units.

       int reqHeight (in)		   Desired  height for tkwin, in pixel
					   units.

       int minWidth (in)		   Desired minimum requested width for
					   tkwin, in pixel units.

       int minHeight (in)		   Desired  minimum  requested	height
					   for tkwin, in pixel units.

       int width (in)			   Space to leave for internal	border
					   for tkwin, in pixel units.

       int left (in)			   Space  to  leave  for  left side of
					   internal border for tkwin, in pixel
					   units.

       int right (in)			   Space  to  leave  for right side of
					   internal border for tkwin, in pixel
					   units.

       int top (in)			   Space  to  leave  for  top  side of
					   internal border for tkwin, in pixel
					   units.

					   internal border for tkwin, in pixel
					   units.

DESCRIPTION
       Tk_GeometryRequest  is called by widget code to indicate its preference
       for the dimensions of a particular window.  The arguments to  Tk_Geome-
       tryRequest  are	made available to the geometry manager for the window,
       which then decides on the actual geometry  for  the  window.   Although
       geometry  managers  generally try to satisfy requests made to Tk_Geome-
       tryRequest, there is no guarantee that this will  always  be  possible.
       Widget code should not assume that a geometry request will be satisfied
       until it receives a ConfigureNotify event indicating that the  geometry
       change  has  occurred.	Widget	code should never call procedures like
       Tk_ResizeWindow directly.  Instead, it should invoke Tk_GeometryRequest
       and leave the final geometry decisions to the geometry manager.

       If  tkwin  is a top-level window, then the geometry information will be
       passed to the window manager using the standard ICCCM protocol.

       Tk_SetInternalBorder is called by widget code to indicate that the wid-
       get has an internal border.  This means that the widget draws a decora-
       tive border inside the window instead of using the standard X  borders,
       which are external to the window's area.  For example, internal borders
       are used to draw 3-D effects.  Width specifies the width of the	border
       in  pixels.  Geometry managers will use this information to avoid plac-
       ing any children of tkwin overlapping the  outermost  width  pixels  of
       tkwin's area.

       Tk_SetInternalBorderEx  works  like  Tk_SetInternalBorder  but lets you
       specify different widths for different sides of the window.

       Tk_SetMinimumRequestSize is called by widget code to  indicate  that  a
       geometry  manager  should  request  at  least this size for the widget.
       This allows a widget to have some control over its size when  a	propa-
       gating geometry manager is used inside it.

       The  information  specified in calls to Tk_GeometryRequest, Tk_SetMini-
       mumRequestSize, Tk_SetInternalBorder and Tk_SetInternalBorderEx can  be
       retrieved  using  the macros Tk_ReqWidth, Tk_ReqHeight, Tk_MinReqWidth,
       Tk_MinReqHeight, Tk_MinReqWidth, Tk_InternalBorderLeft, Tk_InternalBor-
       derRight,  Tk_InternalBorderTop	and  Tk_InternalBorderBottom.  See the
       Tk_WindowId manual entry for details.
