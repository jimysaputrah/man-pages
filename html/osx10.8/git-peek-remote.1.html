NAME
       git-peek-remote - List the references in a remote repository

SYNOPSIS
       git peek-remote [--upload-pack=<git-upload-pack>] [<host>:]<directory>


DESCRIPTION
       This command is deprecated; use git ls-remote instead.

OPTIONS
       --upload-pack=<git-upload-pack>
	   Use this to specify the path to git-upload-pack on the remote side,
	   if it is not found on your $PATH. Some installations of sshd
	   ignores the user's environment setup scripts for login shells (e.g.
	   .bash_profile) and your privately installed git may not be found on
	   the system default $PATH. Another workaround suggested is to set up
	   your $PATH in ".bashrc", but this flag is for people who do not
	   want to pay the overhead for non-interactive shells, but prefer
	   having a lean .bashrc file (they set most of the things up in
	   .bash_profile).

       <host>
	   A remote host that houses the repository. When this part is
	   specified, git-upload-pack is invoked via ssh.

       <directory>
	   The repository to sync from.

GIT
       Part of the git(1) suite
