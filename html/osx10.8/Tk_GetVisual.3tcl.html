NAME
       Tk_GetVisual - translate from string to visual

SYNOPSIS
       #include &lttk.h&gt

       Visual *
       Tk_GetVisual(interp, tkwin, string, depthPtr, colormapPtr)

ARGUMENTS
       Tcl_Interp *interp (in)		     Interpreter   to  use  for  error
					     reporting.

       Tk_Window tkwin (in)		     Token for	window	in  which  the
					     visual will be used.

       const char *string (in)		     String    that   identifies   the
					     desired visual.   See  below  for
					     valid formats.

       int *depthPtr (out)		     Depth  of	returned  visual  gets
					     stored here.

       Colormap *colormapPtr (out)	     If non-NULL then a suitable  col-
					     ormap for visual is found and its
					     identifier is stored here.

DESCRIPTION
       Tk_GetVisual takes a string description of a visual and finds  a  suit-
       able  X Visual for use in tkwin, if there is one.  It returns a pointer
       to the X Visual structure for the visual and stores the number of  bits
       per  pixel  for	it at *depthPtr.  If string is unrecognizable or if no
       suitable visual could be found, then NULL is returned and  Tk_GetVisual
       leaves  an  error  message  in interp-&gtresult.  If colormap is non-NULL
       then Tk_GetVisual also locates an appropriate colormap for use with the
       result visual and stores its X identifier at *colormapPtr.

       The  string argument specifies the desired visual in one of the follow-
       ing ways:

       class depth    The string consists of a class name followed by an inte-
		      ger  depth,  with  any  amount of white space (including
		      none) in between.  class selects what sort of visual  is
		      desired  and  must  be  one  of  directcolor, grayscale,
		      greyscale, pseudocolor, staticcolor, staticgray, static-
		      grey,  or  truecolor,  or  a unique abbreviation.  depth
		      specifies how many bits per pixel  are  needed  for  the
		      visual.	If possible, Tk_GetVisual will return a visual
		      with this depth; if there is no visual  of  the  desired
		      depth  then  Tk_GetVisual  looks first for a visual with
		      greater depth, then one with less depth.

       default	      Use the default visual for tkwin's screen.

       pathName       Use the visual for the window given by pathName.	 path-
		      Name  must be the name of a window on the same screen as
		      tkwin.

       number	      Use the visual whose X identifier is number.

       best ?depth?   Choose the "best possible" visual, using	the  following
		      rules, in decreasing order of priority:

		      (a)    a	visual	that  has exactly the desired depth is
			     best, followed by a  visual  with	greater  depth
			     than requested (but as little extra as possible),
			     followed  by  a  visual  with  less  depth   than
			     requested (but as great a depth as possible);

		      (b)    if no depth is specified, then the deepest avail-
			     able visual is chosen;

		      (c)    pseudocolor is better than truecolor  or  direct-
			     color,  which  are better than staticcolor, which
			     is better than staticgray or grayscale;

		      (d)    the default visual for the screen is better  than
			     any other visual.

CREDITS
       The idea for Tk_GetVisual, and the first implementation, came from Paul
       Mackerras.
