NAME
       TAP::Formatter::Console - Harness output delegate for default console
       output

VERSION
       Version 3.17

DESCRIPTION
       This provides console orientated output formatting for TAP::Harness.

SYNOPSIS
	use TAP::Formatter::Console;
	my $harness = TAP::Formatter::Console-&gtnew( \%args );

METHODS
   Class Methods
       "new"

	my %args = (
	   verbose =&gt 1,
	)
	my $harness = TAP::Formatter::Console-&gtnew( \%args );

       The constructor returns a new "TAP::Formatter::Console" object. If a
       TAP::Harness is created with no "formatter" a "TAP::Formatter::Console"
       is automatically created. If any of the following options were given to
       TAP::Harness-&gtnew they well be passed to this constructor which accepts
       an optional hashref whose allowed keys are:

       o   "verbosity"

	   Set the verbosity level.

       o   "verbose"

	   Printing individual test results to STDOUT.

       o   "timer"

	   Append run time for each test to output. Uses Time::HiRes if
	   available.

       o   "failures"

	   Show test failures (this is a no-op if "verbose" is selected).

       o   "comments"

	   Show test comments (this is a no-op if "verbose" is selected).

       o   "quiet"

	   Suppressing some test output (mostly failures while tests are
	   running).

       o   "really_quiet"

	   Suppressing everything but the tests summary.

       o   "silent"

	   Suppressing all output.

       o   "errors"

	   If parse errors are found in the TAP output, a note of this will be
	   made in the summary report.	To see all of the parse errors, set
	   this argument to true:

	     errors =&gt 1

       o   "directives"

	   If set to a true value, only test results with directives will be
	   displayed.  This overrides other settings such as "verbose",
	   "failures", or "comments".

       o   "stdout"

	   A filehandle for catching standard output.

       o   "color"

	   If defined specifies whether color output is desired. If "color" is
	   not defined it will default to color output if color support is
	   available on the current platform and output is not being
	   redirected.

       o   "jobs"

	   The number of concurrent jobs this formatter will handle.

       o   "show_count"

	   Boolean value.  If false, disables the "X/Y" test count which shows
	   up while tests are running.

       Any keys for which the value is "undef" will be ignored.

       "prepare"

       Called by Test::Harness before any test output is generated.

       This is an advisory and may not be called in the case where tests are
       being supplied to Test::Harness by an iterator.

       "open_test"

       Called to create a new test session. A test session looks like this:

	   my $session = $formatter-&gtopen_test( $test, $parser );
	   while ( defined( my $result = $parser-&gtnext ) ) {
	       $session-&gtresult($result);
	       exit 1 if $result-&gtis_bailout;
	   }
	   $session-&gtclose_test;

       "summary"

	 $harness-&gtsummary( $aggregate );

       "summary" prints the summary report after all tests are run.  The
       argument is an aggregate.
