NAME
       File::Spec::Epoc - methods for Epoc file specs

SYNOPSIS
	require File::Spec::Epoc; # Done internally by File::Spec if needed

DESCRIPTION
       See File::Spec::Unix for a documentation of the methods provided there.
       This package overrides the implementation of these methods, not the
       semantics.

       This package is still work in progress ;-)

       canonpath()
	   No physical check on the filesystem, but a logical cleanup of a
	   path. On UNIX eliminated successive slashes and successive "/.".
