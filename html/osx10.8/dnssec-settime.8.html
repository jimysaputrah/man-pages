DNSSEC-SETTIME(8)		     BIND9		     DNSSEC-SETTIME(8)



NAME
       dnssec-settime - Set the key timing metadata for a DNSSEC key

SYNOPSIS
       dnssec-settime [-f] [-K directory] [-P date/offset] [-A date/offset]
		      [-R date/offset] [-I date/offset] [-D date/offset] [-h]
		      [-v level] [-E engine] {keyfile}

DESCRIPTION
       dnssec-settime reads a DNSSEC private key file and sets the key timing
       metadata as specified by the -P, -A, -R, -I, and -D options. The
       metadata can then be used by dnssec-signzone or other signing software
       to determine when a key is to be published, whether it should be used
       for signing a zone, etc.

       If none of these options is set on the command line, then
       dnssec-settime simply prints the key timing metadata already stored in
       the key.

       When key metadata fields are changed, both files of a key pair
       (Knnnn.+aaa+iiiii.key and Knnnn.+aaa+iiiii.private) are regenerated.
       Metadata fields are stored in the private file. A human-readable
       description of the metadata is also placed in comments in the key file.
       The private file's permissions are always set to be inaccessible to
       anyone other than the owner (mode 0600).

OPTIONS
       -f
	   Force an update of an old-format key with no metadata fields.
	   Without this option, dnssec-settime will fail when attempting to
	   update a legacy key. With this option, the key will be recreated in
	   the new format, but with the original key data retained. The key's
	   creation date will be set to the present time. If no other values
	   are specified, then the key's publication and activation dates will
	   also be set to the present time.

       -K directory
	   Sets the directory in which the key files are to reside.

       -h
	   Emit usage message and exit.

       -v level
	   Sets the debugging level.

       -E engine
	   Use the given OpenSSL engine. When compiled with PKCS#11 support it
	   defaults to pkcs11; the empty name resets it to no engine.

TIMING OPTIONS
       Dates can be expressed in the format YYYYMMDD or YYYYMMDDHHMMSS. If the
       argument begins with a '+' or '-', it is interpreted as an offset from
       the present time. For convenience, if such an offset is followed by one
       of the suffixes 'y', 'mo', 'w', 'd', 'h', or 'mi', then the offset is
       computed in years (defined as 365 24-hour days, ignoring leap years),
       months (defined as 30 24-hour days), weeks, days, hours, or minutes,
       respectively. Without a suffix, the offset is computed in seconds. To
       unset a date, use 'none'.

       -P date/offset
	   Sets the date on which a key is to be published to the zone. After
	   that date, the key will be included in the zone but will not be
	   used to sign it.

       -A date/offset
	   Sets the date on which the key is to be activated. After that date,
	   the key will be included in the zone and used to sign it.

       -R date/offset
	   Sets the date on which the key is to be revoked. After that date,
	   the key will be flagged as revoked. It will be included in the zone
	   and will be used to sign it.

       -I date/offset
	   Sets the date on which the key is to be retired. After that date,
	   the key will still be included in the zone, but it will not be used
	   to sign it.

       -D date/offset
	   Sets the date on which the key is to be deleted. After that date,
	   the key will no longer be included in the zone. (It may remain in
	   the key repository, however.)

       -S predecessor key
	   Select a key for which the key being modified will be an explicit
	   successor. The name, algorithm, size, and type of the predecessor
	   key must exactly match those of the key being modified. The
	   activation date of the successor key will be set to the
	   inactivation date of the predecessor. The publication date will be
	   set to the activation date minus the prepublication interval, which
	   defaults to 30 days.

       -i interval
	   Sets the prepublication interval for a key. If set, then the
	   publication and activation dates must be separated by at least this
	   much time. If the activation date is specified but the publication
	   date isn't, then the publication date will default to this much
	   time before the activation date; conversely, if the publication
	   date is specified but activation date isn't, then activation will
	   be set to this much time after publication.

	   If the key is being set to be an explicit successor to another key,
	   then the default prepublication interval is 30 days; otherwise it
	   is zero.

	   As with date offsets, if the argument is followed by one of the
	   suffixes 'y', 'mo', 'w', 'd', 'h', or 'mi', then the interval is
	   measured in years, months, weeks, days, hours, or minutes,
	   respectively. Without a suffix, the interval is measured in
	   seconds.

PRINTING OPTIONS
       dnssec-settime can also be used to print the timing metadata associated
       with a key.

       -u
	   Print times in UNIX epoch format.

       -p C/P/A/R/I/D/all
	   Print a specific metadata value or set of metadata values. The -p
	   option may be followed by one or more of the following letters to
	   indicate which value or values to print: C for the creation date, P
	   for the publication date, A for the activation date, R for the
	   revocation date, I for the inactivation date, or D for the deletion
	   date. To print all of the metadata, use -p all.
