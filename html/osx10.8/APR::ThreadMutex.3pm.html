NAME
       APR::ThreadMutex - Perl API for APR thread mutexes

Synopsis
	 use APR::ThreadMutex ();

	 my $mutex = APR::ThreadMutex-&gtnew($r-&gtpool);
	 $mutex-&gtlock;
	 $mutex-&gtunlock;
	 $mutex-&gttrylock;

Description
       "APR::ThreadMutex" interfaces APR thread mutexes.

API
       "APR::ThreadMutex" provides the following functions and/or methods:

Unsupported API
       "APR::ThreadMutex" also provides auto-generated Perl interface for a
       few other methods which aren't tested at the moment and therefore their
       API is a subject to change. These methods will be finalized later as a
       need arises. If you want to rely on any of the following methods please
       contact the the mod_perl development mailing list so we can help each
       other take the steps necessary to shift the method to an officially
       supported API.

   "DESTROY"
       META: Autogenerated - needs to be reviewed/completed

       Destroy the mutex and free the memory associated with the lock.

	 $mutex-&gtDESTROY();

       obj: $mutex ( "APR::ThreadMutex object" )
	   the mutex to destroy.

       ret: no return value
       since: subject to change

   "lock"
       META: Autogenerated - needs to be reviewed/completed

       Acquire the lock for the given mutex. If the mutex is already locked,
       the current thread will be put to sleep until the lock becomes
       available.

	 $ret = $mutex-&gtlock();

       obj: $mutex ( "APR::ThreadMutex object" )
	   the mutex on which to acquire the lock.

       ret: $ret ( integer )
       since: subject to change

   "new"
       Create a new mutex

	 my $mutex = APR::ThreadMutex-&gtnew($p);

       obj: "APR::ThreadMutex" ( class name )
       arg1: $p ( "APR::Pool object" )
       ret: $mutex ( "APR::ThreadMutex object" )
       since: subject to change

   "pool_get"
       META: Autogenerated - needs to be reviewed/completed

       META: should probably be renamed to pool(), like all other pool
       accessors

       Get the pool used by this thread_mutex.

	 $ret = $obj-&gtpool_get();

       obj: $obj ( "APR::ThreadMutex object" )
       ret: $ret ( "APR::Pool object" )
	   apr_pool_t the pool

       since: subject to change

   "trylock"
       META: Autogenerated - needs to be reviewed/completed

       Attempt to acquire the lock for the given mutex. If the mutex has
       already been acquired, the call returns immediately with APR_EBUSY.
       Note: it is important that the APR_STATUS_IS_EBUSY(s) macro be used to
       determine if the return value was APR_EBUSY, for portability reasons.

	 $ret = $mutex-&gttrylock();

       obj: $mutex ( "APR::ThreadMutex object" )
	   the mutex on which to attempt the lock acquiring.

       ret: $ret (integer)
       since: subject to change

   "unlock"
       META: Autogenerated - needs to be reviewed/completed

       Release the lock for the given mutex.

	 $ret = $mutex-&gtunlock();

       obj: $mutex ( "APR::ThreadMutex object" )
	   the mutex from which to release the lock.

       ret: $ret ( integer )
       since: subject to change
