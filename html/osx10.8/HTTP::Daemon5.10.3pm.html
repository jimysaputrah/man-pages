DESCRIPTION
       Instances of the "HTTP::Daemon" class are HTTP/1.1 servers that listen
       on a socket for incoming requests. The "HTTP::Daemon" is a subclass of
       "IO::Socket::INET", so you can perform socket operations directly on it
       too.

       The accept() method will return when a connection from a client is
       available.  The returned value will be an "HTTP::Daemon::ClientConn"
       object which is another "IO::Socket::INET" subclass.  Calling the
       get_request() method on this object will read data from the client and
       return an "HTTP::Request" object.  The ClientConn object also provide
       methods to send back various responses.

       This HTTP daemon does not fork(2) for you.  Your application, i.e. the
       user of the "HTTP::Daemon" is responsible for forking if that is
       desirable.  Also note that the user is responsible for generating
       responses that conform to the HTTP/1.1 protocol.

       The following methods of "HTTP::Daemon" are new (or enhanced) relative
       to the "IO::Socket::INET" base class:

       $d = HTTP::Daemon-&gtnew
       $d = HTTP::Daemon-&gtnew( %opts )
	   The constructor method takes the same arguments as the
	   "IO::Socket::INET" constructor, but unlike its base class it can
	   also be called without any arguments.  The daemon will then set up
	   a listen queue of 5 connections and allocate some random port
	   number.

	   A server that wants to bind to some specific address on the
	   standard HTTP port will be constructed like this:

	     $d = HTTP::Daemon-&gtnew(
		      LocalAddr =&gt 'www.thisplace.com',
		      LocalPort =&gt 80,
		  );

	   See IO::Socket::INET for a description of other arguments that can
	   be used configure the daemon during construction.

       $c = $d-&gtaccept
       $c = $d-&gtaccept( $pkg )
       ($c, $peer_addr) = $d-&gtaccept
	   This method works the same the one provided by the base class, but
	   it returns an "HTTP::Daemon::ClientConn" reference by default.  If
	   a package name is provided as argument, then the returned object
	   will be blessed into the given class.  It is probably a good idea
	   to make that class a subclass of "HTTP::Daemon::ClientConn".

	   The accept method will return "undef" if timeouts have been enabled
	   and no connection is made within the given time.  The timeout()
	   method is described in IO::Socket.

	   In list context both the client object and the peer address will be
	   returned; see the description of the accept method IO::Socket for
	   details.

       $d-&gturl
	   Returns a URL string that can be used to access the server root.

       $d-&gtproduct_tokens
	   Returns the name that this server will use to identify itself.
	   This is the string that is sent with the "Server" response header.
	   The main reason to have this method is that subclasses can override
	   it if they want to use another product name.

	   The default is the string "libwww-perl-daemon/#.##" where "#.##" is
	   replaced with the version number of this module.

       The "HTTP::Daemon::ClientConn" is a "IO::Socket::INET" subclass.
       Instances of this class are returned by the accept() method of
       "HTTP::Daemon".	The following methods are provided:

       $c-&gtget_request
       $c-&gtget_request( $headers_only )
	   This method reads data from the client and turns it into an
	   "HTTP::Request" object which is returned.  It returns "undef" if
	   reading fails.  If it fails, then the "HTTP::Daemon::ClientConn"
	   object ($c) should be discarded, and you should not try call this
	   method again on it.	The $c-&gtreason method might give you some
	   information about why $c-&gtget_request failed.

	   The get_request() method will normally not return until the whole
	   request has been received from the client.  This might not be what
	   you want if the request is an upload of a large file (and with
	   chunked transfer encoding HTTP can even support infinite request
	   messages - uploading live audio for instance).  If you pass a TRUE
	   value as the $headers_only argument, then get_request() will return
	   immediately after parsing the request headers and you are
	   responsible for reading the rest of the request content.  If you
	   are going to call $c-&gtget_request again on the same connection you
	   better read the correct number of bytes.

       $c-&gtread_buffer
       $c-&gtread_buffer( $new_value )
	   Bytes read by $c-&gtget_request, but not used are placed in the read
	   buffer.  The next time $c-&gtget_request is called it will consume
	   the bytes in this buffer before reading more data from the network
	   connection itself.  The read buffer is invalid after
	   $c-&gtget_request has failed.

	   If you handle the reading of the request content yourself you need
	   to empty this buffer before you read more and you need to place
	   unconsumed bytes here.  You also need this buffer if you implement
	   services like 101 Switching Protocols.

	   This method always returns the old buffer content and can
	   optionally replace the buffer content if you pass it an argument.

       $c-&gtreason
	   When $c-&gtget_request returns "undef" you can obtain a short string
	   describing why it happened by calling $c-&gtreason.

       $c-&gtproto_ge( $proto )
	   Return TRUE if the client announced a protocol with version number
	   greater or equal to the given argument.  The $proto argument can be
	   a string like "HTTP/1.1" or just "1.1".

       $c-&gtantique_client
	   Return TRUE if the client speaks the HTTP/0.9 protocol.  No status
	   code and no headers should be returned to such a client.  This
	   should be the same as !$c-&gtproto_ge("HTTP/1.0").

       $c-&gthead_request
	   Return TRUE if the last request was a "HEAD" request.  No content
	   body must be generated for these requests.

       $c-&gtforce_last_request
	   Make sure that $c-&gtget_request will not try to read more requests
	   off this connection.  If you generate a response that is not self
	   delimiting, then you should signal this fact by calling this
	   method.

	   This attribute is turned on automatically if the client announces
	   protocol HTTP/1.0 or worse and does not include a "Connection:
	   Keep-Alive" header.	It is also turned on automatically when
	   HTTP/1.1 or better clients send the "Connection: close" request
	   header.

       $c-&gtsend_status_line
       $c-&gtsend_status_line( $code )
       $c-&gtsend_status_line( $code, $mess )
       $c-&gtsend_status_line( $code, $mess, $proto )
	   Send the status line back to the client.  If $code is omitted 200
	   is assumed.	If $mess is omitted, then a message corresponding to
	   $code is inserted.  If $proto is missing the content of the
	   $HTTP::Daemon::PROTO variable is used.

       $c-&gtsend_crlf
	   Send the CRLF sequence to the client.

       $c-&gtsend_basic_header
       $c-&gtsend_basic_header( $code )
       $c-&gtsend_basic_header( $code, $mess )
       $c-&gtsend_basic_header( $code, $mess, $proto )
	   Send the status line and the "Date:" and "Server:" headers back to
	   the client.	This header is assumed to be continued and does not
	   end with an empty CRLF line.

	   See the description of send_status_line() for the description of
	   the accepted arguments.

       $c-&gtsend_header( $field, $value )
       $c-&gtsend_header( $field1, $value1, $field2, $value2, ... )
	   Send one or more header lines.

       $c-&gtsend_response( $res )
	   Write a "HTTP::Response" object to the client as a response.  We
	   try hard to make sure that the response is self delimiting so that
	   the connection can stay persistent for further request/response
	   exchanges.

	   The content attribute of the "HTTP::Response" object can be a
	   normal string or a subroutine reference.  If it is a subroutine,
	   then whatever this callback routine returns is written back to the
	   client as the response content.  The routine will be called until
	   it return an undefined or empty value.  If the client is HTTP/1.1
	   aware then we will use chunked transfer encoding for the response.

       $c-&gtsend_redirect( $loc )
       $c-&gtsend_redirect( $loc, $code )
       $c-&gtsend_redirect( $loc, $code, $entity_body )
	   Send a redirect response back to the client.  The location ($loc)
	   can be an absolute or relative URL. The $code must be one the
	   redirect status codes, and defaults to "301 Moved Permanently"

       $c-&gtsend_error
       $c-&gtsend_error( $code )
       $c-&gtsend_error( $code, $error_message )
	   Send an error response back to the client.  If the $code is missing
	   a "Bad Request" error is reported.  The $error_message is a string
	   that is incorporated in the body of the HTML entity body.

       $c-&gtsend_file_response( $filename )
	   Send back a response with the specified $filename as content.  If
	   the file is a directory we try to generate an HTML index of it.

       $c-&gtsend_file( $filename )
       $c-&gtsend_file( $fd )
	   Copy the file to the client.  The file can be a string (which will
	   be interpreted as a filename) or a reference to an "IO::Handle" or
	   glob.

       $c-&gtdaemon
	   Return a reference to the corresponding "HTTP::Daemon" object.
