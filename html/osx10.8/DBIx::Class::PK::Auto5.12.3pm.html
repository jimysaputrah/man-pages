NAME
       DBIx::Class::PK::Auto - Automatic primary key class

SYNOPSIS
       use base 'DBIx::Class::Core'; __PACKAGE__->set_primary_key('id');

DESCRIPTION
       This class overrides the insert method to get automatically incremented
       primary keys.

       PK::Auto is now part of Core.

       See DBIx::Class::Manual::Component for details of component
       interactions.

LOGIC
       "PK::Auto" does this by letting the database assign the primary key
       field and fetching the assigned value afterwards.

METHODS
   insert
       The code that was handled here is now in Row for efficiency.

   sequence
       The code that was handled here is now in ResultSource, and is being
       proxied to Row as well.
