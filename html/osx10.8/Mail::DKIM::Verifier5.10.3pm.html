NAME
       Mail::DKIM::Verifier - verifies a DKIM-signed message

SYNOPSIS
	 use Mail::DKIM::Verifier;

	 # create a verifier object
	 my $dkim = Mail::DKIM::Verifier->new();

	 # read an email from a file handle
	 $dkim->load(*STDIN);

	 # or read an email and pass it into the verifier, incrementally
	 while (<STDIN>)
	 {
	     # remove local line terminators
	     chomp;
	     s/\015$//;

	     # use SMTP line terminators
	     $dkim->PRINT("$_\015\012");
	 }
	 $dkim->CLOSE;

	 # what is the result of the verify?
	 my $result = $dkim->result;

	 # there might be multiple signatures, what is the result per signature?
	 foreach my $signature ($dkim->signatures)
	 {
	     print "signature identity: " . $signature->identity . "\n";
	     print "verify result: " . $signature->result_detail . "\n";
	 }

	 # the alleged author of the email may specify how to handle email
	 foreach my $policy ($dkim->policies)
	 {
	     die "fraudulent message" if ($policy->apply($dkim) eq "reject");
	 }

DESCRIPTION
       The verifier object allows an email message to be scanned for DKIM and
       DomainKeys signatures and those signatures to be verified. The verifier
       tracks the state of the message as it is read into memory. When the
       message has been completely read, the signatures are verified and the
       results of the verification can be accessed.

       To use the verifier, first create the verifier object. Then start
       "feeding" it the email message to be verified. When all the _headers_
       have been read, the verifier:

	1. checks whether any DomainKeys/DKIM signatures were found
	2. queries for the public keys needed to verify the signatures
	3. sets up the appropriate algorithms and canonicalization objects
	4. canonicalizes the headers and computes the header hash

       Then, when the _body_ of the message has been completely fed into the
       verifier, the body hash is computed and the signatures are verified.

       The results of the verification can be checked with "result()" or
       "signatures()".

       Messages that do not verify may be checked against the alleged sender's
       published signing policy with "policies()" and "apply()" in
       Mail::DKIM::Policy.

CONSTRUCTOR
   new()
       Constructs an object-oriented verifier.

	 my $dkim = Mail::DKIM::Verifier->new();

	 my $dkim = Mail::DKIM::Verifier->new(%options);

       The only option supported at this time is:

       Debug_Canonicalization
	   if specified, the canonicalized message for the first signature is
	   written to the referenced string or file handle.

METHODS
   PRINT()
       Feeds part of the message to the verifier.

	 $dkim->PRINT("a line of the message\015\012");
	 $dkim->PRINT("more of");
	 $dkim->PRINT(" the message\015\012bye\015\012");

       Feeds content of the message being verified into the verifier.  The API
       is designed this way so that the entire message does NOT need to be
       read into memory at once.

       Please note that although the PRINT() method expects you to use SMTP-
       style line termination characters, you should NOT use the SMTP-style
       dot-stuffing technique described in RFC 2821 section 4.5.2.  Nor should
       you use a <CR><LF>.<CR><LF> sequence to terminate the message.

   CLOSE()
       Call this when finished feeding in the message.

	 $dkim->CLOSE;

       This method finishes the canonicalization process, computes a hash, and
       verifies the signature.

   fetch_author_domain_policies()
       Retrieves ADSP records from DNS.

	 my @policies = $dkim->fetch_author_domain_policies;
	 foreach my $policy (@policies)
	 {
	     my $policy_result = $policy->apply($dkim);
	 }

       This method will retrieve all applicable "author-domain-signing-
       practices" published in DNS for this message.  Author policies are
       keyed to the email address(es) in the From: header, i.e. the claimed
       author of the message.

       This method returns a *list* of policy records, since there is allowed
       to be zero or multiple email addresses in the From: header.

       The result of the apply() method is one of: "accept", "reject",
       "neutral".

       See also: "policies()".

   fetch_author_policy()
       Retrieves a signing policy from DNS.

	 my $policy = $dkim->fetch_author_policy;
	 my $policy_result = $policy->apply($dkim);

       This method retrieves the DKIM Sender Signing Practices record as
       described in Internet Draft draft-ietf-dkim-ssp-00-01dc.  This Internet
       Draft is now obsolete; this method is only kept for backward-
       compatibility purposes.

       Please use the "policies()" method instead.

   fetch_sender_policy()
       Retrieves a signing policy from DNS.

	 my $policy = $dkim->fetch_sender_policy;
	 my $policy_result = $policy->apply($dkim);

       The "sender" policy is the sender signing policy as described by the
       DomainKeys specification, now available in RFC4870(historical).	I call
       it the "sender" policy because it is keyed to the email address in the
       Sender: header, or the From: header if there is no Sender header.  This
       is the person whom the message claims as the "transmitter" of the
       message (not necessarily the author).

       If the email being verified has no From or Sender header from which to
       get an email address (which violates email standards), then this method
       will "die".

       The result of the apply() method is one of: "accept", "reject",
       "neutral".

       See also: "policies()".

   load()
       Load the entire message from a file handle.

	 $dkim->load($file_handle);

       Reads a complete message from the designated file handle, feeding it
       into the verifier. The message must use <CRLF> line terminators (same
       as the SMTP protocol).

   message_originator()
       Access the "From" header.

	 my $address = $dkim->message_originator;

       Returns the "originator address" found in the message, as a
       Mail::Address object.  This is typically the (first) name and email
       address found in the From: header. If there is no From: header, then an
       empty Mail::Address object is returned.

       To get just the email address part, do:

	 my $email = $dkim->message_originator->address;

       See also "message_sender()".

   message_sender()
       Access the "From" or "Sender" header.

	 my $address = $dkim->message_sender;

       Returns the "sender" found in the message, as a Mail::Address object.
       This is typically the (first) name and email address found in the
       Sender: header. If there is no Sender: header, it is the first name and
       email address in the From: header. If neither header is present, then
       an empty Mail::Address object is returned.

       To get just the email address part, do:

	 my $email = $dkim->message_sender->address;

       The "sender" is the mailbox of the agent responsible for the actual
       transmission of the message. For example, if a secretary were to send a
       message for another person, the "sender" would be the secretary and the
       "originator" would be the actual author.

   policies()
       Retrieves applicable signing policies from DNS.

	 my @policies = $dkim->policies;
	 foreach my $policy (@policies)
	 {
	     $policy_result = $policy->apply($dkim);
	     # $policy_result is one of "accept", "reject", "neutral"
	 }

       This method searches for and returns any signing policies that would
       apply to this message. Signing policies are selected based on the
       domain that the message *claims* to be from. So, for example, if a
       message claims to be from security@bank, and forwarded by
       trusted@listserv, when in reality the message came from foe@evilcorp,
       this method would check for signing policies for security@bank and
       trusted@listserv. The signing policies might tell whether foe@evilcorp
       (the real sender) is allowed to send mail claiming to be from your bank
       or your listserv.

       I say "might tell", because in reality this is still really hard to
       specify with any accuracy. In addition, most senders do not publish
       useful policies.

   result()
       Access the result of the verification.

	 my $result = $dkim->result;

       Gives the result of the verification. The following values are
       possible:

       pass
	   Returned if a valid DKIM-Signature header was found, and the
	   signature contains a correct value for the message.

       fail
	   Returned if a valid DKIM-Signature header was found, but the
	   signature does not contain a correct value for the message.

       invalid
	   Returned if a DKIM-Signature could not be checked because of a
	   problem in the signature itself or the public key record. I.e. the
	   signature could not be processed.

       temperror
	   Returned if a DKIM-Signature could not be checked due to some error
	   which is likely transient in nature, such as a temporary inability
	   to retrieve a public key. A later attempt may produce a better
	   result.

       none
	   Returned if no DKIM-Signature headers (valid or invalid) were
	   found.

       In case of multiple signatures, the "best" result will be returned.
       Best is defined as "pass", followed by "fail", "invalid", and "none".
       To examine the results of individual signatures, use the "signatures()"
       method to retrieve the signature objects. See "result()" in
       Mail::DKIM::Signature.

   result_detail()
       Access the result, plus details if available.

	 my $detail = $dkim->result_detail;

       The detail is constructed by taking the result (e.g. "pass", "fail",
       "invalid" or "none") and appending any details provided by the
       verification process in parenthesis.

       The following are possible results from the result_detail() method:

	 pass
	 fail (bad RSA signature)
	 fail (OpenSSL error: ...)
	 fail (message has been altered)
	 fail (body has been altered)
	 invalid (bad identity)
	 invalid (invalid domain in d tag)
	 invalid (missing q tag)
	 invalid (missing d tag)
	 invalid (missing s tag)
	 invalid (unsupported version 0.1)
	 invalid (unsupported algorithm ...)
	 invalid (unsupported canonicalization ...)
	 invalid (unsupported query protocol ...)
	 invalid (signature is expired)
	 invalid (public key: not available)
	 invalid (public key: unknown query type ...)
	 invalid (public key: syntax error)
	 invalid (public key: unsupported version)
	 invalid (public key: unsupported key type)
	 invalid (public key: missing p= tag)
	 invalid (public key: invalid data)
	 invalid (public key: does not support email)
	 invalid (public key: does not support hash algorithm 'sha1')
	 invalid (public key: does not support signing subdomains)
	 invalid (public key: revoked)
	 invalid (public key: granularity mismatch)
	 invalid (public key: granularity is empty)
	 invalid (public key: OpenSSL error: ...)
	 none

   signature()
       Access the message's DKIM signature.

	 my $sig = $dkim->signature;

       Accesses the signature found and verified in this message. The returned
       object is of type Mail::DKIM::Signature.

       In case of multiple signatures, the signature with the "best" result
       will be returned.  Best is defined as "pass", followed by "fail",
       "invalid", and "none".

   signatures()
       Access all of this message's signatures.

	 my @all_signatures = $dkim->signatures;

       Use $signature->result or $signature->result_detail to access the
       verification results of each signature.
