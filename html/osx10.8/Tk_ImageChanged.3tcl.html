DESCRIPTION
       An  image  manager calls Tk_ImageChanged for an image whenever anything
       happens that requires the image to be redrawn.  As a result of  calling
       Tk_ImageChanged,  any widgets using the image are notified so that they
       can redisplay themselves appropriately.	The imageMaster argument iden-
       tifies  the  image,  and  x, y, width, and height specify a rectangular
       region within the image that  needs  to	be  redrawn.   imageWidth  and
       imageHeight specify the image's (new) size.

       An  image  manager should call Tk_ImageChanged during its createProc to
       specify the image's initial size and to force redisplay	if  there  are
       existing  instances  for  the image.  If any of the pixel values in the
       image should change later on, Tk_ImageChanged should  be  called  again
       with  x,  y,  width,  and  height values that cover all the pixels that
       changed.  If the size of the image should change, then  Tk_ImageChanged
       must  be  called to indicate the new size, even if no pixels need to be
       redisplayed.
