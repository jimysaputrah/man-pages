NAME
       Package::Stash - routines for manipulating stashes

VERSION
       version 0.33

SYNOPSIS
	 my $stash = Package::Stash-&gtnew('Foo');
	 $stash-&gtadd_symbol('%foo', {bar =&gt 1});
	 # $Foo::foo{bar} == 1
	 $stash-&gthas_symbol('$foo') # false
	 my $namespace = $stash-&gtnamespace;
	 *{ $namespace-&gt{foo} }{HASH} # {bar =&gt 1}

DESCRIPTION
       Manipulating stashes (Perl's symbol tables) is occasionally necessary,
       but incredibly messy, and easy to get wrong. This module hides all of
       that behind a simple API.

       NOTE: Most methods in this class require a variable specification that
       includes a sigil. If this sigil is absent, it is assumed to represent
       the IO slot.

       Due to limitations in the typeglob API available to perl code, and to
       typeglob manipulation in perl being quite slow, this module provides
       two implementations - one in pure perl, and one using XS. The XS
       implementation is to be preferred for most usages; the pure perl one is
       provided for cases where XS modules are not a possibility. The current
       implementation in use can be set by setting
       $ENV{PACKAGE_STASH_IMPLEMENTATION} or $Package::Stash::IMPLEMENTATION
       before loading Package::Stash (with the environment variable taking
       precedence), otherwise, it will use the XS implementation if possible,
       falling back to the pure perl one.

METHODS
   new $package_name
       Creates a new "Package::Stash" object, for the package given as the
       only argument.

   name
       Returns the name of the package that this object represents.

   namespace
       Returns the raw stash itself.

   add_symbol $variable $value %opts
       Adds a new package symbol, for the symbol given as $variable, and
       optionally gives it an initial value of $value. $variable should be the
       name of variable including the sigil, so

	 Package::Stash-&gtnew('Foo')-&gtadd_symbol('%foo')

       will create %Foo::foo.

       Valid options (all optional) are "filename", "first_line_num", and
       "last_line_num".

       $opts{filename}, $opts{first_line_num}, and $opts{last_line_num} can be
       used to indicate where the symbol should be regarded as having been
       defined.  Currently these values are only used if the symbol is a
       subroutine ('"&"' sigil) and only if "$^P & 0x10" is true, in which
       case the special %DB::sub hash is updated to record the values of
       "filename", "first_line_num", and "last_line_num" for the subroutine.
       If these are not passed, their values are inferred (as much as
       possible) from "caller" information.

       This is especially useful for debuggers and profilers, which use
       %DB::sub to determine where the source code for a subroutine can be
       found.  See http://perldoc.perl.org/perldebguts.html#Debugger-Internals
       &lthttp://perldoc.perl.org/perldebguts.html#Debugger-Internals&gt for more
       information about %DB::sub.

   remove_glob $name
       Removes all package variables with the given name, regardless of sigil.

   has_symbol $variable
       Returns whether or not the given package variable (including sigil)
       exists.

   get_symbol $variable
       Returns the value of the given package variable (including sigil).

   get_or_add_symbol $variable
       Like "get_symbol", except that it will return an empty hashref or
       arrayref if the variable doesn't exist.

   remove_symbol $variable
       Removes the package variable described by $variable (which includes the
       sigil); other variables with the same name but different sigils will be
       untouched.

   list_all_symbols $type_filter
       Returns a list of package variable names in the package, without
       sigils. If a "type_filter" is passed, it is used to select package
       variables of a given type, where valid types are the slots of a
       typeglob ('SCALAR', 'CODE', 'HASH', etc). Note that if the package
       contained any "BEGIN" blocks, perl will leave an empty typeglob in the
       "BEGIN" slot, so this will show up if no filter is used (and similarly
       for "INIT", "END", etc).

   get_all_symbols $type_filter
       Returns a hashref, keyed by the variable names in the package. If
       $type_filter is passed, the hash will contain every variable of that
       type in the package as values, otherwise, it will contain the typeglobs
       corresponding to the variable names (basically, a clone of the stash).

BUGS / CAVEATS
       o   Prior to perl 5.10, scalar slots are only considered to exist if
	   they are defined

	   This is due to a shortcoming within perl itself. See "Making
	   References" in perlref point 7 for more information.

       o   GLOB and FORMAT variables are not (yet) accessible through this
	   module.

       o   Also, see the BUGS section for the specific backends
	   (Package::Stash::XS and Package::Stash::PP)
