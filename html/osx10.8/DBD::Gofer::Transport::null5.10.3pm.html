NAME
       DBD::Gofer::Transport::null - DBD::Gofer client transport for testing

SYNOPSIS
	 my $original_dsn = "..."
	 DBI-&gtconnect("dbi:Gofer:transport=null;dsn=$original_dsn",...)

       or, enable by setting the DBI_AUTOPROXY environment variable:

	 export DBI_AUTOPROXY="dbi:Gofer:transport=null"

DESCRIPTION
       Connect via DBD::Gofer but execute the requests within the same
       process.

       This is a quick and simple way to test applications for compatibility
       with the (few) restrictions that DBD::Gofer imposes.

       It also provides a simple, portable way for the DBI test suite to be
       used to test DBD::Gofer on all platforms with no setup.

       Also, by measuring the difference in performance between normal
       connections and connections via "dbi:Gofer:transport=null" the basic
       cost of using DBD::Gofer can be measured. Furthermore, the additional
       cost of more advanced transports can be isolated by comparing their
       performance with the null transport.

       The "t/85gofer.t" script in the DBI distribution includes a comparative
       benchmark.
