NAME
       glRotated, glRotatef - multiply the current matrix by a rotation matrix


C SPECIFICATION
       void glRotated( GLdouble angle,
		       GLdouble x,
		       GLdouble y,
		       GLdouble z )
       void glRotatef( GLfloat angle,
		       GLfloat x,
		       GLfloat y,
		       GLfloat z )


PARAMETERS
       angle  Specifies the angle of rotation, in degrees.

       x, y, z
	      Specify the x, y, and z coordinates of a vector, respectively.

DESCRIPTION
       glRotate produces a rotation of angle degrees around the vector (x,  y,
       z).   The current matrix (see glMatrixMode) is multiplied by a rotation
       matrix  with  the  product  replacing  the  current   matrix,   as   if
       glMultMatrix were called with the following matrix as its argument:


	 x^2(1-c)+c	xy(1-c)-zs     xz(1-c)+ys     0
	 yx(1-c)+zs	y^2(1-c)+c     yz(1-c)-xs     0
	 xz(1-c)-ys	yz(1-c)+xs     z^2(1-c)+c     0
	      0 	     0		     0	      1



       Where  c = cos (angle), s = sin (angle), and ||(x, y, z)|| = 1 (if not,
       the GL will normalize this vector).



       If the matrix mode is either GL_MODELVIEW or GL_PROJECTION, all objects
       drawn  after  glRotate  is  called  are	rotated.  Use glPushMatrix and
       glPopMatrix to save and restore the unrotated coordinate system.

NOTES
       This rotation follows the right-hand rule, so if the vector (x,	y,  z)
       points toward the user, the rotation will be counterclockwise.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_OPERATION  is  generated if glRotate is executed between the
       execution of glBegin and the corresponding execution of glEnd.
