NAME
       glGetShaderInfoLog - Returns the information log for a shader object

C SPECIFICATION
       void glGetShaderInfoLog(GLuint shader, GLsizei maxLength,
			       GLsizei *length, GLchar *infoLog);

PARAMETERS
       shader
	   Specifies the shader object whose information log is to be queried.

       maxLength
	   Specifies the size of the character buffer for storing the returned
	   information log.

       length
	   Returns the length of the string returned in infoLog (excluding the
	   null terminator).

       infoLog
	   Specifies an array of characters that is used to return the
	   information log.

DESCRIPTION
       glGetShaderInfoLog returns the information log for the specified shader
       object. The information log for a shader object is modified when the
       shader is compiled. The string that is returned will be null
       terminated.

       glGetShaderInfoLog returns in infoLog as much of the information log as
       it can, up to a maximum of maxLength characters. The number of
       characters actually returned, excluding the null termination character,
       is specified by length. If the length of the returned string is not
       required, a value of NULL can be passed in the length argument. The
       size of the buffer required to store the returned information log can
       be obtained by calling glGetShader() with the value GL_INFO_LOG_LENGTH.

       The information log for a shader object is a string that may contain
       diagnostic messages, warning messages, and other information about the
       last compile operation. When a shader object is created, its
       information log will be a string of length 0.

NOTES
       The information log for a shader object is the OpenGL implementer's
       primary mechanism for conveying information about the compilation
       process. Therefore, the information log can be helpful to application
       developers during the development process, even when compilation is
       successful. Application developers should not expect different OpenGL
       implementations to produce identical information logs.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if shader is not a value generated by
       OpenGL.

       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if shader is not a shader object.

       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if maxLength is less than 0.

ASSOCIATED GETS
       glGetShader() with argument GL_INFO_LOG_LENGTH

       glIsShader()
