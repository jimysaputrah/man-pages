NAME
       Term::ReadKey - A perl module for simple terminal control

SYNOPSIS
	       use Term::ReadKey;
	       ReadMode 4; # Turn off controls keys
	       while (not defined ($key = ReadKey(-1))) {
		       # No key yet
	       }
	       print "Get key $key\n";
	       ReadMode 0; # Reset tty mode before exiting

DESCRIPTION
       Term::ReadKey is a compiled perl module dedicated to providing simple
       control over terminal driver modes (cbreak, raw, cooked, etc.,) support
       for non-blocking reads, if the architecture allows, and some
       generalized handy functions for working with terminals. One of the main
       goals is to have the functions as portable as possible, so you can just
       plug in "use Term::ReadKey" on any architecture and have a good
       likelyhood of it working.

       ReadMode MODE [, Filehandle]
	       Takes an integer argument, which can currently be one of the
	       following values:

		   0	Restore original settings.
		   1	Change to cooked mode.
		   2	Change to cooked mode with echo off.
			 (Good for passwords)
		   3	Change to cbreak mode.
		   4	Change to raw mode.
		   5	Change to ultra-raw mode.
			 (LF to CR/LF translation turned off)

		   Or, you may use the synonyms:

		   restore
		   normal
		   noecho
		   cbreak
		   raw
		   ultra-raw

	       These functions are automatically applied to the STDIN handle
	       if no other handle is supplied. Modes 0 and 5 have some special
	       properties worth mentioning: not only will mode 0 restore
	       original settings, but it cause the next ReadMode call to save
	       a new set of default settings. Mode 5 is similar to mode 4,
	       except no CR/LF translation is performed, and if possible,
	       parity will be disabled (only if not being used by the
	       terminal, however. It is no different from mode 4 under
	       Windows.)

	       If you are executing another program that may be changing the
	       terminal mode, you will either want to say

		   ReadMode 1
		   system('someprogram');
		   ReadMode 1;

	       which resets the settings after the program has run, or:

		   $somemode=1;
		   ReadMode 0;
		   system('someprogram');
		   ReadMode 1;

	       which records any changes the program may have made, before
	       resetting the mode.

       ReadKey MODE [, Filehandle]
	       Takes an integer argument, which can currently be one of the
	       following values:

		   0	Perform a normal read using getc
		   -1	Perform a non-blocked read
		   >0	Perform a timed read

	       (If the filehandle is not supplied, it will default to STDIN.)
	       If there is nothing waiting in the buffer during a non-blocked
	       read, then undef will be returned. Note that if the OS does not
	       provide any known mechanism for non-blocking reads, then a
	       "ReadKey -1" can die with a fatal error. This will hopefully
	       not be common.

	       If MODE is greater then zero, then ReadKey will use it as a
	       timeout value in seconds (fractional seconds are allowed), and
	       won't return "undef" until that time expires. (Note, again,
	       that some OS's may not support this timeout behaviour.) If MODE
	       is less then zero, then this is treated as a timeout of zero,
	       and thus will return immediately if no character is waiting. A
	       MODE of zero, however, will act like a normal getc.

	       There are currently some limitations with this call under
	       Windows. It may be possible that non-blocking reads will fail
	       when reading repeating keys from more then one console.

       ReadLine MODE [, Filehandle]
	       Takes an integer argument, which can currently be one of the
	       following values:

		   0	Perform a normal read using scalar(<FileHandle>)
		   -1	Perform a non-blocked read
		   >0	Perform a timed read

	       If there is nothing waiting in the buffer during a non-blocked
	       read, then undef will be returned. Note that if the OS does not
	       provide any known mechanism for non-blocking reads, then a
	       "ReadLine 1" can die with a fatal error. This will hopefully
	       not be common. Note that a non-blocking test is only performed
	       for the first character in the line, not the entire line.  This
	       call will probably not do what you assume, especially with
	       ReadMode's higher then 1. For example, pressing Space and then
	       Backspace would appear to leave you where you started, but any
	       timeouts would now be suspended.

	       This call is currently not available under Windows.

       GetTerminalSize [Filehandle]
	       Returns either an empty array if this operation is unsupported,
	       or a four element array containing: the width of the terminal
	       in characters, the height of the terminal in character, the
	       width in pixels, and the height in pixels. (The pixel size will
	       only be valid in some environments.)

	       Under Windows, this function must be called with an "output"
	       filehandle, such as STDOUT, or a handle opened to CONOUT$.

       SetTerminalSize WIDTH,HEIGHT,XPIX,YPIX [, Filehandle]
	       Return -1 on failure, 0 otherwise. Note that this terminal size
	       is only for informative value, and changing the size via this
	       mechanism will not change the size of the screen. For example,
	       XTerm uses a call like this when it resizes the screen. If any
	       of the new measurements vary from the old, the OS will probably
	       send a SIGWINCH signal to anything reading that tty or pty.

	       This call does not work under Windows.

       GetSpeeds [, Filehandle]
	       Returns either an empty array if the operation is unsupported,
	       or a two value array containing the terminal in and out speeds,
	       in decimal. E.g, an in speed of 9600 baud and an out speed of
	       4800 baud would be returned as (9600,4800). Note that currently
	       the in and out speeds will always be identical in some OS's. No
	       speeds are reported under Windows.

       GetControlChars [, Filehandle]
	       Returns an array containing key/value pairs suitable for a
	       hash. The pairs consist of a key, the name of the control
	       character/signal, and the value of that character, as a single
	       character. This call does nothing under Windows.

	       Each key will be an entry from the following list:

		       DISCARD
		       DSUSPEND
		       EOF
		       EOL
		       EOL2
		       ERASE
		       ERASEWORD
		       INTERRUPT
		       KILL
		       MIN
		       QUIT
		       QUOTENEXT
		       REPRINT
		       START
		       STATUS
		       STOP
		       SUSPEND
		       SWITCH
		       TIME

	       Thus, the following will always return the current interrupt
	       character, regardless of platform.

		       %keys = GetControlChars;
		       $int = $keys{INTERRUPT};

       SetControlChars [, Filehandle]
	       Takes an array containing key/value pairs, as a hash will
	       produce. The pairs should consist of a key that is the name of
	       a legal control character/signal, and the value should be
	       either a single character, or a number in the range 0-255.
	       SetControlChars will die with a runtime error if an invalid
	       character name is passed or there is an error changing the
	       settings. The list of valid names is easily available via

		       %cchars = GetControlChars();
		       @cnames = keys %cchars;

	       This call does nothing under Windows.
