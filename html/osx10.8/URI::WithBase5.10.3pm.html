URI::WithBase(3)      User Contributed Perl Documentation     URI::WithBase(3)



NAME
       URI::WithBase - URIs which remember their base

SYNOPSIS
	$u1 = URI::WithBase-&gtnew($str, $base);
	$u2 = $u1-&gtabs;

	$base = $u1-&gtbase;
	$u1-&gtbase( $new_base )

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides the "URI::WithBase" class.	Objects of this class
       are like "URI" objects, but can keep their base too.  The base
       represents the context where this URI was found and can be used to
       absolutize or relativize the URI.  All the methods described in URI are
       supported for "URI::WithBase" objects.

       The methods provided in addition to or modified from those of "URI"
       are:

       $uri = URI::WithBase-&gtnew($str, [$base])
	   The constructor takes an optional base URI as the second argument.
	   If provided, this argument initializes the base attribute.

       $uri-&gtbase( [$new_base] )
	   Can be used to get or set the value of the base attribute.  The
	   return value, which is the old value, is a URI object or "undef".

       $uri-&gtabs( [$base_uri] )
	   The $base_uri argument is now made optional as the object carries
	   its base with it.  A new object is returned even if $uri is already
	   absolute (while plain URI objects simply return themselves in that
	   case).

       $uri-&gtrel( [$base_uri] )
	   The $base_uri argument is now made optional as the object carries
	   its base with it.  A new object is always returned.
