AU_CONTROL(3)		 BSD Library Functions Manual		 AU_CONTROL(3)

NAME
     setac, endac, getacdir, getacmin, getacexpire, getacfilesz, getacflg,
     getacna, getacpol, au_poltostr, au_strtopol -- look up information from
     the audit_control database

LIBRARY
     Basic Security Module Library (libbsm, -lbsm)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <bsm/libbsm.h>

     void
     setac(void);

     void
     endac(void);

     int
     getacdir(char *name, int len);

     int
     getacmin(int *min_val);

     int
     getacexpire(int *andflg, time_t *age, size_t *size);

     int
     getacfilesz(size_t *size_val);

     int
     getacflg(char *auditstr, int len);

     int
     getacna(char *auditstr, int len);

     int
     getacpol(char *auditstr, size_t len);

     ssize_t
     au_poltostr(int policy, size_t maxsize, char *buf);

     int
     au_strtopol(const char *polstr, int *policy);

DESCRIPTION
     These interfaces may be used to look up information from the
     audit_control(5) database, which contains various audit-related adminis-
     trative parameters.

     The setac() function resets the database iterator to the beginning of the
     database; see the BUGS section for more information.

     The endac() function closes the audit_control(5) database.

     The getacdir() function returns the name of the directory where log data
     is stored via the passed character buffer name of length len.

     The getacmin() function returns the minimum free disk space for the audit
     log target file system via the passed min_val variable.

     The getacexpire() function returns the audit trail file expiration param-
     eters in the passed int buffer andflg, time_t buffer age and size_t
     buffer size.  If the parameter is not specified in the audit_control(5)
     file it is set to zero.

     The getacfilesz() function returns the audit trail rotation size in the
     passed size_t buffer size_val.

     The getacflg() function returns the audit system flags via the the passed
     character buffer auditstr of length len.

     The getacna() function returns the non-attributable flags via the passed
     character buffer auditstr of length len.

     The getacpol() function returns the audit policy flags via the passed
     character buffer auditstr of length len.

     The au_poltostr() function converts a numeric audit policy mask, policy,
     to a string in the passed character buffer buf of lenth maxsize.

     The au_strtopol() function converts an audit policy flags string, polstr,
     to a numeric audit policy mask returned via policy.

RETURN VALULES
     The getacdir(), getacmin(), getacexpire(), getacflg(), getacna(),
     getacpol(), and au_strtopol() functions return 0 on success, or a nega-
     tive value on failure, along with error information in errno.

     The au_poltostr() function returns a string length of 0 or more on suc-
     cess, or a negative value on if there is a failure.

     Functions that return a string value will return a failure if there is
     insufficient room in the passed character buffer for the full string.

HISTORY
     The OpenBSM implementation was created by McAfee Research, the security
     division of McAfee Inc., under contract to Apple Computer, Inc., in 2004.
     It was subsequently adopted by the TrustedBSD Project as the foundation
     for the OpenBSM distribution.

AUTHORS
     This software was created by Robert Watson, Wayne Salamon, and Suresh
     Krishnaswamy for McAfee Research, the security research division of
     McAfee, Inc., under contract to Apple Computer, Inc.

     The Basic Security Module (BSM) interface to audit records and audit
     event stream format were defined by Sun Microsystems.

BUGS
     These routines cannot currently distinguish between an entry not being
     found and an error accessing the database.  The implementation should be
     changed to return an error via errno when NULL is returned.

BUGS
     There is no reason for the setac() interface to be exposed as part of the
     public API, as it is called implicitly by other access functions and
     iteration is not supported.

     These interfaces inconsistently return various negative values depending
     on the failure mode, and do not always set errno on failure.
