NAME
       DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::ADO::Microsoft_SQL_Server - Support for
       Microsoft SQL Server via DBD::ADO

SYNOPSIS
       This subclass supports MSSQL server connections via DBD::ADO.

DESCRIPTION
       The MSSQL specific functionality is provided by
       DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::MSSQL.

EXAMPLE DSN
	 dbi:ADO:provider=sqlncli10;server=EEEBOX\SQLEXPRESS

CAVEATS
   identities
       "_identity_method" is set to @@identity, as "SCOPE_IDENTITY()" doesn't
       work with DBD::ADO. See "IMPLEMENTATION NOTES" in
       DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::MSSQL for caveats regarding this.

   truncation bug
       There is a bug with MSSQL ADO providers where data gets truncated based
       on the size of the bind sizes in the first prepare call:

       <https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=52048>

       The "ado_size" workaround is used (see "ADO Providers" in DBD::ADO)
       with the approximate maximum size of the data_type of the bound column,
       or 8000 (maximum VARCHAR size) if the data_type is not available.

       This code is incomplete and may be buggy. Particularly, "VARCHAR(MAX)"
       is not supported yet. The data_type list for other DBs is also
       incomplete. Please report problems (and send patches.)

   fractional seconds
       Fractional seconds with DBIx::Class::InflateColumn::DateTime are not
       currently supported, datetimes are truncated at the second.
