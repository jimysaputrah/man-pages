NAME
       DateTime::TimeZone::Local - Determine the local system's time zone

VERSION
       version 1.41

SYNOPSIS
	 my $tz = DateTime::TimeZone-&gtnew( name =&gt 'local' );

	 my $tz = DateTime::TimeZone::Local-&gtTimeZone();

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides an interface for determining the local system's
       time zone. Most of the functionality for doing this is in OS-specific
       subclasses.

USAGE
       This class provides the following methods:

   DateTime::TimeZone::Local-&gtTimeZone()
       This attempts to load an appropriate subclass and asks it to find the
       local time zone. This method is called by when you pass "local" as the
       time zone name to "DateTime:TimeZone-&gtnew()".

       If your OS is not explicitly handled, you can create a module with a
       name of the form "DateTime::TimeZone::Local::$^O". If it exists, it
       will be used instead of falling back to the Unix subclass.

       If no OS-specific module exists, we fall back to using the Unix
       subclass.

       See DateTime::TimeZone::Local::Unix, DateTime::TimeZone::Local::Win32,
       and DateTime::TimeZone::Local::VMS for OS-specific details.

SUBCLASSING
       If you want to make a new OS-specific subclass, there are several
       methods provided by this module you should know about.

   $class-&gtMethods()
       This method should be provided by your class. It should provide a list
       of methods that will be called to try to determine the local time zone.

       Each of these methods is expected to return a new "DateTime::TimeZone"
       object if it determines the time zone.

   $class-&gtFromEnv()
       This method tries to find a valid time zone in an %ENV value. It calls
       "$class-&gtEnvVars()" to determine which keys to look at.

       To use this from a subclass, simply return "FromEnv" as one of the
       items from "$class-&gtMethods()".

   $class-&gtEnvVars()
       This method should be provided by your subclass. It should return a
       list of env vars to be checked by "$class-&gtFromEnv()".

   $class-&gt_IsValidName($name)
       Given a possible time zone name, this returns a boolean indicating
       whether or not the the name looks valid. It always return false for
       "local" in order to avoid infinite loops.

EXAMPLE SUBCLASS
       Here is a simple example subclass:

	 package DateTime::TimeZone::SomeOS;

	 use strict;
	 use warnings;

	 use base 'DateTime::TimeZone::Local';


	 sub Methods { qw( FromEnv FromEther ) }

	 sub EnvVars { qw( TZ ZONE ) }

	 sub FromEther
	 {
	     my $class = shift;

	     ...
	 }
