DBIx::ClDBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::Sybase::Microsoft_SQL_Server::NoBindVars(3)



NAME
       DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::Sybase::Microsoft_SQL_Server::NoBindVars -
       Support for Microsoft SQL Server via DBD::Sybase without placeholders

SYNOPSIS
       This subclass supports MSSQL server connections via DBD::Sybase when ?
       style placeholders are not available.

DESCRIPTION
       If you are using this driver then your combination of DBD::Sybase and
       libraries (most likely FreeTDS) does not support ? style placeholders.

       This storage driver uses DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::NoBindVars as a
       base.  This means that bind variables will be interpolated (properly
       quoted of course) into the SQL query itself, without using bind
       placeholders.

       More importantly this means that caching of prepared statements is
       explicitly disabled, as the interpolation renders it useless.

       In all other respects, it is a subclass of
       DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::Sybase::Microsoft_SQL_Server.
