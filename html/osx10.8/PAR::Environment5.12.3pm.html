NAME
       PAR::Environment - Index and reference of PAR environment variables

DESCRIPTION
       PAR uses various environment variables both during the building process
       of executables or PAR archives and the use of them. Since the wealth of
       combinations and settings might confuse one or the other (like me),
       this document is intended to document all environment variables which
       PAR uses.

       Wherever I want to refer to the $ENV{FOO} environment hash entry, I
       will usually talk about the "FOO" variable for brevity.

INDEX OF ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       Please note that this is still very, very incomplete! Contributions
       welcome!

       For each variable, there should be a description what it contains, when
       it can be expected to exist (and contain meaningful information), when
       it is sensible to define it yourself, and what effect this has.

       Of course, the description may use examples.

   PAR_0
       If the running program is run from within a PAR archive or pp-produced
       executable, this variable contains the name of the extracted program
       (i.e. .pl file). This is useful of you want to open the source code
       file of the running program.

       For example, if you package a file foo.pl into bar.par and run foo.pl
       with this command

	 par.pl foo.par bar.pl

       then the "PAR_0" variable will contain something like
       "/tmp/par-youser/cache-b175f53eb731da9594e0dde337d66013ddf25a44/495829f0.pl"
       where "youser" is your username and
       "/tmp/par-youser/cache-b175f53eb731da9594e0dde337d66013ddf25a44/" is
       the PAR cache directory ("PAR_TEMP").

       The name of the PAR cache directory can take a number of different
       forms, so use "PAR_0" if you want to find the extracted program's .pl
       file -- attempting to construct the name yourself requires complex
       logic that has already produced the value in "PAR_0".

       This works the same for executable binaries (.exe, ...).

       If you are looking for the name and path of the pp-ed binary file,
       please refer to the "PAR_PROGNAME" variable.

   PAR_ARGC, PAR_ARGV_0, PAR_ARGV_...
       You should not rely on these variables outside of the PAR binary loader
       code.

       These variables are set when a non-dependent pp-ed binary executable
       runs. The initially executed process extracts another binary and runs
       it as a child process. In order to pass its command line arguments to
       the child, the parent process sets "PAR_ARG*" as they would be used in
       C programs: "PAR_ARGC" has the number of arguments, "PAR_ARGV_0" has
       the name of the executable, "PAR_ARGV_*" are the command line
       arguments.

       If you would like to access the name of the running program (script or
       binary), please refer to "PAR_0" and "PAR_PROGNAME" instead!

       Related: "PAR_SPAWNED", "PAR_0", "PAR_PROGNAME"

   PAR_CLEAN
       Users should set "PAR_GLOBAL_CLEAN" instead.  Recreated from
       "PAR_GLOBAL_CLEAN" and the value of "-C" from the YAML file by the PAR
       loader, and used within loader to control the initial behavior of
       extraction, and the final behavior of cleanup.  The user can reference
       "PAR_CLEAN" in the application to determine which of these behaviors is
       being used for this run of the application.

   PAR_DEBUG
       Users should set "PAR_GLOBAL_DEBUG" instead.

       If this variable is set to a true value and par.pl is run, verbose
       output is sent to STDOUT or the logging filehandle.  This is overridden
       by the "-q" option to par.pl, for steps after argument parsing occurs.

       This currently only influences par.pl. Whether this is the intended
       behaviour remains to be verified.

   PAR_GLOBAL_CLEAN
       Setting "PAR_GLOBAL_CLEAN" alters the behavior of par applications
       which see that environment variable at launch.  "PAR_GLOBAL_CLEAN"
       overrides the "-C" option.  Settings of 0 and 1 are supported.  0
       corresponds to not using "-C" on the pp command line; 1 corresponds to
       using "-C" on the pp command line.  "PAR_GLOBAL_CLEAN" is ignored if
       "PAR_GLOBAL_TEMP" is set, yet it controls the form of "PAR_TEMP" when
       "PAR_GLOBAL_TEMP" is not set.

   PAR_GLOBAL_DEBUG
       The PAR loader becomes more verbose when "PAR_DEBUG" is set.  Setting
       "PAR_GLOBAL_DEBUG" guarantees that "PAR_DEBUG" will be set internally,
       initially.  See "PAR_DEBUG" for more details.

   PAR_GLOBAL_TEMP
       Contributes to the calculation of "PAR_TEMP", and is further explained
       there.

   PAR_GLOBAL_TMPDIR
       Contributes to the calculation of "PAR_TEMP", and is further explained
       there.

   PAR_INITIALIZED
       This environment variable is for internal use by the PAR binary loader
       only.  Documented only to avoid surprises if spawned applications
       expect to see a value initialized by the user.

   PAR_PROGNAME
       "PAR_PROGNAME" is set to the fully-qualified path name of the
       executable program.  On Windows, this is reliably obtained from the
       "GetModuleFileName" API.  On other OSes, if the C runtime is given a
       qualified path name, it is used, or the unqualified file name given is
       qualified by walking the path.  This is reasonably reliable given
       normal program spawning conventions, but cannot be guaranteed to be
       correct in all circumstances.

   PAR_APP_REUSE
       Strictly internal. Skip this section if you're not a PAR developer.

       The variable shouldn't ever be exposed to user code and packaged
       applications should not depend on it being set or not.

       If an application has been packaged with the "--reusable" option, the
       bootstrapping code will set this environment variable to the name of
       the program that is to be run instead of the packaged program.  The
       main.pl loader script fetches the file name, deletes the environment
       variable, and then runs the given program.

   PAR_RUN
       This environment variable was set during constructions of "PAR::Packer"
       objects (usually during pp runs only) by versions of PAR up to 0.957.
       Since PAR 0.958, this variable is unused.

   PAR_SPAWNED
       This variable is used internally by the parl binary loader to signal
       the child process that it's the child.

       You should not rely on this variable outside of the PAR binary loader
       code. For a slightly more detailed discussion, please refer to the
       who_am_i.txt documentation file in the PAR source distribution which
       was contributed by Alan Stewart. Related: "PAR_ARGC", "PAR_ARGV_*"

       Documented only to avoid surprises if spawned applications expect to
       see a value initialized by the user.

   PAR_TEMP
       Users should set "PAR_GLOBAL_TEMP" instead.  "PAR_TEMP" is calculated
       from a variety of other variables.  See the "NOTES" section in the pod
       for PAR.pm for a complete description of how the calculation proceeds.
       "PAR_TEMP", once calculated, is used as the location where PAR stores
       its extracted, temporary file cache.

   PAR_TMPDIR
       Contributes to the calculation of "PAR_TEMP", and is further explained
       there.  Users should set "PAR_GLOBAL_TMPDIR" instead.

   PAR_VERBATIM
       The "PAR_VERBATIM" variable controls the way Perl code is packaged into
       a PAR archive or binary executable. If it is set to a true value during
       the packaging process, modules (and scripts) are not passed through the
       default "PAR::Filter::PodStrip" filter which removes all POD
       documentation from the code. Note that the "PAR::Filter::PatchContent"
       filter is still applied.

       The "-F" option to the pp tool overrides the "PAR_VERBATIM" setting.
       That means if you set "PAR_VERBATIM=1" but specify "-F PodStrip" on the
       "pp" command line, the "PodStrip" filter will be applied.

       "PAR_VERBATIM" is not used by the PAR application.

   PAR_VERBOSE
       Setting this environment variable to a positive integer has the same
       effect as using the "-verbose" switch to pp.

   PP_OPTS
       During a pp run, the contents of the "PP_OPTS" variable are treated as
       if they were part of the command line. In newer versions of PAR, you
       can also write options to a file and execute pp as follows to read the
       options from the file:

	 pp @FILENAME

       That can, of course, be combined with other command line arguments to
       pp or the "PP_OPTS" variable.

   TMP, TEMP, TMPDIR, TEMPDIR
       Please refer to "PAR_TMPDIR".
