NAME
       sasl_client_init - SASL client authentication initialization



SYNOPSIS
       #include &ltsasl/sasl.h&gt

       int sasl_client_init(const  sasl_callback_t *callbacks);


DESCRIPTION
       sasl_client_init() initializes SASL. It must be called before any calls
       to sasl_client_start. This call initializes  all  SASL  client  drivers
       (e.g.  authentication  mechanisms).  These  are	usually  found	in the
       /usr/lib/sasl directory but the directory may  be  overriden  with  the
       SASL_PATH enviornment variable.

       callbacks  specifies the base callbacks for all client connections. See
       the sasl_callbacks man page for more information

RETURN VALUE
       sasl_client_init returns an integer which corresponds  to  one  of  the
       following  codes.  SASL_OK  is the only one that indicates success. All
       others indicate errors and should either be handled or the  authentica-
       tion session should be quit.



ERRORS
       SASL_OK Success

       SASL_BADVERS
	       Mechanism version mismatch

       SASL_BADPARAM
	       Error in config file

       SASL_NOMEM
	       Not enough memory to complete operation


CONFORMING TO
       RFC 2222
