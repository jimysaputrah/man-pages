NAME
       ldap_delete,  ldap_delete_s,  ldap_delete_ext, ldap_delete_ext_s - Per-
       form an LDAP delete operation.

LIBRARY
       OpenLDAP LDAP (libldap, -lldap)

SYNOPSIS
       #include &ltldap.h&gt

       int ldap_delete_s(ld, dn)
       LDAP *ld;
       char *dn;

       int ldap_delete(ld, dn)
       LDAP *ld;
       char *dn;

       int ldap_delete_ext(ld, dn, serverctrls, clientctrls, msgidp)
       LDAP *ld;
       char *dn;
       LDAPControl **serverctrls, **clientctrls;
       int *msgidp;

       int ldap_delete_ext_s(ld, dn, serverctrls, clientctrls)
       LDAP *ld;
       char *dn;
       LDAPControl **serverctrls, **clientctrls;

DESCRIPTION
       The ldap_delete_s() routine is used to perform an LDAP delete operation
       synchronously.  It  takes  dn,  the  DN of the entry to be deleted.  It
       returns an LDAP error code, indicating the success or  failure  of  the
       operation.

       The  ldap_delete()  routine is used to perform an LDAP delete operation
       asynchronously. It takes the same parameters  as  ldap_delete_s(),  but
       returns	the  message id of the request it initiated. The result of the
       delete can be obtained by a subsequent call to ldap_result(3).

       The ldap_delete_ext() routine  allows  server  and client  controls  to
       be specified to extend the delete request. This routine is asynchronous
       like ldap_delete(), but its return value is  an	LDAP  error  code.  It
       stores  the  message  id  of  the  request in the integer pointed to by
       msgidp.

       The  ldap_delete_ext_s()  routine  is  the   synchronous   version   of
       ldap_delete_ext().   It also returns an LDAP error code indicating suc-
       cess or failure of the operation.

ERRORS
       ldap_delete_s() returns an LDAP error code which can be interpreted  by
       calling one of ldap_perror(3) and friends.  ldap_delete() returns -1 if
       something went wrong initiating the request. It returns	the  non-nega-
       tive message id of the request if things went ok.

       ldap_delete_ext() and ldap_delete_ext_s() return some Non-zero value if
       something  went wrong initiating the request, else return 0.
