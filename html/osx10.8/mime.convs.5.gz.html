NAME
       mime.convs - mime type conversion file for cups

DESCRIPTION
       The mime.convs file defines the filters that are available for convert-
       ing files from one format to  another.  The  standard  filters  support
       text, PDF, PostScript, HP-GL/2, and many types of image files.

       Additional  filters can be added to the mime.convs file or (preferably)
       to other files in the CUPS configuration directory.

       Each line in the mime.convs file is a comment, blank, or  filter  line.
       Comment	lines  start  with  the  # character. Filter lines specify the
       source and destination MIME types along with a relative cost associated
       with the filter and the filter to run:

       super/type super/type cost filter
       application/postscript application/vnd.cups-raster 50 pstoraster
