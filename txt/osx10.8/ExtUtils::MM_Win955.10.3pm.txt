NAME
       ExtUtils::MM_Win95 - method to customize MakeMaker for Win9X

SYNOPSIS
	 You should not be using this module directly.

DESCRIPTION
       This is a subclass of ExtUtils::MM_Win32 containing changes necessary
       to get MakeMaker playing nice with command.com and other Win9Xisms.

   Overridden methods
       Most of these make up for limitations in the Win9x/nmake command shell.
       Mostly its lack of &&.

       xs_c
	   The && problem.

       xs_cpp
	   The && problem

       xs_o
	   The && problem.

       max_exec_len
	   Win98 chokes on things like Encode if we set the max length to
	   nmake's max of 2K.  So we go for a more conservative value of 1K.

       os_flavor
	   Win95 and Win98 and WinME are collectively Win9x and Win32
