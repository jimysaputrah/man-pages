NAME
       HTML::FormatRTF - Format HTML as RTF

VERSION
       version 2.10

SYNOPSIS
	 use HTML::FormatRTF;

	 my $out_file = "test.rtf";
	 open(RTF, ">$out_file")
	  or die "Can't write-open $out_file: $!\nAborting";

	 print RTF HTML::FormatRTF->format_file(
	   'test.html',
	     'fontname_headings' => "Verdana",
	 );
	 close(RTF);

DESCRIPTION
       HTML::FormatRTF is a class for objects that you use to convert HTML to
       RTF.  There is currently no proper support for tables or forms.

       This is a subclass of HTML::Formatter, whose documentation you should
       consult for more information on underlying methods such as "new",
       "format", "format_file" etc

       You can specify any of the following parameters in the call to "new",
       "format_file", or "format_string":

       lm  Amount of extra indenting to apply to the left margin, in twips
	   (twentieths of a point). Default is 0.

	   So if you wanted the left margin to be an additional half inch
	   larger, you'd set "lm => 720" (since there's 1440 twips in an
	   inch).  If you wanted it to be about 1.5cm larger, you'd set "lw =>
	   850" (since there's about 567 twips in a centimeter).

       rm  Amount of extra indenting to apply to the left margin, in twips
	   (twentieths of a point).  Default is 0.

       normal_halfpoint_size
	   This is the size of normal text in the document, in half-points.
	   The default value is 22, meaning that normal text is in 11 point.

       header_halfpoint_size
	   This is the size of text used in the document's page-header, in
	   half-points. The default value is 17, meaning that normal text is
	   in 7.5 point.  Currently, the header consists just of
	   "p.pagenumber" in the upper-right-hand corner, and cannot be
	   disabled.

       head1_halfpoint_size ... head6_halfpoint_size
	   These control the font size of each heading level, in half-twips.
	   For example, the default for head3_halfpoint_size is 25, meaning
	   that HTML "<h3>...</h3>" text will be in 12.5 point text (in
	   addition to being underlined and in the heading font).

       codeblock_halfpoint_size
	   This controls the font size (in half-points) of the text used for
	   "<pre>...</pre>" text.  By default, it is 18, meaning 9 point.

       fontname_body
	   This option controls what font is to be used for the body of the
	   text -- that is, everything other than heading text and text in
	   pre/code/tt elements. The default value is currently "Times".
	   Other handy values I can suggest using are "Georgia" or "Bookman
	   Old Style".

       fontname_code
	   This option controls what font is to be used for text in
	   pre/code/tt elements. The default value is currently "Courier New".

       fontname_headings
	   This option controls what font name is to be used for headings.
	   You can use the same font as fontname_body, but I prefer a sans-
	   serif font, so the default value is currently "Arial".  Also
	   consider "Tahoma" and "Verdana".

       document_language
	   This option controls what Microsoft language number will be
	   specified as the language for this document. The current default
	   value is 1033, for US English. Consult an RTF reference for other
	   language numbers.

       hr_width
	   This option controls how many underline characters will be used for
	   rendering a "<hr>" tag. Its default value is currently 50. You can
	   usually leave this alone, but under some circumstances you might
	   want to use a smaller or larger number.

       no_prolog
	   If this option is set to a true value, HTML::FormatRTF will make a
	   point of not emitting the RTF prolog before the document.  By
	   default, this is off, meaning that HTML::FormatRTF will emit the
	   prolog.  This option is of interest only to advanced users.

       no_trailer
	   If this option is set to a true value, HTML::FormatRTF will make a
	   point of not emitting the RTF trailer at the end of the document.
	   By default, this is off, meaning that HTML::FormatRTF will emit the
	   bit of RTF that ends the document.  This option is of interest only
	   to advanced users.
