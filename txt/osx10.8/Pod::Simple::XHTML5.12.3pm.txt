NAME
       Pod::Simple::XHTML -- format Pod as validating XHTML

SYNOPSIS
	 use Pod::Simple::XHTML;

	 my $parser = Pod::Simple::XHTML->new();

	 ...

	 $parser->parse_file('path/to/file.pod');

DESCRIPTION
       This class is a formatter that takes Pod and renders it as XHTML
       validating HTML.

       This is a subclass of Pod::Simple::Methody and inherits all its
       methods. The implementation is entirely different than
       Pod::Simple::HTML, but it largely preserves the same interface.

METHODS
       Pod::Simple::XHTML offers a number of methods that modify the format of
       the HTML output. Call these after creating the parser object, but
       before the call to "parse_file":

	 my $parser = Pod::PseudoPod::HTML->new();
	 $parser->set_optional_param("value");
	 $parser->parse_file($file);

   perldoc_url_prefix
       In turning Foo::Bar into http://whatever/Foo%3a%3aBar, what to put
       before the "Foo%3a%3aBar". The default value is
       "http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?".

   perldoc_url_postfix
       What to put after "Foo%3a%3aBar" in the URL. This option is not set by
       default.

   man_url_prefix
       In turning crontab(5) into http://whatever/man/1/crontab, what to put
       before the "1/crontab". The default value is "http://man.he.net/man".

   man_url_postfix
       What to put after "1/crontab" in the URL. This option is not set by
       default.

   title_prefix, title_postfix
       What to put before and after the title in the head. The values should
       already be &-escaped.

   html_css
	 $parser->html_css('path/to/style.css');

       The URL or relative path of a CSS file to include. This option is not
       set by default.

   html_javascript
       The URL or relative path of a JavaScript file to pull in. This option
       is not set by default.

   html_doctype
       A document type tag for the file. This option is not set by default.

   html_header_tags
       Additional arbitrary HTML tags for the header of the document. The
       default value is just a content type header tag:

	 <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1">

       Add additional meta tags here, or blocks of inline CSS or JavaScript
       (wrapped in the appropriate tags).

   html_h_level
       This is the level of HTML "Hn" element to which a Pod "head1"
       corresponds.  For example, if "html_h_level" is set to 2, a head1 will
       produce an H2, a head2 will produce an H3, and so on.

   default_title
       Set a default title for the page if no title can be determined from the
       content. The value of this string should already be &-escaped.

   force_title
       Force a title for the page (don't try to determine it from the
       content).  The value of this string should already be &-escaped.

   html_header, html_footer
       Set the HTML output at the beginning and end of each file. The default
       header includes a title, a doctype tag (if "html_doctype" is set), a
       content tag (customized by "html_header_tags"), a tag for a CSS file
       (if "html_css" is set), and a tag for a Javascript file (if
       "html_javascript" is set). The default footer simply closes the "html"
       and "body" tags.

       The options listed above customize parts of the default header, but
       setting "html_header" or "html_footer" completely overrides the built-
       in header or footer. These may be useful if you want to use template
       tags instead of literal HTML headers and footers or are integrating
       converted POD pages in a larger website.

       If you want no headers or footers output in the HTML, set these options
       to the empty string.

   index
       Whether to add a table-of-contents at the top of each page (called an
       index for the sake of tradition).

SUBCLASSING
       If the standard options aren't enough, you may want to subclass
       Pod::Simple::XHMTL. These are the most likely candidates for methods
       you'll want to override when subclassing.

   handle_text
       This method handles the body of text within any element: it's the body
       of a paragraph, or everything between a "=begin" tag and the
       corresponding "=end" tag, or the text within an L entity, etc. You
       would want to override this if you are adding a custom element type
       that does more than just display formatted text. Perhaps adding a way
       to generate HTML tables from an extended version of POD.

       So, let's say you want add a custom element called 'foo'. In your
       subclass's "new" method, after calling "SUPER::new" you'd call:

	 $new->accept_targets_as_text( 'foo' );

       Then override the "start_for" method in the subclass to check for when
       "$flags->{'target'}" is equal to 'foo' and set a flag that marks that
       you're in a foo block (maybe "$self->{'in_foo'} = 1"). Then override
       the "handle_text" method to check for the flag, and pass $text to your
       custom subroutine to construct the HTML output for 'foo' elements,
       something like:

	 sub handle_text {
	     my ($self, $text) = @_;
	     if ($self->{'in_foo'}) {
		 $self->{'scratch'} .= build_foo_html($text);
	     } else {
		 $self->{'scratch'} .= $text;
	     }
	 }

   accept_targets_as_html
       This method behaves like "accept_targets_as_text", but also marks the
       region as one whose content should be emitted literally, without HTML
       entity escaping or wrapping in a "div" element.

   resolve_pod_page_link
	 my $url = $pod->resolve_pod_page_link('Net::Ping', 'INSTALL');
	 my $url = $pod->resolve_pod_page_link('perlpodspec');
	 my $url = $pod->resolve_pod_page_link(undef, 'SYNOPSIS');

       Resolves a POD link target (typically a module or POD file name) and
       section name to a URL. The resulting link will be returned for the
       above examples as:

	 http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Net::Ping#INSTALL
	 http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?perlpodspec
	 #SYNOPSIS

       Note that when there is only a section argument the URL will simply be
       a link to a section in the current document.

   resolve_man_page_link
	 my $url = $pod->resolve_man_page_link('crontab(5)', 'EXAMPLE CRON FILE');
	 my $url = $pod->resolve_man_page_link('crontab');

       Resolves a man page link target and numeric section to a URL. The
       resulting link will be returned for the above examples as:

	   http://man.he.net/man5/crontab
	   http://man.he.net/man1/crontab

       Note that the first argument is required. The section number will be
       parsed from it, and if it's missing will default to 1. The second
       argument is currently ignored, as man.he.net <http://man.he.net> does
       not currently include linkable IDs or anchor names in its pages.
       Subclass to link to a different man page HTTP server.

   idify
	 my $id   = $pod->idify($text);
	 my $hash = $pod->idify($text, 1);

       This method turns an arbitrary string into a valid XHTML ID attribute
       value.  The rules enforced, following
       <http://webdesign.about.com/od/htmltags/a/aa031707.htm>, are:

       o   The id must start with a letter (a-z or A-Z)

       o   All subsequent characters can be letters, numbers (0-9), hyphens
	   (-), underscores (_), colons (:), and periods (.).

       o   Each id must be unique within the document.

       In addition, the returned value will be unique within the context of
       the Pod::Simple::XHTML object unless a second argument is passed a true
       value. ID attributes should always be unique within a single XHTML
       document, but pass the true value if you are creating not an ID but a
       URL hash to point to an ID (i.e., if you need to put the "#foo" in "<a
       href="#foo">foo</a>".

   batch_mode_page_object_init
	 $pod->batch_mode_page_object_init($batchconvobj, $module, $infile, $outfile, $depth);

       Called by Pod::Simple::HTMLBatch so that the class has a chance to
       initialize the converter. Internally it sets the "batch_mode" property
       to true and sets "batch_mode_current_level()", but Pod::Simple::XHTML
       does not currently use those features. Subclasses might, though.
