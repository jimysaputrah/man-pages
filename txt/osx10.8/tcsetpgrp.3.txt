NAME
     tcsetpgrp -- set foreground process group ID

LIBRARY
     Standard C Library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <unistd.h>

     int
     tcsetpgrp(int fildes, pid_t pgid_id);

DESCRIPTION
     If the process has a controlling terminal, the tcsetpgrp() function sets
     the foreground process group ID associated with the terminal device to
     pgid_id.  The terminal device associated with fildes must be the control-
     ling terminal of the calling process and the controlling terminal must be
     currently associated with the session of the calling process.  The value
     of pgid_id must be the same as the process group ID of a process in the
     same session as the calling process.

RETURN VALUES
     The tcsetpgrp() function returns the value 0 if successful; otherwise the
     value -1 is returned and the global variable errno is set to indicate the
     error.

ERRORS
     The tcsetpgrp() function will fail if:

     [EBADF]		The fildes argument is not a valid file descriptor.

     [EINVAL]		An invalid value of pgid_id was specified.

     [ENOTTY]		The calling process does not have a controlling termi-
			nal, or the file represented by fildes is not the con-
			trolling terminal, or the controlling terminal is no
			longer associated with the session of the calling
			process.

     [EPERM]		The pgid_id argument does not match the process group
			ID of a process in the same session as the calling
			process.

LEGACY SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/types.h>
     #include <unistd.h>

     The include file <sys/types.h> is necessary.

STANDARDS
     The tcsetpgrp() function is expected to be compliant with the IEEE Std
     1003.1-1988 (``POSIX.1'') specification.
