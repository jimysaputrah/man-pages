NAME
       glutDestroyWindow - destroys the specified window.

SYNTAX
       #include <GLUT/glut.h>

       void glutDestroyWindow(int win);

ARGUMENTS
       win	 Identifier of GLUT window to destroy.

DESCRIPTION
       glutDestroyWindow destroys the window specified by win and the window's
       associated OpenGL context, logical colormap (if	the  window  is  color
       index),	and  overlay  and related state (if an overlay has been estab-
       lished). Any subwindows of destroyed  windows  are  also  destroyed  by
       glutDestroyWindow.  If  win  was the current window, the current window
       becomes invalid ( glutGetWindow will return zero).
