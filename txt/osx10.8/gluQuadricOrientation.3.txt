NAME
       gluQuadricOrientation - specify inside/outside orientation for quadrics


C SPECIFICATION
       void gluQuadricOrientation( GLUquadric* quad,
				   GLenum orientation )


PARAMETERS
       quad	    Specifies	 the	quadrics    object    (created	  with
		    gluNewQuadric).

       orientation  Specifies	the  desired  orientation.  Valid  values  are
		    GLU_OUTSIDE and GLU_INSIDE.

DESCRIPTION
       gluQuadricOrientation specifies what kind of orientation is desired for
       quadrics rendered with quad. The orientation values are as follows:

       GLU_OUTSIDE    Quadrics	are  drawn  with normals pointing outward (the
		      initial value).

       GLU_INSIDE     Quadrics are drawn with normals pointing inward.

       Note that the interpretation of	outward  and  inward  depends  on  the
       quadric being drawn.
