NAME
       DateTime::TimeZone::OlsonDB - An object to represent an Olson time zone
       database

VERSION
       version 1.41

SYNOPSIS
	 none yet

DESCRIPTION
       This module parses the Olson database time zone definition files and
       creates various objects representing time zone data.

       Each time zone is broken down into several parts.  The first piece is
       an observance, which is an offset from UTC and an abbreviation.	A
       single zone may contain many observances, reflecting historical changes
       in that time zone over time.  An observance may also refer to a set of
       rules.

       Rules are named, and may apply to many different zones.	For example,
       the "US" rules apply to most of the time zones in the US,
       unsurprisingly.	Rules are made of an offset from standard time and a
       definition of when that offset changes.	Changes can be a one time
       thing, or they can recur at regular times through a span of years.

       Each rule may have an associated letter, which is used to generate an
       abbreviated name for the time zone, along with the offset's
       abbreviation.  For example, if the offset's abbreviation is "C%sT", and
       the a rule specifies the letter "S", then the abbreviation when that
       rule is in effect is "CST".

USAGE
       Not yet documented.  This stuff is a mess.
