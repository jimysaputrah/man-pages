NAME
       DROP_DOMAIN - remove a domain

SYNOPSIS
       DROP DOMAIN [ IF EXISTS ] name [, ...] [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ]

DESCRIPTION
       DROP DOMAIN removes a domain. Only the owner of a domain can remove it.

PARAMETERS
       IF EXISTS
	   Do not throw an error if the domain does not exist. A notice is
	   issued in this case.

       name
	   The name (optionally schema-qualified) of an existing domain.

       CASCADE
	   Automatically drop objects that depend on the domain (such as table
	   columns).

       RESTRICT
	   Refuse to drop the domain if any objects depend on it. This is the
	   default.

EXAMPLES
       To remove the domain box:

	   DROP DOMAIN box;

COMPATIBILITY
       This command conforms to the SQL standard, except for the IF EXISTS
       option, which is a PostgreSQL extension.
