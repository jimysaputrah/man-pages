DESCRIPTION
       Mail::SPF::Base is a common base class for all Mail::SPF classes.

   Constructor
       The following constructor is provided:

       new(%options): returns Mail::SPF::Base
	   Creates a new object of the class on which the constructor was
	   invoked.  The provided options are stored as key/value pairs in the
	   new object.

	   The "new" constructor may also be called on an object, in which
	   case the object is cloned.  Any options provided override those
	   from the old object.

	   There are no common options defined in Mail::SPF::Base.

   Class methods
       The following class methods are provided:

       class: returns string
	   Returns the class name of the class or object on which it is
	   invoked.

   Class methods
       The following class methods are provided:

       make_accessor($name, $readonly): returns code-ref
	   Creates an accessor method in the class on which it is invoked.
	   The accessor has the given name and accesses the object field of
	   the same name.  If $readonly is true, the accessor is made read-
	   only.
