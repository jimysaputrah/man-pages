NAME
       Term::Complete - Perl word completion module

       <tab>
	   Attempts word completion.  Cannot be changed.

       ^D  Prints completion list.  Defined by $Term::Complete::complete.

       ^U  Erases the current input.  Defined by $Term::Complete::kill.

       <del>, <bs>
	   Erases one character.  Defined by $Term::Complete::erase1 and
	   $Term::Complete::erase2.

DIAGNOSTICS
       Bell sounds when word completion fails.

BUGS
       The completion character <tab> cannot be changed.
