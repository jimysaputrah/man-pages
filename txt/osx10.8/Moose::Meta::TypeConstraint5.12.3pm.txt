NAME
       Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint - The Moose Type Constraint metaclass

VERSION
       version 2.0205

DESCRIPTION
       This class represents a single type constraint. Moose's built-in type
       constraints, as well as constraints you define, are all stored in a
       Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint::Registry object as objects of this class.

INHERITANCE
       "Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint" is a subclass of Class::MOP::Object.

METHODS
       Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint->new(%options)
	   This creates a new type constraint based on the provided %options:

	   o	   name

		   The constraint name. If a name is not provided, it will be
		   set to "__ANON__".

	   o	   parent

		   A "Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint" object which is the parent
		   type for the type being created. This is optional.

	   o	   constraint

		   This is the subroutine reference that implements the actual
		   constraint check. This defaults to a subroutine which
		   always returns true.

	   o	   message

		   A subroutine reference which is used to generate an error
		   message when the constraint fails. This is optional.

	   o	   coercion

		   A Moose::Meta::TypeCoercion object representing the
		   coercions to the type. This is optional.

	   o	   inlined

		   A subroutine which returns a string suitable for inlining
		   this type constraint. It will be called as a method on the
		   type constraint object, and will receive a single
		   additional parameter, a variable name to be tested (usually
		   "$_" or "$_[0]".

		   This is optional.

	   o	   inline_environment

		   A hash reference of variables to close over. The keys are
		   variables names, and the values are references to the
		   variables.

	   o	   optimized

		   This option is deprecated.

		   This is a variant of the "constraint" parameter that is
		   somehow optimized. Typically, this means incorporating both
		   the type's constraint and all of its parents' constraints
		   into a single subroutine reference.

       $constraint->equals($type_name_or_object)
	   Returns true if the supplied name or type object is the same as the
	   current type.

       $constraint->is_subtype_of($type_name_or_object)
	   Returns true if the supplied name or type object is a parent of the
	   current type.

       $constraint->is_a_type_of($type_name_or_object)
	   Returns true if the given type is the same as the current type, or
	   is a parent of the current type. This is a shortcut for checking
	   "equals" and "is_subtype_of".

       $constraint->coerce($value)
	   This will attempt to coerce the value to the type. If the type does
	   not have any defined coercions this will throw an error.

	   If no coercion can produce a value matching $constraint, the
	   original value is returned.

       $constraint->assert_coerce($value)
	   This method behaves just like "coerce", but if the result is not
	   valid according to $constraint, an error is thrown.

       $constraint->check($value)
	   Returns true if the given value passes the constraint for the type.

       $constraint->validate($value)
	   This is similar to "check". However, if the type is valid then the
	   method returns an explicit "undef". If the type is not valid, we
	   call "$self->get_message($value)" internally to generate an error
	   message.

       $constraint->assert_valid($value)
	   Like "check" and "validate", this method checks whether $value is
	   valid under the constraint.	If it is, it will return true.	If it
	   is not, an exception will be thrown with the results of
	   "$self->get_message($value)".

       $constraint->name
	   Returns the type's name, as provided to the constructor.

       $constraint->parent
	   Returns the type's parent, as provided to the constructor, if any.

       $constraint->has_parent
	   Returns true if the type has a parent type.

       $constraint->parents
	   A synonym for "parent". This is useful for polymorphism with types
	   that can have more than one parent.

       $constraint->constraint
	   Returns the type's constraint, as provided to the constructor.

       $constraint->get_message($value)
	   This generates a method for the given value. If the type does not
	   have an explicit message, we generate a default message.

       $constraint->has_message
	   Returns true if the type has a message.

       $constraint->message
	   Returns the type's message as a subroutine reference.

       $constraint->coercion
	   Returns the type's Moose::Meta::TypeCoercion object, if one exists.

       $constraint->has_coercion
	   Returns true if the type has a coercion.

       $constraint->can_be_inlined
	   Returns true if this type constraint can be inlined. A type
	   constraint which subtypes an inlinable constraint and does not add
	   an additional constraint "inherits" its parent type's inlining.

       $constraint->hand_optimized_type_constraint
	   This method is deprecated.

	   Returns the type's hand optimized constraint, as provided to the
	   constructor via the "optimized" option.

       $constraint->has_hand_optimized_type_constraint
	   This method is deprecated.

	   Returns true if the type has an optimized constraint.

       $constraint->create_child_type(%options)
	   This returns a new type constraint of the same class using the
	   provided %options. The "parent" option will be the current type.

	   This method exists so that subclasses of this class can override
	   this behavior and change how child types are created.
