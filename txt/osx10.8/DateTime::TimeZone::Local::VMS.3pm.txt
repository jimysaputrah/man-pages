NAME
       DateTime::TimeZone::Local::VMS - Determine the local system's time zone
       on VMS

VERSION
       version 1.41

SYNOPSIS
	 my $tz = DateTime::TimeZone->new( name => 'local' );

	 my $tz = DateTime::TimeZone::Local->TimeZone();

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides methods for determining the local time zone on a
       VMS platform.

       NOTE: This is basically a stub pending an implementation by someone who
       knows something about VMS.

HOW THE TIME ZONE IS DETERMINED
       This class tries the following methods of determining the local time
       zone:

       o   %ENV

	   We check the following environment variables:

	   o	   TZ

	   o	   SYS$TIMEZONE_RULE

	   o	   SYS$TIMEZONE_NAME

	   o	   UCX$TZ

	   o	   TCPIP$TZ
