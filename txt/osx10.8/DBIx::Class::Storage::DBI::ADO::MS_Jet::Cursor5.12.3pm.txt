NAME
       DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::ADO::MS_Jet::Cursor - GUID Support for MS
       Access over ADO

DESCRIPTION
       This class is for normalizing GUIDs retrieved from Microsoft Access
       over ADO.

       You probably don't want to be here, see
       DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::ACCESS for information on the Microsoft
       Access driver.

       Unfortunately when using DBD::ADO, GUIDs come back wrapped in braces,
       the purpose of this class is to remove them.
       DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::ADO::MS_Jet sets cursor_class to this class
       by default.  It is overridable via your connect_info.

       You can use DBIx::Class::Cursor::Cached safely with this class and not
       lose the GUID normalizing functionality, ::Cursor::Cached uses the
       underlying class data for the inner cursor class.
