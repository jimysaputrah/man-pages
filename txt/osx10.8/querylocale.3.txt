NAME
     querylocale -- Get locale name for a specified category

SYNOPSIS
     #include <xlocale.h>

     const char *
     querylocale(int mask, locale_t loc);

DESCRIPTION
     Returns the name of the locale for the category specified by mask.  The
     mask is scanned starting at the least significant bit, until the first
     set bit is found. This happens to scan the categories alphabetically, not
     including LC_ALL_MASK, but it is best to specify one category at a time.
     The available categories are documented in xlocale(3) and newlocale(3).
