NAME
       glCompileShader - Compiles a shader object

C SPECIFICATION
       void glCompileShader(GLuint shader);

PARAMETERS
       shader
	   Specifies the shader object to be compiled.

DESCRIPTION
       glCompileShader compiles the source code strings that have been stored
       in the shader object specified by shader.

       The compilation status will be stored as part of the shader object's
       state. This value will be set to GL_TRUE if the shader was compiled
       without errors and is ready for use, and GL_FALSE otherwise. It can be
       queried by calling glGetShader() with arguments shader and
       GL_COMPILE_STATUS.

       Compilation of a shader can fail for a number of reasons as specified
       by the OpenGL Shading Language Specification. Whether or not the
       compilation was successful, information about the compilation can be
       obtained from the shader object's information log by calling
       glGetShaderInfoLog().

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if shader is not a value generated by
       OpenGL.

       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if shader is not a shader object.

ASSOCIATED GETS
       glGetShaderInfoLog() with argument shader

       glGetShader() with arguments shader and GL_COMPILE_STATUS

       glIsShader()
