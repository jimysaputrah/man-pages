NAME
       SQL::Translator::Parser::DBIx::Class - Create a SQL::Translator schema
       from a DBIx::Class::Schema instance

SYNOPSIS
	## Via DBIx::Class
	use MyApp::Schema;
	my $schema = MyApp::Schema->connect("dbi:SQLite:something.db");
	$schema->create_ddl_dir();
	## or
	$schema->deploy();

	## Standalone
	use MyApp::Schema;
	use SQL::Translator;

	my $schema = MyApp::Schema->connect;
	my $trans  = SQL::Translator->new (
	     parser	 => 'SQL::Translator::Parser::DBIx::Class',
	     parser_args => {
		 package => $schema,
		 add_fk_index => 0,
		 sources => [qw/
		   Artist
		   CD
		 /],
	     },
	     producer	 => 'SQLite',
	    ) or die SQL::Translator->error;
	my $out = $trans->translate() or die $trans->error;

DESCRIPTION
       This class requires SQL::Translator installed to work.

       "SQL::Translator::Parser::DBIx::Class" reads a DBIx::Class schema,
       interrogates the columns, and stuffs it all in an $sqlt_schema object.

       Its primary use is in deploying database layouts described as a set of
       DBIx::Class classes, to a database. To do this, see "deploy" in
       DBIx::Class::Schema.

       This can also be achieved by having DBIx::Class export the schema as a
       set of SQL files ready for import into your database, or passed to
       other machines that need to have your application installed but don't
       have SQL::Translator installed. To do this see "create_ddl_dir" in
       DBIx::Class::Schema.

PARSER OPTIONS
   add_fk_index
       Create an index for each foreign key.  Enabled by default, as having
       indexed foreign key columns is normally the sensible thing to do.

   sources
       Arguments: \@class_names

       Limit the amount of parsed sources by supplying an explicit list of
       source names.
