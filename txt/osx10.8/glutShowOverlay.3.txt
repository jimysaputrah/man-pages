NAME
       glutShowOverlay,  glutHideOverlay  -  shows or hides the overlay of the
       current window

SYNTAX
       #include <GLUT/glut.h>

       void glutShowOverlay(void);
       void glutHideOverlay(void);

DESCRIPTION
       glutShowOverlay shows the overlay of the current window;  glutHideOver-
       lay hides the overlay. The effect of showing or hiding an overlay takes
       place immediately. Note that glutShowOverlay will not actually  display
       the  overlay  unless  the window is also shown (and even a shown window
       may be obscured by other windows, thereby obscuring the overlay). It is
       typically  faster  and less resource intensive to use these routines to
       control the display status of an overlay as opposed to removing and re-
       establishing the overlay.
