DESCRIPTION
       This procedure delays the calling process by the number of milliseconds
       given by the ms parameter and returns after that time has elapsed.   It
       is typically used for things like flashing a button, where the delay is
       short and the application need not do anything  while  it  waits.   For
       longer  delays  where  the application needs to respond to other events
       during the delay, the procedure Tcl_CreateTimerHandler should  be  used
       instead of Tcl_Sleep.

KEYWORDS
       sleep, time, wait
