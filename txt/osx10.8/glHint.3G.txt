NAME
       glHint - specify implementation-specific hints

C SPECIFICATION
       void glHint(GLenum target, GLenum mode);

PARAMETERS
       target
	   Specifies a symbolic constant indicating the behavior to be
	   controlled.	GL_LINE_SMOOTH_HINT, GL_POLYGON_SMOOTH_HINT,
	   GL_TEXTURE_COMPRESSION_HINT, and GL_FRAGMENT_SHADER_DERIVATIVE_HINT
	   are accepted.

       mode
	   Specifies a symbolic constant indicating the desired behavior.
	   GL_FASTEST, GL_NICEST, and GL_DONT_CARE are accepted.

DESCRIPTION
       Certain aspects of GL behavior, when there is room for interpretation,
       can be controlled with hints. A hint is specified with two arguments.
       target is a symbolic constant indicating the behavior to be controlled,
       and mode is another symbolic constant indicating the desired behavior.
       The initial value for each target is GL_DONT_CARE.  mode can be one of
       the following:

       GL_FASTEST

	   The most efficient option should be chosen.

       GL_NICEST

	   The most correct, or highest quality, option should be chosen.

       GL_DONT_CARE

	   No preference.

       Though the implementation aspects that can be hinted are well defined,
       the interpretation of the hints depends on the implementation. The hint
       aspects that can be specified with target, along with suggested
       semantics, are as follows:

       GL_FRAGMENT_SHADER_DERIVATIVE_HINT

	   Indicates the accuracy of the derivative calculation for the GL
	   shading language fragment processing built-in functions: dFdx,
	   dFdy, and fwidth.

       GL_LINE_SMOOTH_HINT

	   Indicates the sampling quality of antialiased lines. If a larger
	   filter function is applied, hinting GL_NICEST can result in more
	   pixel fragments being generated during rasterization.

       GL_POLYGON_SMOOTH_HINT

	   Indicates the sampling quality of antialiased polygons. Hinting
	   GL_NICEST can result in more pixel fragments being generated during
	   rasterization, if a larger filter function is applied.

       GL_TEXTURE_COMPRESSION_HINT

	   Indicates the quality and performance of the compressing texture
	   images. Hinting GL_FASTEST indicates that texture images should be
	   compressed as quickly as possible, while GL_NICEST indicates that
	   texture images should be compressed with as little image quality
	   loss as possible.  GL_NICEST should be selected if the texture is
	   to be retrieved by glGetCompressedTexImage() for reuse.

NOTES
       The interpretation of hints depends on the implementation. Some
       implementations ignore glHint settings.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if either target or mode is not an
       accepted value.
