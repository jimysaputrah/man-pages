NAME
       glGenQueries - generate query object names

C SPECIFICATION
       void glGenQueries(GLsizei n, GLuint * ids);

PARAMETERS
       n
	   Specifies the number of query object names to be generated.

       ids
	   Specifies an array in which the generated query object names are
	   stored.

DESCRIPTION
       glGenQueries returns n query object names in ids. There is no guarantee
       that the names form a contiguous set of integers; however, it is
       guaranteed that none of the returned names was in use immediately
       before the call to glGenQueries.

       Query object names returned by a call to glGenQueries are not returned
       by subsequent calls, unless they are first deleted with
       glDeleteQueries().

       No query objects are associated with the returned query object names
       until they are first used by calling glBeginQuery().

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if n is negative.


       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if glGenQueries is executed between
       the execution of glBeginQuery() and the corresponding execution of
       glEndQuery().

ASSOCIATED GETS
       glIsQuery()

SEE ALSO
       glBeginQuery(), glDeleteQueries(), glEndQuery()
