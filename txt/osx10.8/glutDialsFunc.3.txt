NAME
       glutDialsFunc  - sets the dial & button box dials callback for the cur-
       rent window.

SYNTAX
       #include <GLUT/glut.h>

       void glutDialsFunc(void (*func)(int dial, int value));

ARGUMENTS
       func	 The new dials callback function.

DESCRIPTION
       glutDialsFunc sets the dial & button box dials callback for the current
       window.	The  dial  &  button box dials callback for a window is called
       when the window has dial & button box input focus (normally,  when  the
       mouse  is  in the window) and the user generates dial & button box dial
       changes. The dial parameter will be the dial number (starting at  one).
       The  number of available dial & button box dials can be determined with
       glutDeviceGet(GLUT_NUM_DIALS). The value measures the absolute rotation
       in  degrees.  Dial values do not ``roll over'' with each complete rota-
       tion but continue to accumulate degrees (until the int dial value over-
       flows).

       Registering a dial & button box dials callback when a dial & button box
       device is not available is ineffectual and not an error. In this  case,
       no dial & button box dials callbacks will be generated.

       Passing	NULL to glutDialsFunc disables the generation of dial & button
       box dials callbacks. When a new window is created, no dial & button box
       dials callback is initially registered.
