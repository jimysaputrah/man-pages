NAME
       CPANPLUS::Dist::Build - CPANPLUS plugin to install packages that use
       Build.PL

SYNOPSIS
	   my $build = CPANPLUS::Dist->new(
				       format  => 'CPANPLUS::Dist::Build',
				       module  => $modobj,
				   );

	   $build->prepare;    # runs Build.PL
	   $build->create;     # runs build && build test
	   $build->install;    # runs build install

DESCRIPTION
       "CPANPLUS::Dist::Build" is a distribution class for "Module::Build"
       related modules.  Using this package, you can create, install and
       uninstall perl modules. It inherits from "CPANPLUS::Dist".

       Normal users won't have to worry about the interface to this module, as
       it functions transparently as a plug-in to "CPANPLUS" and will just "Do
       The Right Thing" when it's loaded.

ACCESSORS
       "parent()"
	   Returns the "CPANPLUS::Module" object that parented this object.

       "status()"
	   Returns the "Object::Accessor" object that keeps the status for
	   this module.

STATUS ACCESSORS
       All accessors can be accessed as follows:
	   $build->status->ACCESSOR

       "build_pl ()"
	   Location of the Build file.	Set to 0 explicitly if something went
	   wrong.

       "build ()"
	   BOOL indicating if the "Build" command was successful.

       "test ()"
	   BOOL indicating if the "Build test" command was successful.

       "prepared ()"
	   BOOL indicating if the "prepare" call exited succesfully This gets
	   set after "perl Build.PL"

       "distdir ()"
	   Full path to the directory in which the "prepare" call took place,
	   set after a call to "prepare".

       "created ()"
	   BOOL indicating if the "create" call exited succesfully. This gets
	   set after "Build" and "Build test".

       "installed ()"
	   BOOL indicating if the module was installed. This gets set after
	   "Build install" exits successfully.

       uninstalled ()
	   BOOL indicating if the module was uninstalled properly.

       "_create_args ()"
	   Storage of the arguments passed to "create" for this object. Used
	   for recursive calls when satisfying prerequisites.

       "_install_args ()"
	   Storage of the arguments passed to "install" for this object. Used
	   for recursive calls when satisfying prerequisites.

METHODS
   $bool = CPANPLUS::Dist::Build->format_available();
       Returns a boolean indicating whether or not you can use this package to
       create and install modules in your environment.

   $bool = $dist->init();
       Sets up the "CPANPLUS::Dist::Build" object for use.  Effectively
       creates all the needed status accessors.

       Called automatically whenever you create a new "CPANPLUS::Dist" object.

   $bool = $dist->prepare([perl => '/path/to/perl', buildflags =>
       'EXTRA=FLAGS', force => BOOL, verbose => BOOL])
       "prepare" prepares a distribution, running "Build.PL" and establishing
       any prerequisites this distribution has.

       The variable "PERL5_CPANPLUS_IS_EXECUTING" will be set to the full path
       of the "Build.PL" that is being executed. This enables any code inside
       the "Build.PL" to know that it is being installed via CPANPLUS.

       After a succcesfull "prepare" you may call "create" to create the
       distribution, followed by "install" to actually install it.

       Returns true on success and false on failure.

   $dist->create([perl => '/path/to/perl', buildflags => 'EXTRA=FLAGS',
       prereq_target => TARGET, force => BOOL, verbose => BOOL, skiptest =>
       BOOL])
       "create" preps a distribution for installation. This means it will run
       "Build" and "Build test".  This will also satisfy any prerequisites the
       module may have.

       If you set "skiptest" to true, it will skip the "Build test" stage.  If
       you set "force" to true, it will go over all the stages of the "Build"
       process again, ignoring any previously cached results. It will also
       ignore a bad return value from "Build test" and still allow the
       operation to return true.

       Returns true on success and false on failure.

       You may then call "$dist->install" on the object to actually install
       it.

   $dist->install([verbose => BOOL, perl => /path/to/perl])
       Actually installs the created dist.

       Returns true on success and false on failure.
