NAME
     getfsstat -- get list of all mounted file systems

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/param.h>
     #include <sys/ucred.h>
     #include <sys/mount.h>

     int
     getfsstat(struct statfs *buf, int bufsize, int flags);

TRANSITIIONAL SYNOPSIS (NOW DEPRECATED)
     int
     getfsstat64(struct statfs64 *buf, int bufsize, int flags);

DESCRIPTION
     The getfsstat() function returns information about all mounted file sys-
     tems.  The buf argument is a pointer to an array of statfs structures
     (see statfs(2)).  As statfs(2) indicates, the structure is defined dif-
     ferently depending on whether the macro _DARWIN_FEATURE_64_BIT_INODE is
     defined (see stat(2) for more information on this macro).

     Fields that are undefined for a particular file system are set to -1.
     The buffer is filled with an array of statfs structures, one for each
     mounted file system up to the size specified by bufsize.

     If buf is given as NULL, getfsstat() returns just the number of mounted
     file systems.

     If flags is set to MNT_NOWAIT, getfsstat() will directly return the
     information retained in the kernel to avoid delays caused by waiting for
     updated information from a file system that is perhaps temporarily unable
     to respond.  Some of the information returned may be out of date, how-
     ever; if flags is set to MNT_WAIT or MNT_DWAIT instead, getfsstat() will
     request updated information from each mounted filesystem before return-
     ing.

RETURN VALUES
     Upon successful completion, the number of statfs structures is returned.
     Otherwise, -1 is returned and the global variable errno is set to indi-
     cate the error.

ERRORS
     Getfsstat() fails if one or more of the following are true:

     [EFAULT]		The buf argument points to an invalid address.

     [EIO]		An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to
			the file system.

TRANSITIONAL DESCRIPTION (NOW DEPRECATED)
     The getfsstat64() routine is equivalent to the default getfstat() (when
     _DARWIN_FEATURE_64_BIT_INODE is defined), so there is no longer any rea-
     son to use it (it will be removed in the future).

HISTORY
     The getfsstat() function first appeared in 4.4BSD.
