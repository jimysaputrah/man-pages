PAM_GET_USER(3) 	 BSD Library Functions Manual	       PAM_GET_USER(3)

NAME
     pam_get_user -- retrieve user name

LIBRARY
     Pluggable Authentication Module Library (libpam, -lpam)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/types.h>
     #include <security/pam_appl.h>

     int
     pam_get_user(pam_handle_t *pamh, const char **user, const char *prompt);

DESCRIPTION
     The pam_get_user function returns the name of the target user, as speci-
     fied to pam_start(3).  If no user was specified, nor set using
     pam_set_item(3), pam_get_user will prompt for a user name.  Either way, a
     pointer to the user name is stored in the location pointed to by the user
     argument.

     The prompt argument specifies a prompt to use if no user name is cached.
     If it is NULL, the PAM_USER_PROMPT will be used.  If that item is also
     NULL, a hardcoded default prompt will be used.

RETURN VALUES
     The pam_get_user function returns one of the following values:

     [PAM_BUF_ERR]	 Memory buffer error.

     [PAM_CONV_ERR]	 Conversation failure.

     [PAM_SYSTEM_ERR]	 System error.
