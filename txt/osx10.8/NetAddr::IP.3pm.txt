	 NOTE: NetAddr::IP::Util has a full complement of network address
	       utilities to convert back and forth between binary and text.

	 my $ip = new NetAddr::IP::Lite '127.0.0.1';
		or if your prefer
	 my $ip = NetAddr::IP::Lite->new('127.0.0.1);
	       or from a packed IPv4 address
	 my $ip = new_from_aton NetAddr::IP::Lite (inet_aton('127.0.0.1'));
	       or from an octal filtered IPv4 address
	 my $ip = new_no NetAddr::IP::Lite '127.012.0.0';

	 print "The address is ", $ip->addr, " with mask ", $ip->mask, "\n" ;

	 if ($ip->within(new NetAddr::IP "127.0.0.0", "255.0.0.0")) {
	     print "Is a loopback address\n";
	 }

				       # This prints 127.0.0.1/32
	 print "You can also say $ip...\n";

       * The following four functions return ipV6 representations of:

	 ::					  = Zeros();
	 FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF  = Ones();
	 FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF::	  = V4mask();
	 ::FFFF:FFFF				  = V4net();

       ###### DEPRECATED, will be remove in version 5 ############

	 * To accept addresses in the format as returned by
	 inet_aton, invoke the module as:

	 use NetAddr::IP qw(:aton);

       ###### USE new_from_aton instead ##########################

       * To enable usage of legacy data files containing NetAddr::IP objects
       stored using the Storable module.

	 use NetAddr::IP qw(:old_storable);

       * To compact many smaller subnets (see:
       "$me->compact($addr1,$addr2,...)"

	 @compacted_object_list = Compact(@object_list)

       * Return a reference to list of "NetAddr::IP" subnets of $masklen mask
       length, when $number or more addresses from @list_of_subnets are found
       to be contained in said subnet.

	 $arrayref = Coalesce($masklen, $number, @list_of_subnets)

       * By default NetAddr::IP functions and methods return string IPv6
       addresses in uppercase.	To change that to lowercase:

       NOTE: the AUGUST 2010 RFC5952 states:

	   4.3. Lowercase

	     The characters "a", "b", "c", "d", "e", and "f" in an IPv6
	     address MUST be represented in lowercase.

       It is recommended that all NEW applications using NetAddr::IP be
       invoked as shown on the next line.

	 use NetAddr::IP qw(:lower);

       * To ensure the current IPv6 string case behavior even if the default
       changes:

	 use NetAddr::IP qw(:upper);

       * To set a limit on the size of nets processed or returned by
       NetAddr::IP.

       Set the maximum number of nets beyond which NetAddr::IP will return and
       error as a power of 2 (default 16 or 65536 nets). Each 2**16 consumes
       approximately 4 megs of memory. A 2**20 consumes 64 megs of memory, A
       2**24 consumes 1 gigabyte of memory.

	 use NetAddr::IP qw(netlimit);
	 netlimit 20;

       The maximum netlimit allowed is a 2**24. Attempts to set limits below
       the default of 16 or above the maximum of 24 are ignored.

       Returns true on success otherwise undef.

INSTALLATION
       Un-tar the distribution in an appropriate directory and type:

	       perl Makefile.PL
	       make
	       make test
	       make install

       NetAddr::IP depends on NetAddr::IP::Util which installs by default with
       its primary functions compiled using Perl's XS extensions to build a
       'C' library. If you do not have a 'C' complier available or would like
       the slower Pure Perl version for some other reason, then type:

	       perl Makefile.PL -noxs
	       make
	       make test
	       make install

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides an object-oriented abstraction on top of IP
       addresses or IP subnets, that allows for easy manipulations.  Version
       4.xx of NetAdder::IP will will work with older versions of Perl and is
       compatible with Math::BigInt.

       The internal representation of all IP objects is in 128 bit IPv6
       notation.  IPv4 and IPv6 objects may be freely mixed.

   Overloaded Operators
       Many operators have been overloaded, as described below:

       Assignment ("=")
	   Has been optimized to copy one NetAddr::IP object to another very
	   quickly.

       "->copy()"
	   The assignment ("=") operation is only put in to operation when the
	   copied object is further mutated by another overloaded operation.
	   See overload SPECIAL SYMBOLS FOR "use overload" for details.

	   "->copy()" actually creates a new object when called.

       Stringification
	   An object can be used just as a string. For instance, the following
	   code

		   my $ip = new NetAddr::IP '192.168.1.123';
		   print "$ip\n";

	   Will print the string 192.168.1.123/32.

       Equality
	   You can test for equality with either "eq" or "==". "eq" allows the
	   comparison with arbitrary strings as well as NetAddr::IP objects.
	   The following example:

	       if (NetAddr::IP->new('127.0.0.1','255.0.0.0') eq '127.0.0.1/8')
		  { print "Yes\n"; }

	   Will print out "Yes".

	   Comparison with "==" requires both operands to be NetAddr::IP
	   objects.

	   In both cases, a true value is returned if the CIDR representation
	   of the operands is equal.

       Comparison via >, <, >=, <=, <=> and "cmp"
	   Internally, all network objects are represented in 128 bit format.
	   The numeric representation of the network is compared through the
	   corresponding operation. Comparisons are tried first on the address
	   portion of the object and if that is equal then the NUMERIC cidr
	   portion of the masks are compared. This leads to the
	   counterintuitive result that

		   /24 > /16

	   Comparison should not be done on netaddr objects with different
	   CIDR as this may produce indeterminate - unexpected results, rather
	   the determination of which netblock is larger or smaller should be
	   done by comparing

		   $ip1->masklen <=> $ip2->masklen

       Addition of a constant ("+")
	   Add a 32 bit signed constant to the address part of a NetAddr
	   object.  This operation changes the address part to point so many
	   hosts above the current objects start address. For instance, this
	   code:

	       print NetAddr::IP::Lite->new('127.0.0.1/8') + 5;

	   will output 127.0.0.6/8. The address will wrap around at the
	   broadcast back to the network address. This code:

	       print NetAddr::IP::Lite->new('10.0.0.1/24') + 255;

	       outputs 10.0.0.0/24.

	   Returns the the unchanged object when the constant is missing or
	   out of range.

	       2147483647 <= constant >= -2147483648

       Subtraction of a constant ("-")
	   The complement of the addition of a constant.

       Difference ("-")
	   Returns the difference between the address parts of two
	   NetAddr::IP::Lite objects address parts as a 32 bit signed number.

	   Returns undef if the difference is out of range.

	   (See range restrictions on Addition above)

       Auto-increment
	   Auto-incrementing a NetAddr::IP object causes the address part to
	   be adjusted to the next host address within the subnet. It will
	   wrap at the broadcast address and start again from the network
	   address.

       Auto-decrement
	   Auto-decrementing a NetAddr::IP object performs exactly the
	   opposite of auto-incrementing it, as you would expect.

   Serializing and Deserializing
       This module defines hooks to collaborate with Storable for serializing
       "NetAddr::IP" objects, through compact and human readable strings. You
       can revert to the old format by invoking this module as

	 use NetAddr::IP ':old_storable';

       You must do this if you have legacy data files containing NetAddr::IP
       objects stored using the Storable module.

   Methods
       "->new([$addr, [ $mask|IPv6 ]])"
       "->new6([$addr, [ $mask]])"
       "->new_no([$addr, [ $mask]])"
       "->new_from_aton($netaddr)"
       new_cis and new_cis6 are DEPRECATED
       "->new_cis("$addr $mask)"
       "->new_cis6("$addr $mask)"
	   The first two methods create a new address with the supplied
	   address in $addr and an optional netmask $mask, which can be
	   omitted to get a /32 or /128 netmask for IPv4 / IPv6 addresses
	   respectively.

	   The third method "new_no" is exclusively for IPv4 addresses and
	   filters improperly formatted dot quad strings for leading 0's that
	   would normally be interpreted as octal format by NetAddr per the
	   specifications for inet_aton.

	   new_from_aton takes a packed IPv4 address and assumes a /32 mask.
	   This function replaces the DEPRECATED :aton functionality which is
	   fundamentally broken.

	   The last two methods new_cis and new_cis6 differ from new and new6
	   only in that they except the common Cisco address notation for
	   address/mask pairs with a space as a separator instead of a slash
	   (/)

	   These methods are DEPRECATED because the functionality is now
	   included in the other "new" methods

	     i.e.  ->new_cis('1.2.3.0 24')
		   or
		   ->new_cis6('::1.2.3.0 120')

	   "->new6" and "->new_cis6" mark the address as being in ipV6 address
	   space even if the format would suggest otherwise.

	     i.e.  ->new6('1.2.3.4') will result in ::102:304

	     addresses submitted to ->new in ipV6 notation will
	     remain in that notation permanently. i.e.
		   ->new('::1.2.3.4') will result in ::102:304
	     whereas new('1.2.3.4') would print out as 1.2.3.4

	     See "STRINGIFICATION" below.

	   $addr can be almost anything that can be resolved to an IP address
	   in all the notations I have seen over time. It can optionally
	   contain the mask in CIDR notation.

	   prefix notation is understood, with the limitation that the range
	   specified by the prefix must match with a valid subnet.

	   Addresses in the same format returned by "inet_aton" or
	   "gethostbyname" can also be understood, although no mask can be
	   specified for them. The default is to not attempt to recognize this
	   format, as it seems to be seldom used.

	   To accept addresses in that format, invoke the module as in

	     use NetAddr::IP ':aton'

	   If called with no arguments, 'default' is assumed.

	   $addr can be any of the following and possibly more...

	     n.n
	     n.n/mm
	     n.n.n
	     n.n.n/mm
	     n.n.n.n
	     n.n.n.n/mm 	   32 bit cidr notation
	     n.n.n.n/m.m.m.m
	     loopback, localhost, broadcast, any, default
	     x.x.x.x/host
	     0xABCDEF, 0b111111000101011110, (a bcd number)
	     a netaddr as returned by 'inet_aton'

	   Any RFC1884 notation

	     ::n.n.n.n
	     ::n.n.n.n/mmm	   128 bit cidr notation
	     ::n.n.n.n/::m.m.m.m
	     ::x:x
	     ::x:x/mmm
	     x:x:x:x:x:x:x:x
	     x:x:x:x:x:x:x:x/mmm
	     x:x:x:x:x:x:x:x/m:m:m:m:m:m:m:m any RFC1884 notation
	     loopback, localhost, unspecified, any, default
	     ::x:x/host
	     0xABCDEF, 0b111111000101011110 within the limits
	     of perl's number resolution
	     123456789012  a 'big' bcd number (bigger than perl likes)
	     and Math::BigInt

	   If called with no arguments, 'default' is assumed.

       "->broadcast()"
	   Returns a new object referring to the broadcast address of a given
	   subnet. The broadcast address has all ones in all the bit positions
	   where the netmask has zero bits. This is normally used to address
	   all the hosts in a given subnet.

       "->network()"
	   Returns a new object referring to the network address of a given
	   subnet. A network address has all zero bits where the bits of the
	   netmask are zero. Normally this is used to refer to a subnet.

       "->addr()"
	   Returns a scalar with the address part of the object as an IPv4 or
	   IPv6 text string as appropriate. This is useful for printing or for
	   passing the address part of the NetAddr::IP object to other
	   components that expect an IP address. If the object is an ipV6
	   address or was created using ->new6($ip) it will be reported in
	   ipV6 hex format otherwise it will be reported in dot quad format
	   only if it resides in ipV4 address space.

       "->mask()"
	   Returns a scalar with the mask as an IPv4 or IPv6 text string as
	   described above.

       "->masklen()"
	   Returns a scalar the number of one bits in the mask.

       "->bits()"
	   Returns the width of the address in bits. Normally 32 for v4 and
	   128 for v6.

       "->version()"
	   Returns the version of the address or subnet. Currently this can be
	   either 4 or 6.

       "->cidr()"
	   Returns a scalar with the address and mask in CIDR notation. A
	   NetAddr::IP object stringifies to the result of this function.
	   (see comments about ->new6() and ->addr() for output formats)

       "->aton()"
	   Returns the address part of the NetAddr::IP object in the same
	   format as the "inet_aton()" or "ipv6_aton" function respectively.
	   If the object was created using ->new6($ip), the address returned
	   will always be in ipV6 format, even for addresses in ipV4 address
	   space.

       "->range()"
	   Returns a scalar with the base address and the broadcast address
	   separated by a dash and spaces. This is called range notation.

       "->prefix()"
	   Returns a scalar with the address and mask in ipV4 prefix
	   representation. This is useful for some programs, which expect its
	   input to be in this format. This method will include the broadcast
	   address in the encoding.

       "->nprefix()"
	   Just as "->prefix()", but does not include the broadcast address.

       "->numeric()"
	   When called in a scalar context, will return a numeric
	   representation of the address part of the IP address. When called
	   in an array contest, it returns a list of two elements. The first
	   element is as described, the second element is the numeric
	   representation of the netmask.

	   This method is essential for serializing the representation of a
	   subnet.

       "->bigint()"
	   When called in scalar context, will return a Math::BigInt
	   representation of the address part of the IP address. When called
	   in an array context, it returns a list of tow elements, The first
	   element is as described, the second element is the Math::BigInt
	   representation of the netmask.

       "->wildcard()"
	   When called in a scalar context, returns the wildcard bits
	   corresponding to the mask, in dotted-quad or ipV6 format as
	   applicable.

	   When called in an array context, returns a two-element array. The
	   first element, is the address part. The second element, is the
	   wildcard translation of the mask.

       "->short()"
	   Returns the address part in a short or compact notation.

	     (ie, 127.0.0.1 becomes 127.1).

	   Works with both, V4 and V6.

       "->full()"
	   Returns the address part in FULL notation for ipV4 and ipV6
	   respectively.

	     i.e. for ipV4
	       0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:127.0.0.1

		  for ipV6
	       0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000

	   To force ipV4 addresses into full ipV6 format use:

       "->full6()"
	   Returns the address part in FULL ipV6 notation

       "$me->contains($other)"
	   Returns true when $me completely contains $other. False is returned
	   otherwise and "undef" is returned if $me and $other are not both
	   "NetAddr::IP" objects.

       "$me->within($other)"
	   The complement of "->contains()". Returns true when $me is
	   completely contained within $other.

	   Note that $me and $other must be "NetAddr::IP" objects.

       "->splitref($bits,[optional $bits1,$bits2,...])"
	   Returns a reference to a list of objects, representing subnets of
	   "bits" mask produced by splitting the original object, which is
	   left unchanged. Note that $bits must be longer than the original
	   mask in order for it to be splittable.

	   ERROR conditions:

	     ->splitref will DIE with the message 'netlimit exceeded'
	       if the number of return objects exceeds 'netlimit'.
	       See function 'netlimit' above (default 2**16 or 65536 nets).

	     ->splitref returns undef when C<bits> or the (bits list)
	       will not fit within the original object.

	     ->splitref returns undef if a supplied ipV4, ipV6, or NetAddr
	       mask in inappropriately formatted,

	   bits may be a CIDR mask, a dot quad or ipV6 string or a NetAddr::IP
	   object.  If "bits" is missing, the object is split for into all
	   available addresses within the ipV4 or ipV6 object ( auto-mask of
	   CIDR 32, 128 respectively ).

	   With optional additional "bits" list, the original object is split
	   into parts sized based on the list. NOTE: a short list will
	   replicate the last item. If the last item is too large to for what
	   remains of the object after splitting off the first parts of the
	   list, a "best fits" list of remaining objects will be returned
	   based on an increasing sort of the CIDR values of the "bits" list.

	     i.e.  my $ip = new NetAddr::IP('192.168.0.0/24');
		   my $objptr = $ip->split(28, 29, 28, 29, 26);

	      has split plan 28 29 28 29 26 26 26 28
	      and returns this list of objects

		   192.168.0.0/28
		   192.168.0.16/29
		   192.168.0.24/28
		   192.168.0.40/29
		   192.168.0.48/26
		   192.168.0.112/26
		   192.168.0.176/26
		   192.168.0.240/28

	   NOTE: that /26 replicates twice beyond the original request and /28
	   fills the remaining return object requirement.

       "->rsplitref($bits,[optional $bits1,$bits2,...])"
	   "->rsplitref" is the same as "->splitref" above except that the
	   split plan is applied to the original object in reverse order.

	     i.e.  my $ip = new NetAddr::IP('192.168.0.0/24');
		   my @objects = $ip->split(28, 29, 28, 29, 26);

	      has split plan 28 26 26 26 29 28 29 28
	      and returns this list of objects

		   192.168.0.0/28
		   192.168.0.16/26
		   192.168.0.80/26
		   192.168.0.144/26
		   192.168.0.208/29
		   192.168.0.216/28
		   192.168.0.232/29
		   192.168.0.240/28

       "->split($bits,[optional $bits1,$bits2,...])"
	   Similar to "->splitref" above but returns the list rather than a
	   list reference. You may not want to use this if a large number of
	   objects is expected.

       "->rsplit($bits,[optional $bits1,$bits2,...])"
	   Similar to "->rsplitref" above but returns the list rather than a
	   list reference. You may not want to use this if a large number of
	   objects is expected.

       "->hostenum()"
	   Returns the list of hosts within a subnet.

	   ERROR conditions:

	     ->hostenum will DIE with the message 'netlimit exceeded'
	       if the number of return objects exceeds 'netlimit'.
	       See function 'netlimit' above (default 2**16 or 65536 nets).

       "->hostenumref()"
	   Faster version of "->hostenum()", returning a reference to a list.

       "$me->compact($addr1, $addr2, ...)"
       "@compacted_object_list = Compact(@object_list)"
	   Given a list of objects (including $me), this method will compact
	   all the addresses and subnets into the largest (ie, least specific)
	   subnets possible that contain exactly all of the given objects.

	   Note that in versions prior to 3.02, if fed with the same IP
	   subnets multiple times, these subnets would be returned. From 3.02
	   on, a more "correct" approach has been adopted and only one address
	   would be returned.

	   Note that $me and all $addr's must be "NetAddr::IP" objects.

       "$me->compactref(\@list)"
       "$compacted_object_list = Compact(\@list)"
	   As usual, a faster version of "->compact()" that returns a
	   reference to a list. Note that this method takes a reference to a
	   list instead.

	   Note that $me must be a "NetAddr::IP" object.

       "$me->coalesce($masklen, $number, @list_of_subnets)"
       "$arrayref = Coalesce($masklen,$number,@list_of_subnets)"
	   Will return a reference to list of "NetAddr::IP" subnets of
	   $masklen mask length, when $number or more addresses from
	   @list_of_subnets are found to be contained in said subnet.

	   Subnets from @list_of_subnets with a mask shorter than $masklen are
	   passed "as is" to the return list.

	   Subnets from @list_of_subnets with a mask longer than $masklen will
	   be counted (actually, the number of IP addresses is counted)
	   towards $number.

	   Called as a method, the array will include $me.

	   WARNING: the list of subnet must be the same type. i.e ipV4 or ipV6

       "->first()"
	   Returns a new object representing the first usable IP address
	   within the subnet (ie, the first host address).

       "->last()"
	   Returns a new object representing the last usable IP address within
	   the subnet (ie, one less than the broadcast address).

       "->nth($index)"
	   Returns a new object representing the n-th usable IP address within
	   the subnet (ie, the n-th host address).  If no address is available
	   (for example, when the network is too small for $index hosts),
	   "undef" is returned.

	   Version 4.00 of NetAddr::IP and version 1.00 of NetAddr::IP::Lite
	   implements "->nth($index)" and "->num()" exactly as the
	   documentation states.  Previous versions behaved slightly
	   differently and not in a consistent manner. See the README file for
	   details.

	   To use the old behavior for "->nth($index)" and "->num()":

	     use NetAddr::IP::Lite qw(:old_nth);

	     old behavior:
	     NetAddr::IP->new('10/32')->nth(0) == undef
	     NetAddr::IP->new('10/32')->nth(1) == undef
	     NetAddr::IP->new('10/31')->nth(0) == undef
	     NetAddr::IP->new('10/31')->nth(1) == 10.0.0.1/31
	     NetAddr::IP->new('10/30')->nth(0) == undef
	     NetAddr::IP->new('10/30')->nth(1) == 10.0.0.1/30
	     NetAddr::IP->new('10/30')->nth(2) == 10.0.0.2/30
	     NetAddr::IP->new('10/30')->nth(3) == 10.0.0.3/30

	   Note that in each case, the broadcast address is represented in the
	   output set and that the 'zero'th index is alway undef except for a
	   point-to-point /31 or /127 network where there are exactly two
	   addresses in the network.

	     new behavior:
	     NetAddr::IP->new('10/32')->nth(0)	== 10.0.0.0/32
	     NetAddr::IP->new('10.1/32'->nth(0) == 10.0.0.1/32
	     NetAddr::IP->new('10/31')->nth(0)	== 10.0.0.0/32
	     NetAddr::IP->new('10/31')->nth(1)	== 10.0.0.1/32
	     NetAddr::IP->new('10/30')->nth(0) == 10.0.0.1/30
	     NetAddr::IP->new('10/30')->nth(1) == 10.0.0.2/30
	     NetAddr::IP->new('10/30')->nth(2) == undef

	   Note that a /32 net always has 1 usable address while a /31 has
	   exactly two usable addresses for point-to-point addressing. The
	   first index (0) returns the address immediately following the
	   network address except for a /31 or /127 when it return the network
	   address.

       "->num()"
	   As of version 4.42 of NetAddr::IP and version 1.27 of
	   NetAddr::IP::Lite a /31 and /127 with return a net num value of 2
	   instead of 0 (zero) for point-to-point networks.

	   Version 4.00 of NetAddr::IP and version 1.00 of NetAddr::IP::Lite
	   return the number of usable IP addresses within the subnet, not
	   counting the broadcast or network address.

	   Previous versions worked only for ipV4 addresses, returned a
	   maximum span of 2**32 and returned the number of IP addresses not
	   counting the broadcast address.
		   (one greater than the new behavior)

	   To use the old behavior for "->nth($index)" and "->num()":

	     use NetAddr::IP::Lite qw(:old_nth);

	   WARNING:

	   NetAddr::IP will calculate and return a numeric string for network
	   ranges as large as 2**128. These values are TEXT strings and perl
	   can treat them as integers for numeric calculations.

	   Perl on 32 bit platforms only handles integer numbers up to 2**32
	   and on 64 bit platforms to 2**64.

	   If you wish to manipulate numeric strings returned by NetAddr::IP
	   that are larger than 2**32 or 2**64, respectively,  you must load
	   additional modules such as Math::BigInt, bignum or some similar
	   package to do the integer math.

       "->re()"
	   Returns a Perl regular expression that will match an IP address
	   within the given subnet. Defaults to ipV4 notation. Will return an
	   ipV6 regex if the address in not in ipV4 space.

       "->re6()"
	   Returns a Perl regular expression that will match an IP address
	   within the given subnet. Always returns an ipV6 regex.

EXPORT_OK
	       Compact
	       Coalesce
	       Zeros
	       Ones
	       V4mask
	       V4net
	       netlimit

NOTES / BUGS ... FEATURES
       NetAddr::IP only runs in Pure Perl mode on Windows boxes because I
       don't have the resources or know how to get the "configure" stuff
       working in the Windows environment. Volunteers WELCOME to port the "C"
       portion of this module to Windows.
