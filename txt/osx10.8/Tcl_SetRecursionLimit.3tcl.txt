NAME
       Tcl_SetRecursionLimit  -  set maximum allowable nesting depth in inter-
       preter

SYNOPSIS
       #include <tcl.h>

       int
       Tcl_SetRecursionLimit(interp, depth)

ARGUMENTS
       Tcl_Interp *interp (in)		Interpreter whose recursion  limit  is
					to be set.  Must be greater than zero.

       int depth (in)			New limit for nested calls to Tcl_Eval
					for interp.
_________________________________________________________________


DESCRIPTION
       At any given time Tcl enforces a limit on the number of recursive calls
       that may  be  active  for  Tcl_Eval  and  related  procedures  such  as
       Tcl_GlobalEval.	 Any  call  to	Tcl_Eval  that	exceeds  this depth is
       aborted with an error.  By default the recursion limit is 1000.

       Tcl_SetRecursionLimit may be used to change the maximum allowable nest-
       ing depth for an interpreter.  The depth argument specifies a new limit
       for interp, and Tcl_SetRecursionLimit returns the old limit.   To  read
       out  the  old  limit without modifying it, invoke Tcl_SetRecursionLimit
       with depth equal to 0.

       The Tcl_SetRecursionLimit only sets the size of the Tcl call stack:  it
       cannot  by  itself prevent stack overflows on the C stack being used by
       the application.  If your machine has a limit on  the  size  of	the  C
       stack,  you  may  get  stack overflows before reaching the limit set by
       Tcl_SetRecursionLimit.  If this happens, see if there is a mechanism in
       your system for increasing the maximum size of the C stack.
