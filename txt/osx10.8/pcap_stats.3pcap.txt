NAME
       pcap_stats - get capture statistics

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pcap/pcap.h>

       int pcap_stats(pcap_t *p, struct pcap_stat *ps);

DESCRIPTION
       pcap_stats()  fills  in	the  struct pcap_stat pointed to by its second
       argument.  The values represent packet statistics from the start of the
       run to the time of the call.

       pcap_stats()  is supported only on live captures, not on ``savefiles'';
       no statistics are stored in ``savefiles'', so no statistics are	avail-
       able when reading from a ``savefile''.

       A struct pcap_stat has the following members:

	      ps_recv
		     number of packets received;

	      ps_drop
		     number  of  packets  dropped because there was no room in
		     the operating system's buffer when they arrived,  because
		     packets weren't being read fast enough;

	      ps_ifdrop
		     number of packets dropped by the network interface or its
		     driver.

       The statistics do not behave the same way on  all  platforms.   ps_recv
       might  count  packets whether they passed any filter set with pcap_set-
       filter(3PCAP) or not, or it might count only packets that pass the fil-
       ter.   It also might, or might not, count packets dropped because there
       was no room  in	the  operating	system's  buffer  when	they  arrived.
       ps_drop	is  not  available  on	all platforms; it is zero on platforms
       where it's not available.  If packet  filtering	is  done  in  libpcap,
       rather  than in the operating system, it would count packets that don't
       pass the filter.  Both ps_recv and ps_drop might, or might  not,  count
       packets not yet read from the operating system and thus not yet seen by
       the application.  ps_ifdrop might, or might  not,  be  implemented;  if
       it's  zero,  that might mean that no packets were dropped by the inter-
       face, or it might mean that the statistic is unavailable, so it	should
       not  be	treated  as  an indication that the interface did not drop any
       packets.

RETURN VALUE
       pcap_stats() returns 0 on success and returns -1 if there is  an  error
       or  if  p  doesn't  support  packet  statistics.   If  -1  is returned,
       pcap_geterr() or pcap_perror() may be called with p as an  argument  to
       fetch or display the error text.
