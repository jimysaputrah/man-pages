NAME
       git-remote-testgit - Example remote-helper

SYNOPSIS
       git clone testgit::<source-repo> [<destination>]


DESCRIPTION
       This command is a simple remote-helper, that is used both as a testcase
       for the remote-helper functionality, and as an example to show
       remote-helper authors one possible implementation.

       The best way to learn more is to read the comments and source code in
       git-remote-testgit.py.
