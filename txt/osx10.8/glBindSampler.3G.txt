NAME
       glBindSampler - bind a named sampler to a texturing target

C SPECIFICATION
       void glBindSampler(GLuint unit, GLuint sampler);

PARAMETERS
       unit
	   Specifies the index of the texture unit to which the sampler is
	   bound.

       sampler
	   Specifies the name of a sampler.

DESCRIPTION
       glBindSampler binds sampler to the texture unit at index unit.  sampler
       must be zero or the name of a sampler object previously returned from a
       call to glGenSamplers().  unit must be less than the value of
       GL_MAX_COMBINED_TEXTURE_IMAGE_UNITS.

       When a sampler object is bound to a texture unit, its state supersedes
       that of the texture object bound to that texture unit. If the sampler
       name zero is bound to a texture unit, the currently bound texture's
       sampler state becomes active. A single sampler object may be bound to
       multiple texture units simultaneously.

NOTES
       glBindSampler is available only if the GL version is 3.3 or higher.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if unit is greater than or equal to the
       value of GL_MAX_COMBIED_TEXTURE_IMAGE_UNITS.


       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if sampler is not zero or a name
       previously returned from a call to glGenSamplers(), or if such a name
       has been deleted by a call to glDeleteSamplers().

ASSOCIATED GETS
       glGet() with argument GL_SAMPLER_BINDING
