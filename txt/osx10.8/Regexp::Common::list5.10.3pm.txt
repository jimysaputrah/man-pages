NAME
       Regexp::Common::list -- provide regexes for lists

SYNOPSIS
	   use Regexp::Common qw /list/;

	   while (<>) {
	       /$RE{list}{-pat => '\w+'}/	   and print "List of words";
	       /$RE{list}{-pat => $RE{num}{real}}/ and print "List of numbers";
	   }

DESCRIPTION
       Please consult the manual of Regexp::Common for a general description
       of the works of this interface.

       Do not use this module directly, but load it via Regexp::Common.

   $RE{list}{-pat}{-sep}{-lastsep}
       Returns a pattern matching a list of (at least two) substrings.

       If "-pat=P" is specified, it defines the pattern for each substring in
       the list. By default, P is "qr/.*?\S/". In Regexp::Common 0.02 or
       earlier, the default pattern was "qr/.*?/". But that will match a
       single space, causing unintended parsing of "a, b, and c" as a list of
       four elements instead of 3 (with "-word" being "(?:and)").  One
       consequence is that a list of the form "a,,b" will no longer be parsed.
       Use the pattern "qr /.*?/" to be able to parse this, but see the
       previous remark.

       If "-sep=P" is specified, it defines the pattern P to be used as a
       separator between each pair of substrings in the list, except the final
       two.  By default P is "qr/\s*,\s*/".

       If "-lastsep=P" is specified, it defines the pattern P to be used as a
       separator between the final two substrings in the list.	By default P
       is the same as the pattern specified by the "-sep" flag.

       For example:

	     $RE{list}{-pat=>'\w+'}		   # match a list of word chars
	     $RE{list}{-pat=>$RE{num}{real}}	   # match a list of numbers
	     $RE{list}{-sep=>"\t"}		   # match a tab-separated list
	     $RE{list}{-lastsep=>',\s+and\s+'}	   # match a proper English list

       Under "-keep":

       $1  captures the entire list

       $2  captures the last separator

   $RE{list}{conj}{-word=PATTERN}
       An alias for $RE{list}{-lastsep=>'\s*,?\s*PATTERN\s*'}

       If "-word" is not specified, the default pattern is "qr/and|or/".

       For example:

	     $RE{list}{conj}{-word=>'et'}	 # match Jean, Paul, et Satre
	     $RE{list}{conj}{-word=>'oder'}	 # match Bonn, Koln oder Hamburg

   $RE{list}{and}
       An alias for $RE{list}{conj}{-word=>'and'}

   $RE{list}{or}
       An alias for $RE{list}{conj}{-word=>'or'}
