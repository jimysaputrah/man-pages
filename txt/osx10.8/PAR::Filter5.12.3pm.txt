NAME
       PAR::Filter - Input filter for PAR

SYNOPSIS
	   $code = 'use strict; print "Hello, World!\n";';
	   $ref = PAR::Filter->new('PodStrip', 'Bleach')->apply(\$code);
	   print $code;    # pod-stripped and obfuscated code
	   print $$ref;    # same thing

	   $ref = PAR::Filter->new('PodStrip', 'Bleach')->apply('file.pl');
	   print $$ref;    # same thing, applied to file.pl

DESCRIPTION
       Starting with PAR 0.76, "pp -f" takes a filter name, like "Bleach", and
       invokes this module to transform the programs with PAR::Filter::Bleach.
       Similarily, "pp -F Bleach" applies the Bleach filter to all included
       modules.

       It is possible to pass in multiple such filters, which are applied in
       turn.

       The output of each such filter is expected be semantically equivalent
       to the input, although possibly obfuscated.

       The default list of filters include:

       o   PAR::Filter::Bleach

	   The archetypical obfuscating filter.

       o   PAR::Filter::Obfuscate

	   Use B::Deobfuscate to strip away indents and comments, as well as
	   mangling variable names.

       o   PAR::Filter::PatchContent

	   Fix PAR-incompatible modules, applied to modules by default.

       o   PAR::Filter::PodStrip

	   Strip away POD sections, applied to modules by default.

       o   PAR::Filter::Bytecode

	   Use B::Bytecode to strip away indents and comments.	This filter is
	   deprecated! For source hiding, have a look at PAR::Filter::Crypto
	   instead and make sure to read about its caveats.
