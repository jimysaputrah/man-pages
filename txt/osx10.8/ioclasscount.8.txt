NAME
     ioclasscount

SYNOPSIS
     ioclasscount [classname] [...]

DESCRIPTION
     ioclasscount displays the instance counts of OSObject-based C++ classes
     in the kernel, incremented by the number of direct subclasses that have
     an instance count of at least 1.  For example, if IONetworkController is
     not directly instantiated, but its direct subclass IOEthernetController
     has any instances, then IONetworkController's instance count will be at
     least 1; if another direct subclass such as IOFWController has any
     instances, then IONetworkController's instance count will be at least 2;
     and so on.  (This modification of instance counts prevents unloading of
     kexts defining superclasses that have no instances, but whose subclasses
     in other kexts have instances.)

     If classes are specified, instance counts are printed as a comma-sepa-
     rated list in the order specified.  If no classes are specified, instance
     counts for all classes are printed, one per line of output and sorted by
     name.

     This information is useful for tracking leaks.  Instance counts can also
     found in the root of the IORegistry in the ``IOKitDiagnostics'' property.

EXAMPLES
     Display instance counts for IOPCIDevice and AppleTestPCI:

     /usr/sbin/ioclasscount IOPCIDevice AppleTestPCI
	    IOPCIDevice = 2, AppleTestPCI = 1
