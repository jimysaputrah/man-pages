NAME
       Pod::Simple - framework for parsing Pod

SYNOPSIS
	TODO

DESCRIPTION
       Pod::Simple is a Perl library for parsing text in the Pod ("plain old
       documentation") markup language that is typically used for writing
       documentation for Perl and for Perl modules. The Pod format is
       explained perlpod; the most common formatter is called "perldoc".

       Pod formatters can use Pod::Simple to parse Pod documents and render
       them into plain text, HTML, or any number of other formats. Typically,
       such formatters will be subclasses of Pod::Simple, and so they will
       inherit its methods, like "parse_file".

       If you're reading this document just because you have a Pod-processing
       subclass that you want to use, this document (plus the documentation
       for the subclass) is probably all you need to read.

       If you're reading this document because you want to write a formatter
       subclass, continue reading it and then read Pod::Simple::Subclassing,
       and then possibly even read perlpodspec (some of which is for parser-
       writers, but much of which is notes to formatter-writers).

MAIN METHODS
       "$parser = SomeClass->new();"
	   This returns a new parser object, where "SomeClass" is a subclass
	   of Pod::Simple.

       "$parser->output_fh( *OUT );"
	   This sets the filehandle that $parser's output will be written to.
	   You can pass *STDOUT, otherwise you should probably do something
	   like this:

	       my $outfile = "output.txt";
	       open TXTOUT, ">$outfile" or die "Can't write to $outfile: $!";
	       $parser->output_fh(*TXTOUT);

	   ...before you call one of the "$parser->parse_whatever" methods.

       "$parser->output_string( \$somestring );"
	   This sets the string that $parser's output will be sent to, instead
	   of any filehandle.

       "$parser->parse_file( $some_filename );"
       "$parser->parse_file( *INPUT_FH );"
	   This reads the Pod content of the file (or filehandle) that you
	   specify, and processes it with that $parser object, according to
	   however $parser's class works, and according to whatever parser
	   options you have set up for this $parser object.

       "$parser->parse_string_document( $all_content );"
	   This works just like "parse_file" except that it reads the Pod
	   content not from a file, but from a string that you have already in
	   memory.

       "$parser->parse_lines( ...@lines..., undef );"
	   This processes the lines in @lines (where each list item must be a
	   defined value, and must contain exactly one line of content -- so
	   no items like "foo\nbar" are allowed).  The final "undef" is used
	   to indicate the end of document being parsed.

	   The other "parser_whatever" methods are meant to be called only
	   once per $parser object; but "parse_lines" can be called as many
	   times per $parser object as you want, as long as the last call (and
	   only the last call) ends with an "undef" value.

       "$parser->content_seen"
	   This returns true only if there has been any real content seen for
	   this document.

       "SomeClass->filter( $filename );"
       "SomeClass->filter( *INPUT_FH );"
       "SomeClass->filter( \$document_content );"
	   This is a shortcut method for creating a new parser object, setting
	   the output handle to STDOUT, and then processing the specified file
	   (or filehandle, or in-memory document). This is handy for one-
	   liners like this:

	     perl -MPod::Simple::Text -e "Pod::Simple::Text->filter('thingy.pod')"

SECONDARY METHODS
       Some of these methods might be of interest to general users, as well as
       of interest to formatter-writers.

       Note that the general pattern here is that the accessor-methods read
       the attribute's value with "$value = $parser->attribute" and set the
       attribute's value with "$parser->attribute(newvalue)".  For each
       accessor, I typically only mention one syntax or another, based on
       which I think you are actually most likely to use.

       "$parser->no_whining( SOMEVALUE )"
	   If you set this attribute to a true value, you will suppress the
	   parser's complaints about irregularities in the Pod coding. By
	   default, this attribute's value is false, meaning that
	   irregularities will be reported.

	   Note that turning this attribute to true won't suppress one or two
	   kinds of complaints about rarely occurring unrecoverable errors.

       "$parser->no_errata_section( SOMEVALUE )"
	   If you set this attribute to a true value, you will stop the parser
	   from generating a "POD ERRORS" section at the end of the document.
	   By default, this attribute's value is false, meaning that an errata
	   section will be generated, as necessary.

       "$parser->complain_stderr( SOMEVALUE )"
	   If you set this attribute to a true value, it will send reports of
	   parsing errors to STDERR. By default, this attribute's value is
	   false, meaning that no output is sent to STDERR.

	   Setting "complain_stderr" also sets "no_errata_section".

       "$parser->source_filename"
	   This returns the filename that this parser object was set to read
	   from.

       "$parser->doc_has_started"
	   This returns true if $parser has read from a source, and has seen
	   Pod content in it.

       "$parser->source_dead"
	   This returns true if $parser has read from a source, and come to
	   the end of that source.

       "$parser->strip_verbatim_indent( SOMEVALUE )"
	   The perlpod spec for a Verbatim paragraph is "It should be
	   reproduced exactly...", which means that the whitespace you've used
	   to indent your verbatim blocks will be preserved in the output.
	   This can be annoying for outputs such as HTML, where that
	   whitespace will remain in front of every line. It's an unfortunate
	   case where syntax is turned into semantics.

	   If the POD your parsing adheres to a consistent indentation policy,
	   you can have such indentation stripped from the beginning of every
	   line of your verbatim blocks. This method tells Pod::Simple what to
	   strip. For two-space indents, you'd use:

	     $parser->strip_verbatim_indent('  ');

	   For tab indents, you'd use a tab character:

	     $parser->strip_verbatim_indent("\t");

	   If the POD is inconsistent about the indentation of verbatim
	   blocks, but you have figured out a heuristic to determine how much
	   a particular verbatim block is indented, you can pass a code
	   reference instead. The code reference will be executed with one
	   argument, an array reference of all the lines in the verbatim
	   block, and should return the value to be stripped from each line.
	   For example, if you decide that you're fine to use the first line
	   of the verbatim block to set the standard for indentation of the
	   rest of the block, you can look at the first line and return the
	   appropriate value, like so:

	     $new->strip_verbatim_indent(sub {
		 my $lines = shift;
		 (my $indent = $lines->[0]) =~ s/\S.*//;
		 return $indent;
	     });

	   If you'd rather treat each line individually, you can do that, too,
	   by just transforming them in-place in the code reference and
	   returning "undef". Say that you don't want any lines indented. You
	   can do something like this:

	     $new->strip_verbatim_indent(sub {
		 my $lines = shift;
		 sub { s/^\s+// for @{ $lines },
		 return undef;
	     });

CAVEATS
       This is just a beta release -- there are a good number of things still
       left to do.  Notably, support for EBCDIC platforms is still half-done,
       an untested.
