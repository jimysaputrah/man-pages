NAME
       glGetPolygonStipple - return the polygon stipple pattern


C SPECIFICATION
       void glGetPolygonStipple( GLubyte *mask )


PARAMETERS
       mask  Returns the stipple pattern. The initial value is all 1's.

DESCRIPTION
       glGetPolygonStipple  returns to mask a 32 * 32 polygon stipple pattern.
       The pattern is packed into memory as if glReadPixels with  both	height
       and  width  of 32, type of GL_BITMAP, and format of GL_COLOR_INDEX were
       called, and the stipple pattern were stored in  an  internal  32  *  32
       color index buffer.  Unlike glReadPixels, however, pixel transfer oper-
       ations (shift, offset, pixel map) are not applied to the returned stip-
       ple image.

NOTES
       If an error is generated, no change is made to the contents of mask.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_OPERATION  is  generated  if glGetPolygonStipple is executed
       between the execution of glBegin and  the  corresponding  execution  of
       glEnd.
