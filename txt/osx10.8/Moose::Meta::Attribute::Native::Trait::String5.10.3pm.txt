NAME
       Moose::Meta::Attribute::Native::Trait::String - Helper trait for Str
       attributes

SYNOPSIS
	 package MyHomePage;
	 use Moose;

	 has 'text' => (
	     traits    => ['String'],
	     is        => 'rw',
	     isa       => 'Str',
	     default   => q{},
	     handles   => {
		 add_text     => 'append',
		 replace_text => 'replace',
	     },
	 );

	 my $page = MyHomePage->new();
	 $page->add_text("foo"); # same as $page->text($page->text . "foo");

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides a simple string attribute, to which mutating
       string operations can be applied more easily (no need to make an lvalue
       attribute metaclass or use temporary variables). Additional methods are
       provided for completion.

       If your attribute definition does not include any of is, isa, default
       or handles but does use the "String" metaclass, then this module
       applies defaults as in the "SYNOPSIS" above. This allows for a very
       basic string definition:

	 has 'foo' => (traits => ['String']);
	 $obj->append_foo;

PROVIDED METHODS
       These methods are implemented in
       Moose::Meta::Attribute::Native::MethodProvider::String. It is important
       to note that all those methods do in place modification of the value
       stored in the attribute.

       inc Increments the value stored in this slot using the magical string
	   autoincrement operator. Note that Perl doesn't provide analogous
	   behavior in "--", so "dec" is not available.

       append($string)
	   Append a string, like ".=".

       prepend($string)
	   Prepend a string.

       replace($pattern, $replacement)
	   Performs a regexp substitution ("s" in perlop). There is no way to
	   provide the "g" flag, but code references will be accepted for the
	   replacement, causing the regex to be modified with a single "e".
	   "/smxi" can be applied using the "qr" operator.

       match($pattern)
	   Like "replace" but without the replacement. Provided mostly for
	   completeness.

       chop
	   "chop" in perlfunc

       chomp
	   "chomp" in perlfunc

       clear
	   Sets the string to the empty string (not the value passed to
	   "default").

       length
	   "length" in perlfunc

       substr
	   "substr" in perlfunc. We go to some lengths to match the different
	   functionality based on "substr"'s arity.

METHODS
       meta
       method_provider
       has_method_provider
