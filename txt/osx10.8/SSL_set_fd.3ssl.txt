NAME
       SSL_set_fd - connect the SSL object with a file descriptor

SYNOPSIS
	#include <openssl/ssl.h>

	int SSL_set_fd(SSL *ssl, int fd);
	int SSL_set_rfd(SSL *ssl, int fd);
	int SSL_set_wfd(SSL *ssl, int fd);

DESCRIPTION
       SSL_set_fd() sets the file descriptor fd as the input/output facility
       for the TLS/SSL (encrypted) side of ssl. fd will typically be the
       socket file descriptor of a network connection.

       When performing the operation, a socket BIO is automatically created to
       interface between the ssl and fd. The BIO and hence the SSL engine
       inherit the behaviour of fd. If fd is non-blocking, the ssl will also
       have non-blocking behaviour.

       If there was already a BIO connected to ssl, BIO_free() will be called
       (for both the reading and writing side, if different).

       SSL_set_rfd() and SSL_set_wfd() perform the respective action, but only
       for the read channel or the write channel, which can be set
       independently.

RETURN VALUES
       The following return values can occur:

       0   The operation failed. Check the error stack to find out why.

       1   The operation succeeded.
