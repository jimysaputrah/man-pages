NAME
       Pod::Simple::Text -- format Pod as plaintext

SYNOPSIS
	 perl -MPod::Simple::Text -e \
	  "exit Pod::Simple::Text->filter(shift)->any_errata_seen" \
	  thingy.pod

DESCRIPTION
       This class is a formatter that takes Pod and renders it as wrapped
       plaintext.

       Its wrapping is done by Text::Wrap, so you can change
       $Text::Wrap::columns as you like.

       This is a subclass of Pod::Simple and inherits all its methods.
