NAME
       autodie::exception::system - Exceptions from autodying system().

SYNOPSIS
	   eval {
	       use autodie qw(system);

	       system($cmd, @args);

	   };

	   if (my $E = $@) {
	       say "Ooops!  ",$E->caller," had problems: $@";
	   }

DESCRIPTION
       This is a autodie::exception class for failures from the "system"
       command.

       Presently there is no way to interrogate an
       "autodie::exception::system" object for the command, exit status, and
       other information you'd expect such an object to hold.  The interface
       will be expanded to accommodate this in the future.

   stringify
       When stringified, "autodie::exception::system" objects currently use
       the message generated by IPC::System::Simple.
