NAME
       glDeleteSync - delete a sync object

C SPECIFICATION
       void glDeleteSync(GLsync sync);

PARAMETERS
       sync
	   The sync object to be deleted.

DESCRIPTION
       glDeleteSync deletes the sync object specified by sync. If the fence
       command corresponding to the specified sync object has completed, or if
       no glWaitSync() or glClientWaitSync() commands are blocking on sync,
       the object is deleted immediately. Otherwise, sync is flagged for
       deletion and will be deleted when it is no longer associated with any
       fence command and is no longer blocking any glWaitSync() or
       glClientWaitSync() command. In either case, after glDeleteSync returns,
       the name sync is invalid and can no longer be used to refer to the sync
       object.


       glDeleteSync will silently ignore a sync value of zero.

NOTES
       glSync is only supported if the GL version is 3.2 or greater, or if the
       ARB_sync extension is supported.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if sync is neither zero or the name of a
       sync object.
