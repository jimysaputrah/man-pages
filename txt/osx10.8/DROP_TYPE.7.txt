DROP TYPE(7)		PostgreSQL 9.1.4 Documentation		  DROP TYPE(7)



NAME
       DROP_TYPE - remove a data type

SYNOPSIS
       DROP TYPE [ IF EXISTS ] name [, ...] [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ]

DESCRIPTION
       DROP TYPE removes a user-defined data type. Only the owner of a type
       can remove it.

PARAMETERS
       IF EXISTS
	   Do not throw an error if the type does not exist. A notice is
	   issued in this case.

       name
	   The name (optionally schema-qualified) of the data type to remove.

       CASCADE
	   Automatically drop objects that depend on the type (such as table
	   columns, functions, operators).

       RESTRICT
	   Refuse to drop the type if any objects depend on it. This is the
	   default.

EXAMPLES
       To remove the data type box:

	   DROP TYPE box;

COMPATIBILITY
       This command is similar to the corresponding command in the SQL
       standard, apart from the IF EXISTS option, which is a PostgreSQL
       extension. But note that much of the CREATE TYPE command and the data
       type extension mechanisms in PostgreSQL differ from the SQL standard.

SEE ALSO
       ALTER TYPE (ALTER_TYPE(7)), CREATE TYPE (CREATE_TYPE(7))
