NAME
       sasl_callbacks - How to work with SASL callbacks


SYNOPSIS
       #include <sasl/sasl.h>


DESCRIPTION
       sasl_callbacks  are  used  when	the application needs some information
       from the application. Common reasons are getting for getting  usernames
       and passwords. A client MUST specify what callbacks they support in the
       sasl_client/server_init()  or  sasl_client/server_new()	calls.	If  an
       authentication mechanism needs a callback that the application does not
       state it supports it cannot be used.

       If a callback has an id parameter that should be checked to  make  sure
       you are giving the appropriate value.

       If  an application is using the client side of the library functions to
       handle the callbacks are not necessary.	Instead  the  application  may
       deal  with  callbacks via SASL_INTERACT's. See sasl_client_start/step()
       for more information.

       The list of callbacks follows:


Common Callbacks
       sasl_getopt_t
	       Get an option value

       sasl_log_t
	       Log message handler

       sasl_getpath_t
	       Get path to search for mechanisms

       sasl_verifyfile_t
	       Verify files for use by SASL

       sasl_canon_user_t
	       Username canonicalization function.


Client-only Callbacks
       sasl_getsimple_t
	       Get user/language list

       sasl_getsecret_t
	       Get authentication secret

       sasl_chalprompt_t
	       Display challenge and prompt for response

       sasl_getrealm_t
	       Get the realm for authentication


Server-only Callbacks
       sasl_authorize_t
	       Authorize policy callback

       sasl_server_userdb_checkpass_t
	       verify plaintext password

       sasl_server_userdb_setpass_t
	       set plaintext password


RETURN VALUE
       SASL callback functions should return SASL return codes. See sasl.h for
       a complete list. SASL_OK typically indicates success.
