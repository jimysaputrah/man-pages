NICE(3) 		 BSD Library Functions Manual		       NICE(3)

NAME
     nice -- set program scheduling priority

LIBRARY
     Standard C Library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <unistd.h>

     int
     nice(int incr);

DESCRIPTION
     This interface is obsoleted by setpriority(2).

     The nice() function obtains the scheduling priority of the process from
     the system and sets it to the priority value specified in incr.  The pri-
     ority is a value in the range -20 to 20.  The default priority is 0;
     lower priorities cause more favorable scheduling.	Only the super-user
     may lower priorities.

     Children inherit the priority of their parent processes via fork(2).
