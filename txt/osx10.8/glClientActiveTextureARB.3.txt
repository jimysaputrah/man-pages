NAME
       glClientActiveTextureARB - select active texture unit


C SPECIFICATION
       void glClientActiveTextureARB( GLenum texture )


PARAMETERS
       texture	Specifies  which  texture  unit  to make active. The number of
		texture units is implementation  dependent,  but  must	be  at
		least two. texture must be one of GL_TEXTUREi_ARB where 0 <= i
		< GL_MAX_TEXTURE_UNITS_ARB, which is an  implementation-depen-
		dent value.  The initial value is GL_TEXTURE0_ARB.

DESCRIPTION
       glClientActiveTextureARB  selects the vertex array client state parame-
       ters to be modified by glTexCoordPointer, and enabled or disabled  with
       glEnableClientState  or glDisableClientState, respectively, when called
       with a parameter of GL_TEXTURE_COORD_ARRAY.

NOTES
       glClientActiveTextureARB is supported only  if  GL_ARB_multitexture  is
       included  in  the  string  returned by glGetString when called with the
       argument GL_EXTENSIONS.

       glClientActiveTextureARB  sets  GL_CLIENT_ACTIVE_TEXTURE_ARB   to   the
       active texture unit.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_ENUM	is generated if texture is not one of GL_TEXTUREi_ARB,
       where 0 <= i < GL_MAX_TEXTURE_UNITS_ARB.
