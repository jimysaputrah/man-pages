NAME
       glDeleteLists - delete a contiguous group of display lists


C SPECIFICATION
       void glDeleteLists( GLuint list,
			   GLsizei range )


PARAMETERS
       list   Specifies  the integer name of the first display list to delete.

       range  Specifies the number of display lists to delete.

DESCRIPTION
       glDeleteLists causes a contiguous group of display lists to be deleted.
       list  is the name of the first display list to be deleted, and range is
       the number of display lists to delete.  All display lists d  with  list
       <= d <= list + range - 1 are deleted.

       All  storage  locations	allocated  to  the specified display lists are
       freed, and the names are available for reuse at a  later  time.	 Names
       within  the  range  that  do  not  have	an associated display list are
       ignored.  If range is 0, nothing happens.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if range is negative.

       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if glDeleteLists is executed  between
       the execution of glBegin and the corresponding execution of glEnd.
