NAME
       DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::InterBase - Driver for the Firebird RDBMS
       via DBD::InterBase

DESCRIPTION
       This driver is a subclass of
       DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::Firebird::Common for use with
       DBD::InterBase, see that driver for general details.

       You need to use either the disable_sth_caching option or
       "connect_call_use_softcommit" (see "CAVEATS") for your code to function
       correctly with this driver. Otherwise you will likely get bizarre error
       messages such as "no statement executing". The alternative is to use
       the ODBC driver, which is more suitable for long running processes such
       as under Catalyst.

       To turn on DBIx::Class::InflateColumn::DateTime support, see
       "connect_call_datetime_setup".

   connect_call_use_softcommit
       Used as:

	 on_connect_call => 'use_softcommit'

       In connect_info to set the DBD::InterBase "ib_softcommit" option.

       You need either this option or "disable_sth_caching => 1" for
       DBIx::Class code to function correctly (otherwise you may get "no
       statement executing" errors.) Or use the ODBC driver.

       The downside of using this option is that your process will NOT see
       UPDATEs, INSERTs and DELETEs from other processes for already open
       statements.

   connect_call_datetime_setup
       Used as:

	 on_connect_call => 'datetime_setup'

       In connect_info to set the date and timestamp formats using:

	 $dbh->{ib_time_all} = 'ISO';

       See DBD::InterBase for more details.

       The "TIMESTAMP" data type supports up to 4 digits after the decimal
       point for second precision. The full precision is used.

       The "DATE" data type stores the date portion only, and it MUST be
       declared with:

	 data_type => 'date'

       in your Result class.

       Timestamp columns can be declared with either "datetime" or
       "timestamp".

       You will need the DateTime::Format::Strptime module for inflation to
       work.

       For DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::ODBC::Firebird, this is a noop.

CAVEATS
       o   with "connect_call_use_softcommit", you will not be able to see
	   changes made to data in other processes. If this is an issue, use
	   disable_sth_caching as a workaround for the "no statement
	   executing" errors, this of course adversely affects performance.

	   Alternately, use the ODBC driver.
