PTHREAD_SETSPECIFIC(3)	 BSD Library Functions Manual	PTHREAD_SETSPECIFIC(3)

NAME
     pthread_setspecific -- set a thread-specific data value

SYNOPSIS
     #include <pthread.h>

     int
     pthread_setspecific(pthread_key_t key, const void *value);

DESCRIPTION
     The pthread_setspecific() function associates a thread-specific value
     with a key obtained via a previous call to pthread_key_create().  Differ-
     ent threads may bind different values to the same key.  These values are
     typically pointers to blocks of dynamically allocated memory that have
     been reserved for use by the calling thread.

     The effect of calling pthread_setspecific() with a key value not obtained
     from pthread_key_create(), or after key has been deleted with
     pthread_key_delete(), is undefined.

     pthread_setspecific() may be called from a thread-specific data destruc-
     tor function; however, this may result in lost storage or infinite loops.

RETURN VALUES
     If successful,  the pthread_setspecific() function will return zero.
     Otherwise, an error number will be returned to indicate the error.

ERRORS
     pthread_setspecific() will fail if:

     [EINVAL]		The key value is invalid.

     [ENOMEM]		Insufficient memory exists to associate the value with
			the key.

SEE ALSO

STANDARDS
     pthread_setspecific() conforms to ISO/IEC 9945-1:1996 (``POSIX.1'').
