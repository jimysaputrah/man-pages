Module::Build::YAML(3pmPerl Programmers Reference GuidModule::Build::YAML(3pm)



NAME
       Module::Build::YAML - Provides just enough YAML support so that
       Module::Build works even if YAML.pm is not installed

SYNOPSIS
	   use Module::Build::YAML;

	   ...

DESCRIPTION
       Provides just enough YAML support so that Module::Build works even if
       YAML.pm is not installed.

       Currently, this amounts to the ability to write META.yml files when
       "perl Build distmeta" is executed via the Dump() and DumpFile()
       functions/methods.
