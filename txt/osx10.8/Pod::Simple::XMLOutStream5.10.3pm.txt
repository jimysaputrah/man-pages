NAME
       Pod::Simple::XMLOutStream -- turn Pod into XML

SYNOPSIS
	 perl -MPod::Simple::XMLOutStream -e \
	  "exit Pod::Simple::XMLOutStream->filter(shift)->any_errata_seen" \
	  thingy.pod

DESCRIPTION
       Pod::Simple::XMLOutStream is a subclass of Pod::Simple that parses Pod
       and turns it into XML.

       Pod::Simple::XMLOutStream inherits methods from Pod::Simple.

SEE ALSO
       Pod::Simple::DumpAsXML is rather like this class; see its documentation
       for a discussion of the differences.

       Pod::Simple, Pod::Simple::DumpAsXML, Pod::SAX

       Pod::Simple::Subclassing

       The older (and possibly obsolete) libraries Pod::PXML, Pod::XML

ABOUT EXTENDING POD
       TODO: An example or two of =extend, then point to
       Pod::Simple::Subclassing

ASK ME!
       If you actually want to use Pod as a format that you want to render to
       XML (particularly if to an XML instance with more elements than normal
       Pod has), please email me ("sburke@cpan.org") and I'll probably have
       some recommendations.

       For reasons of concision and energetic laziness, some methods and
       options in this module (and the dozen modules it depends on) are
       undocumented; but one of those undocumented bits might be just what
       you're looking for.
