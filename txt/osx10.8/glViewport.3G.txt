NAME
       glViewport - set the viewport

C SPECIFICATION
       void glViewport(GLint x, GLint y, GLsizei width, GLsizei height);

PARAMETERS
       x, y
	   Specify the lower left corner of the viewport rectangle, in pixels.
	   The initial value is (0,0).

       width, height
	   Specify the width and height of the viewport. When a GL context is
	   first attached to a window, width and height are set to the
	   dimensions of that window.

DESCRIPTION
       glViewport specifies the affine transformation of x and y from
       normalized device coordinates to window coordinates. Let x nd y nd be
       normalized device coordinates. Then the window coordinates x w y w are
       computed as follows:


       x w = x nd + 1 ac width 2 + x


       y w = y nd + 1 ac height 2 + y

       Viewport width and height are silently clamped to a range that depends
       on the implementation. To query this range, call glGet() with argument
       GL_MAX_VIEWPORT_DIMS.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if either width or height is negative.

ASSOCIATED GETS
       glGet() with argument GL_VIEWPORT


       glGet() with argument GL_MAX_VIEWPORT_DIMS
