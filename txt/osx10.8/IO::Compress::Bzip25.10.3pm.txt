DESCRIPTION
       This module provides a Perl interface that allows writing bzip2
       compressed data to files or buffer.

       For reading bzip2 files/buffers, see the companion module
       IO::Uncompress::Bunzip2.

Functional Interface
       A top-level function, "bzip2", is provided to carry out "one-shot"
       compression between buffers and/or files. For finer control over the
       compression process, see the "OO Interface" section.

	   use IO::Compress::Bzip2 qw(bzip2 $Bzip2Error) ;

	   bzip2 $input => $output [,OPTS]
	       or die "bzip2 failed: $Bzip2Error\n";

       The functional interface needs Perl5.005 or better.

   bzip2 $input => $output [, OPTS]
       "bzip2" expects at least two parameters, $input and $output.

       The $input parameter

       The parameter, $input, is used to define the source of the uncompressed
       data.

       It can take one of the following forms:

       A filename
	    If the $input parameter is a simple scalar, it is assumed to be a
	    filename. This file will be opened for reading and the input data
	    will be read from it.

       A filehandle
	    If the $input parameter is a filehandle, the input data will be
	    read from it.  The string '-' can be used as an alias for standard
	    input.

       A scalar reference
	    If $input is a scalar reference, the input data will be read from
	    $$input.

       An array reference
	    If $input is an array reference, each element in the array must be
	    a filename.

	    The input data will be read from each file in turn.

	    The complete array will be walked to ensure that it only contains
	    valid filenames before any data is compressed.

       An Input FileGlob string
	    If $input is a string that is delimited by the characters "<" and
	    ">" "bzip2" will assume that it is an input fileglob string. The
	    input is the list of files that match the fileglob.

	    If the fileglob does not match any files ...

	    See File::GlobMapper for more details.

       If the $input parameter is any other type, "undef" will be returned.

       The $output parameter

       The parameter $output is used to control the destination of the
       compressed data. This parameter can take one of these forms.

       A filename
	    If the $output parameter is a simple scalar, it is assumed to be a
	    filename.  This file will be opened for writing and the compressed
	    data will be written to it.

       A filehandle
	    If the $output parameter is a filehandle, the compressed data will
	    be written to it.  The string '-' can be used as an alias for
	    standard output.

       A scalar reference
	    If $output is a scalar reference, the compressed data will be
	    stored in $$output.

       An Array Reference
	    If $output is an array reference, the compressed data will be
	    pushed onto the array.

       An Output FileGlob
	    If $output is a string that is delimited by the characters "<" and
	    ">" "bzip2" will assume that it is an output fileglob string. The
	    output is the list of files that match the fileglob.

	    When $output is an fileglob string, $input must also be a fileglob
	    string. Anything else is an error.

       If the $output parameter is any other type, "undef" will be returned.

   Notes
       When $input maps to multiple files/buffers and $output is a single
       file/buffer the input files/buffers will be stored in $output as a
       concatenated series of compressed data streams.

   Optional Parameters
       Unless specified below, the optional parameters for "bzip2", "OPTS",
       are the same as those used with the OO interface defined in the
       "Constructor Options" section below.

       "AutoClose => 0|1"
	    This option applies to any input or output data streams to "bzip2"
	    that are filehandles.

	    If "AutoClose" is specified, and the value is true, it will result
	    in all input and/or output filehandles being closed once "bzip2"
	    has completed.

	    This parameter defaults to 0.

       "BinModeIn => 0|1"
	    When reading from a file or filehandle, set "binmode" before
	    reading.

	    Defaults to 0.

       "Append => 0|1"
	    TODO

   Examples
       To read the contents of the file "file1.txt" and write the compressed
       data to the file "file1.txt.bz2".

	   use strict ;
	   use warnings ;
	   use IO::Compress::Bzip2 qw(bzip2 $Bzip2Error) ;

	   my $input = "file1.txt";
	   bzip2 $input => "$input.bz2"
	       or die "bzip2 failed: $Bzip2Error\n";

       To read from an existing Perl filehandle, $input, and write the
       compressed data to a buffer, $buffer.

	   use strict ;
	   use warnings ;
	   use IO::Compress::Bzip2 qw(bzip2 $Bzip2Error) ;
	   use IO::File ;

	   my $input = new IO::File "<file1.txt"
	       or die "Cannot open 'file1.txt': $!\n" ;
	   my $buffer ;
	   bzip2 $input => \$buffer
	       or die "bzip2 failed: $Bzip2Error\n";

       To compress all files in the directory "/my/home" that match "*.txt"
       and store the compressed data in the same directory

	   use strict ;
	   use warnings ;
	   use IO::Compress::Bzip2 qw(bzip2 $Bzip2Error) ;

	   bzip2 '</my/home/*.txt>' => '<*.bz2>'
	       or die "bzip2 failed: $Bzip2Error\n";

       and if you want to compress each file one at a time, this will do the
       trick

	   use strict ;
	   use warnings ;
	   use IO::Compress::Bzip2 qw(bzip2 $Bzip2Error) ;

	   for my $input ( glob "/my/home/*.txt" )
	   {
	       my $output = "$input.bz2" ;
	       bzip2 $input => $output
		   or die "Error compressing '$input': $Bzip2Error\n";
	   }

OO Interface
   Constructor
       The format of the constructor for "IO::Compress::Bzip2" is shown below

	   my $z = new IO::Compress::Bzip2 $output [,OPTS]
	       or die "IO::Compress::Bzip2 failed: $Bzip2Error\n";

       It returns an "IO::Compress::Bzip2" object on success and undef on
       failure.  The variable $Bzip2Error will contain an error message on
       failure.

       If you are running Perl 5.005 or better the object, $z, returned from
       IO::Compress::Bzip2 can be used exactly like an IO::File filehandle.
       This means that all normal output file operations can be carried out
       with $z.  For example, to write to a compressed file/buffer you can use
       either of these forms

	   $z->print("hello world\n");
	   print $z "hello world\n";

       The mandatory parameter $output is used to control the destination of
       the compressed data. This parameter can take one of these forms.

       A filename
	    If the $output parameter is a simple scalar, it is assumed to be a
	    filename. This file will be opened for writing and the compressed
	    data will be written to it.

       A filehandle
	    If the $output parameter is a filehandle, the compressed data will
	    be written to it.  The string '-' can be used as an alias for
	    standard output.

       A scalar reference
	    If $output is a scalar reference, the compressed data will be
	    stored in $$output.

       If the $output parameter is any other type, "IO::Compress::Bzip2"::new
       will return undef.

   Constructor Options
       "OPTS" is any combination of the following options:

       "AutoClose => 0|1"
	    This option is only valid when the $output parameter is a
	    filehandle. If specified, and the value is true, it will result in
	    the $output being closed once either the "close" method is called
	    or the "IO::Compress::Bzip2" object is destroyed.

	    This parameter defaults to 0.

       "Append => 0|1"
	    Opens $output in append mode.

	    The behaviour of this option is dependent on the type of $output.

	    o	 A Buffer

		 If $output is a buffer and "Append" is enabled, all
		 compressed data will be append to the end if $output.
		 Otherwise $output will be cleared before any data is written
		 to it.

	    o	 A Filename

		 If $output is a filename and "Append" is enabled, the file
		 will be opened in append mode. Otherwise the contents of the
		 file, if any, will be truncated before any compressed data is
		 written to it.

	    o	 A Filehandle

		 If $output is a filehandle, the file pointer will be
		 positioned to the end of the file via a call to "seek" before
		 any compressed data is written to it.	Otherwise the file
		 pointer will not be moved.

	    This parameter defaults to 0.

       "BlockSize100K => number"
	    Specify the number of 100K blocks bzip2 uses during compression.

	    Valid values are from 1 to 9, where 9 is best compression.

	    The default is 1.

       "WorkFactor => number"
	    Specifies how much effort bzip2 should take before resorting to a
	    slower fallback compression algorithm.

	    Valid values range from 0 to 250, where 0 means use the default
	    value 30.

	    The default is 0.

       "Strict => 0|1"
	    This is a placeholder option.

   Examples
       TODO

Methods
   print
       Usage is

	   $z->print($data)
	   print $z $data

       Compresses and outputs the contents of the $data parameter. This has
       the same behaviour as the "print" built-in.

       Returns true if successful.

   printf
       Usage is

	   $z->printf($format, $data)
	   printf $z $format, $data

       Compresses and outputs the contents of the $data parameter.

       Returns true if successful.

   syswrite
       Usage is

	   $z->syswrite $data
	   $z->syswrite $data, $length
	   $z->syswrite $data, $length, $offset

       Compresses and outputs the contents of the $data parameter.

       Returns the number of uncompressed bytes written, or "undef" if
       unsuccessful.

   write
       Usage is

	   $z->write $data
	   $z->write $data, $length
	   $z->write $data, $length, $offset

       Compresses and outputs the contents of the $data parameter.

       Returns the number of uncompressed bytes written, or "undef" if
       unsuccessful.

   flush
       Usage is

	   $z->flush;

       Flushes any pending compressed data to the output file/buffer.

       TODO

       Returns true on success.

   tell
       Usage is

	   $z->tell()
	   tell $z

       Returns the uncompressed file offset.

   eof
       Usage is

	   $z->eof();
	   eof($z);

       Returns true if the "close" method has been called.

   seek
	   $z->seek($position, $whence);
	   seek($z, $position, $whence);

       Provides a sub-set of the "seek" functionality, with the restriction
       that it is only legal to seek forward in the output file/buffer.  It is
       a fatal error to attempt to seek backward.

       Empty parts of the file/buffer will have NULL (0x00) bytes written to
       them.

       The $whence parameter takes one the usual values, namely SEEK_SET,
       SEEK_CUR or SEEK_END.

       Returns 1 on success, 0 on failure.

   binmode
       Usage is

	   $z->binmode
	   binmode $z ;

       This is a noop provided for completeness.

   opened
	   $z->opened()

       Returns true if the object currently refers to a opened file/buffer.

   autoflush
	   my $prev = $z->autoflush()
	   my $prev = $z->autoflush(EXPR)

       If the $z object is associated with a file or a filehandle, this method
       returns the current autoflush setting for the underlying filehandle. If
       "EXPR" is present, and is non-zero, it will enable flushing after every
       write/print operation.

       If $z is associated with a buffer, this method has no effect and always
       returns "undef".

       Note that the special variable $| cannot be used to set or retrieve the
       autoflush setting.

   input_line_number
	   $z->input_line_number()
	   $z->input_line_number(EXPR)

       This method always returns "undef" when compressing.

   fileno
	   $z->fileno()
	   fileno($z)

       If the $z object is associated with a file or a filehandle, "fileno"
       will return the underlying file descriptor. Once the "close" method is
       called "fileno" will return "undef".

       If the $z object is is associated with a buffer, this method will
       return "undef".

   close
	   $z->close() ;
	   close $z ;

       Flushes any pending compressed data and then closes the output
       file/buffer.

       For most versions of Perl this method will be automatically invoked if
       the IO::Compress::Bzip2 object is destroyed (either explicitly or by
       the variable with the reference to the object going out of scope). The
       exceptions are Perl versions 5.005 through 5.00504 and 5.8.0. In these
       cases, the "close" method will be called automatically, but not until
       global destruction of all live objects when the program is terminating.

       Therefore, if you want your scripts to be able to run on all versions
       of Perl, you should call "close" explicitly and not rely on automatic
       closing.

       Returns true on success, otherwise 0.

       If the "AutoClose" option has been enabled when the IO::Compress::Bzip2
       object was created, and the object is associated with a file, the
       underlying file will also be closed.

   newStream([OPTS])
       Usage is

	   $z->newStream( [OPTS] )

       Closes the current compressed data stream and starts a new one.

       OPTS consists of any of the the options that are available when
       creating the $z object.

       See the "Constructor Options" section for more details.
