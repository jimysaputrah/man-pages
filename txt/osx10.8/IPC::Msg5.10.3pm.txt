NAME
       IPC::Msg - SysV Msg IPC object class

SYNOPSIS
	   use IPC::SysV qw(IPC_PRIVATE S_IRUSR S_IWUSR);
	   use IPC::Msg;

	   $msg = IPC::Msg->new(IPC_PRIVATE, S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR);

	   $msg->snd(pack("l! a*",$msgtype,$msg));

	   $msg->rcv($buf,256);

	   $ds = $msg->stat;

	   $msg->remove;

DESCRIPTION
       A class providing an object based interface to SysV IPC message queues.

METHODS
       new ( KEY , FLAGS )
	   Creates a new message queue associated with "KEY". A new queue is
	   created if

	   o   "KEY" is equal to "IPC_PRIVATE"

	   o   "KEY" does not already have a message queue associated with it,
	       and "FLAGS & IPC_CREAT" is true.

	   On creation of a new message queue "FLAGS" is used to set the
	   permissions.  Be careful not to set any flags that the Sys V IPC
	   implementation does not allow: in some systems setting execute bits
	   makes the operations fail.

       id  Returns the system message queue identifier.

       rcv ( BUF, LEN [, TYPE [, FLAGS ]] )
	   Read a message from the queue. Returns the type of the message
	   read.  See msgrcv.  The  BUF becomes tainted.

       remove
	   Remove and destroy the message queue from the system.

       set ( STAT )
       set ( NAME => VALUE [, NAME => VALUE ...] )
	   "set" will set the following values of the "stat" structure
	   associated with the message queue.

	       uid
	       gid
	       mode (oly the permission bits)
	       qbytes

	   "set" accepts either a stat object, as returned by the "stat"
	   method, or a list of name-value pairs.

       snd ( TYPE, MSG [, FLAGS ] )
	   Place a message on the queue with the data from "MSG" and with type
	   "TYPE".  See msgsnd.

       stat
	   Returns an object of type "IPC::Msg::stat" which is a sub-class of
	   "Class::Struct". It provides the following fields. For a
	   description of these fields see you system documentation.

	       uid
	       gid
	       cuid
	       cgid
	       mode
	       qnum
	       qbytes
	       lspid
	       lrpid
	       stime
	       rtime
	       ctime
