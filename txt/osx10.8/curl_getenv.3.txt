NAME
       curl_getenv - return value for environment name

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curl/curl.h>

       char *curl_getenv(const char *name);

DESCRIPTION
       curl_getenv() is a portable wrapper for the getenv() function, meant to
       emulate its behaviour and provide an identical interface for all  oper-
       ating systems libcurl builds on (including win32).

AVAILABILITY
       This  function  will  be  removed from the public libcurl API in a near
       future. It will instead be made "available" by source code access only,
       and then as curlx_getenv().

RETURN VALUE
       If  successful,	curl_getenv()  returns	a  pointer to the value of the
       specified environment. The memory it refers to  is  malloc()ed  so  the
       application  must  free()  this when the data is no longer needed. When
       curl_getenv(3) fails to find the specified  name,  it  returns  a  null
       pointer.

NOTE
       Under  unix  operating  systems,  there isn't any point in returning an
       allocated memory, although other systems won't work  properly  if  this
       isn't  done.  The  unix implementation thus has to suffer slightly from
       the drawbacks of other systems.
