NAME
       Net::DNS::RR::IPSECKEY - DNS DHCID resource record

SYNOPSIS
       "use Net::DNS::RR";

DESCRIPTION
       CLASS for the DHCID RR.

METHODS
   identifiertype
       Returns the value of the identifiertype field.

   identifiertype
       Returns the value of the digesttype field.

   digest
       Returns the value of the digest in base64 encoding.

   digestbin
       Returns the value of the digest.

TODO/NOTES
       While the various accessor methods can be used to read and set values
       the setting of values is discouraged as those are not properly tested.

       There should be a creator method that takes the identifier and fqnds as
       input and generates all fields with some knowledge of RFC4703.
