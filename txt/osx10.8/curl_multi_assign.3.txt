NAME
       curl_multi_assign - set data to association with an internal socket

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curl/curl.h>

       CURLMcode curl_multi_assign(CURLM *multi_handle, curl_socket_t sockfd,
				   void *sockptr);

DESCRIPTION
       This  function  assigns	an association in the multi handle between the
       given socket and a private pointer of the application. This  is	(only)
       useful for curl_multi_socket(3) uses.

       When set, the sockptr pointer will be passed to all future socket call-
       backs for the specific sockfd socket.

       If the given sockfd isn't already in use by libcurl, this function will
       return an error.

       libcurl	only  keeps  one  single  pointer associated with a socket, so
       calling this function several times for the same socket will  make  the
       last set pointer get used.

       The  idea  here being that this association (socket to private pointer)
       is something that just about every application that uses this API  will
       need  and  then	libcurl can just as well do it since it already has an
       internal hash table lookup for this.

RETURN VALUE
       The standard CURLMcode for multi interface error codes.

TYPICAL USAGE
       In a typical application you allocate a struct or  at  least  use  some
       kind  of semi-dynamic data for each socket that we must wait for action
       on when using the curl_multi_socket(3) approach.

       When our socket-callback gets called by libcurl	and  we  get  to  know
       about  yet  another socket to wait for, we can use curl_multi_assign(3)
       to point out the particular data so that when we get updates about this
       same  socket  again,  we  don't have to find the struct associated with
       this socket by ourselves.

AVAILABILITY
       This function was added in libcurl 7.15.5, although not	deemed	stable
       yet.
