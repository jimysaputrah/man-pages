DESCRIPTION

     The utime() function sets the access and modification times of the named

     pointed at by times.

     If the times are specified (the times argument is non-NULL), the caller
     must be the owner of the file or be the super-user.

     If the times are not specified (the times argument is NULL), the caller
     must be the owner of the file, have permission to write the file, or be
     the super-user.

ERRORS
     The utime() function may fail and set errno for any of the errors speci-
     fied for the library function utimes(2).

SEE ALSO
