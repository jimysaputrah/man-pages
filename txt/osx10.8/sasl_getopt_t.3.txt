NAME
       sasl_getopt_t - The SASL get option callback



SYNOPSIS
       #include <sasl/sasl.h>


       int sasl_getopt_t(void *context,
		      const char *plugin_name,
		      const char *option,
		      const char ** result,
		      unsigned * len);


DESCRIPTION
       sasl_getopt_t  is used to retrieve an option, often mechanism specific,
       from the application. An example of this is requested what  KERBEROS_V4
       srvtab  file  to  use.	plugin_name  is  the plugin this value if for.
       option is a string representing the option. A common  option  that  all
       server  applications  should  handle  is  method for checking plaintext
       passwords. See the administrators guide for a full description of  this
       option.

       Memory  management of options supplied by the getopt callback should be
       done by the application, however,  any  requested  option  must	remain
       available  until  the  callback	is  no	longer	valid.	 That is, when
       sasl_dispose is called for a the connection it is associated  with,  or
       sasl_done is called for global callbacks.


RETURN VALUE
       SASL callback functions should return SASL return codes. See sasl.h for
       a complete list. SASL_OK indicates success.
