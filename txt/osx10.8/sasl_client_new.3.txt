NAME
       sasl_client_new - Create a new client authentication object



SYNOPSIS
       #include <sasl/sasl.h>

       int sasl_client_new(const char *service,
		       const char *serverFQDN,
		       const char *iplocalport,
		       const char *ipremoteport,
		       const sasl_callback_t *prompt_supp,
		       unsigned flags,
		       sasl_conn_t ** pconn);


DESCRIPTION
       sasl_client_new() creates a new SASL context. This context will be used
       for all SASL calls for one connection. It handles  both	authentication
       and integrity/encyption layers after authentication.

       service	is  the  registered  name of the service (usually the protocol
       name) using SASL (e.g. "imap").

       serverFQDN is the fully qualified  domain  name	of  the  server  (e.g.
       "serverhost.cmu.edu").

       iplocalport  is the IP and port of the local side of the connection, or
       NULL.  If iplocalport is NULL it will disable mechanisms  that  require
       IP  address  information.  This strings must be in one of the following
       formats:  "a.b.c.d;port"  (IPv4),  "e:f:g:h:i:j:k:l;port"  (IPv6),   or
       "e:f:g:h:i:j:a.b.c.d;port" (IPv6)

       ipremoteport  is  the IP and port of the remote side of the connection,
       or NULL (see iplocalport)

       prompt_supp is a list of client interactions supported that  is	unique
       to  this  connection.  If  this	parameter is NULL the global callbacks
       (specified in sasl_client_init) will be	used.  See  sasl_callback  for
       more information.

       flags are connection flags (see below)

       pconn is the conection context allocated by the library. This structure
       will be used for all future SASL calls for this connection.

       Connection Flags

       Flags that may be passed to sasl_server_new() include

       SASL_SUCCESS_DATA
	       The protocol supports a server-last send

       SASL_NEED_PROXY
	       Force the use of a mechanism that supports an authorization  id
	       that is not the authentication id.


RETURN VALUE
       sasl_client_new returns an integer which corresponds to one of the fol-
       lowing codes. SASL_OK is the only one that indicates success. All  oth-
       ers  indicate errors and should either be handled or the authentication
       session should be quit.


ERRORS
       SASL_OK Success

       SASL_BADPARAM
	       Error in config file or passed parameters

       SASL_NOMECH
	       No mechanism meets requested properties

       SASL_NOMEM
	       Not enough memory to complete operation
