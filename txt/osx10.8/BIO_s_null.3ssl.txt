NAME
       BIO_s_null - null data sink

SYNOPSIS
	#include <openssl/bio.h>

	BIO_METHOD *   BIO_s_null(void);

DESCRIPTION
       BIO_s_null() returns the null sink BIO method. Data written to the null
       sink is discarded, reads return EOF.

NOTES
       A null sink BIO behaves in a similar manner to the Unix /dev/null
       device.

       A null bio can be placed on the end of a chain to discard any data
       passed through it.

       A null sink is useful if, for example, an application wishes to digest
       some data by writing through a digest bio but not send the digested
       data anywhere.  Since a BIO chain must normally include a source/sink
       BIO this can be achieved by adding a null sink BIO to the end of the
       chain

RETURN VALUES
       BIO_s_null() returns the null sink BIO method.
