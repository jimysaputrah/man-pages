NAME
       Sys::Hostname::Long - Try every conceivable way to get full hostname

SYNOPSIS
	   use Sys::Hostname::Long;
	   $host_long = hostname_long;

DESCRIPTION
       How to get the host full name in perl on multiple operating systems
       (mac, windows, unix* etc)

DISCUSSION
       This is the SECOND release of this code. It has an improved set of
       tests and improved interfaces - but it is still often failing to get a
       full host name.	This of course is the reason I wrote the module, it is
       difficult to get full host names accurately on each system. On some
       systems (eg: Linux) it is dependent on the order of the entries in
       /etc/hosts.

       To make it easier to test I have testall.pl to generate an output list
       of all methods. Thus even if the logic is incorrect, it may be possible
       to get the full name.

       Attempt via many methods to get the systems full name. The
       Sys::Hostname class is the best and standard way to get the system
       hostname. However it is missing the long hostname.

       Special thanks to David Sundstrom and Greg Bacon for the original
       Sys::Hostname

       THIS IS IN NEED OF AN UPDATE AFTER NEXT RELEASE.

KNOWN LIMITATIONS
   Unix
       Most unix systems have trouble working out the fully quallified domain
       name as it to be configured somewhere in the system correctly. For
       example in most linux systems (debian, ?) the fully qualified name
       should be the first entry next to the ip number in /etc/hosts

       If it is the other way around, it will fail.
