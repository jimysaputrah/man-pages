NAME
       Moose::Meta::TypeCoercion - The Moose Type Coercion metaclass

DESCRIPTION
       A type coercion object is basically a mapping of one or more type
       constraints and the associated coercions subroutines.

       It's unlikely that you will need to instantiate an object of this class
       directly, as it's part of the deep internals of Moose.

METHODS
       Moose::Meta::TypeCoercion->new(%options)
	   Creates a new type coercion object, based on the options provided.

	   o	   type_constraint

		   This is the Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint object for the type
		   that is being coerced to.

       $coercion->type_coercion_map
	   This returns the map of type constraints to coercions as an array
	   reference. The values of the array alternate between type names and
	   subroutine references which implement the coercion.

	   The value is an array reference because coercions are tried in the
	   order they are added.

       $coercion->type_constraint
	   This returns the Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint that was passed to the
	   constructor.

       $coercion->has_coercion_for_type($type_name)
	   Returns true if the coercion can coerce the named type.

       $coercion->add_type_coercions( $type_name => $sub, ... )
	   This method takes a list of type names and subroutine references.
	   If the coercion already has a mapping for a given type, it throws
	   an exception.

	   Coercions are actually

       $coercion->coerce($value)
	   This method takes a value and applies the first valid coercion it
	   finds.

	   This means that if the value could belong to more than type in the
	   coercion object, the first coercion added is used.

       Moose::Meta::TypeCoercion->meta
	   This will return a Class::MOP::Class instance for this class.
