NAME
       glFenceSync - create a new sync object and insert it into the GL
       command stream

C SPECIFICATION
       GLsync glFenceSync(GLenum condition, GLbitfield flags);

PARAMETERS
       condition
	   Specifies the condition that must be met to set the sync object's
	   state to signaled.  condition must be
	   GL_SYNC_GPU_COMMANDS_COMPLETE.

       flags
	   Specifies a bitwise combination of flags controlling the behavior
	   of the sync object. No flags are presently defined for this
	   operation and flags must be zero.[1]

DESCRIPTION
       glFenceSync creates a new fence sync object, inserts a fence command
       into the GL command stream and associates it with that sync object, and
       returns a non-zero name corresponding to the sync object.

       When the specified condition of the sync object is satisfied by the
       fence command, the sync object is signaled by the GL, causing any
       glWaitSync(), glClientWaitSync() commands blocking in sync to unblock.
       No other state is affected by glFenceSync or by the execution of the
       associated fence command.


       condition must be GL_SYNC_GPU_COMMANDS_COMPLETE. This condition is
       satisfied by completion of the fence command corresponding to the sync
       object and all preceding commands in the same command stream. The sync
       object will not be signaled until all effects from these commands on GL
       client and server state and the framebuffer are fully realized. Note
       that completion of the fence command occurs once the state of the
       corresponding sync object has been changed, but commands waiting on
       that sync object may not be unblocked until after the fence command
       completes.

NOTES
       glFenceSync is only supported if the GL version is 3.2 or greater, or
       if
		   the ARB_sync extension is supported.
	   .SH "ERRORS"


       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if condition is not
       GL_SYNC_GPU_COMMANDS_COMPLETE.


       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if flags is not zero.

       Additionally, if glFenceSync fails, it will return zero.
