SPI_EXECUTE_PLAN(3)	PostgreSQL 9.1.4 Documentation	   SPI_EXECUTE_PLAN(3)



NAME
       SPI_execute_plan - execute a plan prepared by SPI_prepare

SYNOPSIS
       int SPI_execute_plan(SPIPlanPtr plan, Datum * values, const char * nulls,
			    bool read_only, long count)

DESCRIPTION
       SPI_execute_plan executes a plan prepared by SPI_prepare.  read_only
       and count have the same interpretation as in SPI_execute.

ARGUMENTS
       SPIPlanPtr plan
	   execution plan (returned by SPI_prepare)

       Datum * values
	   An array of actual parameter values. Must have same length as the
	   plan's number of arguments.

       const char * nulls
	   An array describing which parameters are null. Must have same
	   length as the plan's number of arguments.  n indicates a null value
	   (entry in values will be ignored); a space indicates a nonnull
	   value (entry in values is valid).

	   If nulls is NULL then SPI_execute_plan assumes that no parameters
	   are null.

       bool read_only
	   true for read-only execution

       long count
	   maximum number of rows to process or return

RETURN VALUE
       The return value is the same as for SPI_execute, with the following
       additional possible error (negative) results:

       SPI_ERROR_ARGUMENT
	   if plan is NULL or invalid, or count is less than 0

       SPI_ERROR_PARAM
	   if values is NULL and plan was prepared with some parameters


       SPI_processed and SPI_tuptable are set as in SPI_execute if successful.
