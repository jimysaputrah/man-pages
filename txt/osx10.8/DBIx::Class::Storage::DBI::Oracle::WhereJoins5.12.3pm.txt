NAME
       DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::Oracle::WhereJoins - Oracle joins in WHERE
       syntax support (instead of ANSI).

PURPOSE
       This module is used with Oracle < 9.0 due to lack of support for
       standard ANSI join syntax.

SYNOPSIS
       DBIx::Class should automagically detect Oracle and use this module with
       no work from you.

DESCRIPTION
       This class implements Oracle's WhereJoin support.  Instead of:

	   SELECT x FROM y JOIN z ON y.id = z.id

       It will write:

	   SELECT x FROM y, z WHERE y.id = z.id

       It should properly support left joins, and right joins.	Full outer
       joins are not possible due to the fact that Oracle requires the entire
       query be written to union the results of a left and right join, and by
       the time this module is called to create the where query and table
       definition part of the SQL query, it's already too late.

METHODS
       See DBIx::Class::SQLMaker::OracleJoins for implementation details.

BUGS
       Does not support full outer joins.  Probably lots more.
