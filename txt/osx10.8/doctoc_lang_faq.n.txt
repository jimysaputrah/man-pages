DESCRIPTION
OVERVIEW
   WHAT IS THIS DOCUMENT?
       This document is currently mainly a placeholder, to be filled with com-
       monly asked questions about the doctoc markup language and  companions,
       and their answers.

       Please  report any questions (and, if possible, answers) we should con-
       sider for this document in the  category  doctools  of  the  Tcllib  SF
       Trackers [http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=12883].

EXAMPLES
   WHERE DO I FIND DOCTOC EXAMPLES?
       We  have  no  direct examples of documents written using doctoc markup.
       However the doctools processor dtplite does generate a  table  of  con-
       tents  when  processing	a set of documents written in doctools markup.
       The intermediate file for it uses doctoc markup and is not deleted when
       generation completes. Such files can therefore serve as examples.

       dtplite is distributed as part of Tcllib, so to get it you need one of

       [1]    A  CVS  snapshot	of Tcllib. How to retrieve such a snapshot and
	      the tools required for  this  are  described  at	http://source-
	      forge.net/cvs/?group_id=12883

       [2]    A  Tcllib  release archive. They are available at http://source-
	      forge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=12883
