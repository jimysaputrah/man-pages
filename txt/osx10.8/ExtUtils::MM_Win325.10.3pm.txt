NAME
       ExtUtils::MM_Win32 - methods to override UN*X behaviour in
       ExtUtils::MakeMaker

SYNOPSIS
	use ExtUtils::MM_Win32; # Done internally by ExtUtils::MakeMaker if needed

DESCRIPTION
       See ExtUtils::MM_Unix for a documentation of the methods provided
       there. This package overrides the implementation of these methods, not
       the semantics.

   Overridden methods
       dlsyms
       replace_manpage_separator
	   Changes the path separator with .

       maybe_command
	   Since Windows has nothing as simple as an executable bit, we check
	   the file extension.

	   The PATHEXT env variable will be used to get a list of extensions
	   that might indicate a command, otherwise .com, .exe, .bat and .cmd
	   will be used by default.

       init_DIRFILESEP
	   Using \ for Windows.

       init_others
	   Override some of the Unix specific commands with portable
	   ExtUtils::Command ones.

	   Also provide defaults for LD and AR in case the %Config values
	   aren't set.

	   LDLOADLIBS's default is changed to $Config{libs}.

	   Adjustments are made for Borland's quirks needing -L to come first.

       init_platform
	   Add MM_Win32_VERSION.

       platform_constants
       special_targets
	   Add .USESHELL target for dmake.

       static_lib
	   Changes how to run the linker.

	   The rest is duplicate code from MM_Unix.  Should move the linker
	   code to its own method.

       dynamic_lib
	   Complicated stuff for Win32 that I don't understand. :(

       extra_clean_files
	   Clean out some extra dll.{base,exp} files which might be generated
	   by gcc.  Otherwise, take out all *.pdb files.

       init_linker
       perl_script
	   Checks for the perl program under several common perl extensions.

       xs_o
	   This target is stubbed out.	Not sure why.

       pasthru
	   All we send is -nologo to nmake to prevent it from printing its
	   damned banner.

       arch_check (override)
	   Normalize all arguments for consistency of comparison.

       oneliner
	   These are based on what command.com does on Win98.  They may be
	   wrong for other Windows shells, I don't know.

       cd  dmake can handle Unix style cd'ing but nmake (at least 1.5) cannot.
	   It wants:

	       cd dir1\dir2
	       command
	       another_command
	       cd ..\..

       max_exec_len
	   nmake 1.50 limits command length to 2048 characters.

       os_flavor
	   Windows is Win32.

       cflags
	   Defines the PERLDLL symbol if we are configured for static building
	   since all code destined for the perl5xx.dll must be compiled with
	   the PERLDLL symbol defined.
