NAME
       glutCreateWindow - creates a top-level window.

SYNTAX
       #include <GLUT/glut.h>

       int glutCreateWindow(char *name);

ARGUMENTS
       name	 ASCII character string for use as window name.

DESCRIPTION
       glutCreateWindow  creates a top-level window. The name will be provided
       to the window system as the window's name. The intent is that the  win-
       dow system will label the window with the name.

       Implicitly, the current window is set to the newly created window.

       Each  created  window  has  a  unique  associated OpenGL context. State
       changes to a window's associated OpenGL context can be done immediately
       after the window is created.

       The  display state of a window is initially for the window to be shown.
       But the window's display state is not actually acted upon  until  glut-
       MainLoop is entered. This means until glutMainLoop is called, rendering
       to a created window is ineffective because the window can  not  yet  be
       displayed.

       The value returned is a unique small integer identifier for the window.
       The range of allocated identifiers starts at one. This  window  identi-
       fier can be used when calling glutSetWindow.

X IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
       The proper X Inter-Client Communication Conventions Manual (ICCCM) top-
       level properties are established. The WM_COMMAND  property  that  lists
       the  command  line  used to invoke the GLUT program is only established
       for the first window created.
