NAME
       User::grent - by-name interface to Perl's built-in getgr*() functions

SYNOPSIS
	use User::grent;
	$gr = getgrgid(0) or die "No group zero";
	if ( $gr->name eq 'wheel' && @{$gr->members} > 1 ) {
	    print "gid zero name wheel, with other members";
	}

	use User::grent qw(:FIELDS);
	getgrgid(0) or die "No group zero";
	if ( $gr_name eq 'wheel' && @gr_members > 1 ) {
	    print "gid zero name wheel, with other members";
	}

	$gr = getgr($whoever);

DESCRIPTION
       This module's default exports override the core getgrent(), getgruid(),
       and getgrnam() functions, replacing them with versions that return
       "User::grent" objects.  This object has methods that return the
       similarly named structure field name from the C's passwd structure from
       grp.h; namely name, passwd, gid, and members (not mem).	The first
       three return scalars, the last an array reference.

       You may also import all the structure fields directly into your
       namespace as regular variables using the :FIELDS import tag.  (Note
       that this still overrides your core functions.)	Access these fields as
       variables named with a preceding "gr_".	Thus, "$group_obj->gid()"
       corresponds to $gr_gid if you import the fields.  Array references are
       available as regular array variables, so "@{ $group_obj->members() }"
       would be simply @gr_members.

       The getpw() function is a simple front-end that forwards a numeric
       argument to getpwuid() and the rest to getpwnam().

       To access this functionality without the core overrides, pass the "use"
       an empty import list, and then access function functions with their
       full qualified names.  On the other hand, the built-ins are still
       available via the "CORE::" pseudo-package.

NOTE
       While this class is currently implemented using the Class::Struct
       module to build a struct-like class, you shouldn't rely upon this.
