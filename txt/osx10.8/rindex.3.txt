     rindex -- locate character in string

LIBRARY
     Standard C Library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <strings.h>

     char *
     rindex(const char *s, int c);

DESCRIPTION
     The rindex() function locates the last character matching c (converted to
     a char) in the null-terminated string s.

RETURN VALUES
     A pointer to the character is returned if it is found; otherwise, NULL is
     returned.	If c is `\0', rindex() locates the terminating `\0'.

HISTORY
     A rindex() function appeared in Version 6 AT&T UNIX.  Its prototype
     existed previously in <string.h> before it was moved to <strings.h> for
