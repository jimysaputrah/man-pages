DROP CONVERSION(7)	PostgreSQL 9.1.4 Documentation	    DROP CONVERSION(7)



NAME
       DROP_CONVERSION - remove a conversion

SYNOPSIS
       DROP CONVERSION [ IF EXISTS ] name [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ]

DESCRIPTION
       DROP CONVERSION removes a previously defined conversion. To be able to
       drop a conversion, you must own the conversion.

PARAMETERS
       IF EXISTS
	   Do not throw an error if the conversion does not exist. A notice is
	   issued in this case.

       name
	   The name of the conversion. The conversion name can be
	   schema-qualified.

       CASCADE, RESTRICT
	   These key words do not have any effect, since there are no
	   dependencies on conversions.

EXAMPLES
       To drop the conversion named myname:

	   DROP CONVERSION myname;

COMPATIBILITY
       There is no DROP CONVERSION statement in the SQL standard, but a DROP
       TRANSLATION statement that goes along with the CREATE TRANSLATION
       statement that is similar to the CREATE CONVERSION statement in
       PostgreSQL.

SEE ALSO
       ALTER CONVERSION (ALTER_CONVERSION(7)), CREATE CONVERSION
       (CREATE_CONVERSION(7))
