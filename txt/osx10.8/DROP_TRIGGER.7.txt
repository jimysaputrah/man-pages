DROP TRIGGER(7) 	PostgreSQL 9.1.4 Documentation	       DROP TRIGGER(7)



NAME
       DROP_TRIGGER - remove a trigger

SYNOPSIS
       DROP TRIGGER [ IF EXISTS ] name ON table [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ]

DESCRIPTION
       DROP TRIGGER removes an existing trigger definition. To execute this
       command, the current user must be the owner of the table for which the
       trigger is defined.

PARAMETERS
       IF EXISTS
	   Do not throw an error if the trigger does not exist. A notice is
	   issued in this case.

       name
	   The name of the trigger to remove.

       table
	   The name (optionally schema-qualified) of the table for which the
	   trigger is defined.

       CASCADE
	   Automatically drop objects that depend on the trigger.

       RESTRICT
	   Refuse to drop the trigger if any objects depend on it. This is the
	   default.

EXAMPLES
       Destroy the trigger if_dist_exists on the table films:

	   DROP TRIGGER if_dist_exists ON films;

COMPATIBILITY
       The DROP TRIGGER statement in PostgreSQL is incompatible with the SQL
       standard. In the SQL standard, trigger names are not local to tables,
       so the command is simply DROP TRIGGER name.
