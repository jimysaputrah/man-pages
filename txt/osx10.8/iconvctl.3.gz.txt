NAME
       iconvctl - control iconv behavior

SYNOPSIS
       #include <iconv.h>

       int iconvctl (iconv_t cd , int request, void * argument);

DESCRIPTION
       The argument cd must be a conversion descriptor created using the func-
       tion iconv_open.

       iconvctl queries or adjusts the behavior of the	iconv  function,  when
       invoked	with  the  specified  conversion  descriptor, depending on the
       request value.

REQUEST VALUES
       The following are permissible values for the request parameter.

       ICONV_TRIVIALP
	      argument should be an int * which will receive 1 if the  conver-
	      sion is trivial, or 0 otherwise.

       ICONV_GET_TRANSLITERATE
	      argument should be an int * which will receive 1 if translitera-
	      tion is enabled in the conversion, or 0 otherwise.

       ICONV_SET_TRANSLITERATE
	      argument should be a const int *, pointing to an int  value.   A
	      non-zero	value is used to enable transliteration in the conver-
	      sion. A zero value disables it.

       ICONV_GET_DISCARD_ILSEQ
	      argument should be an int * which will  receive  1  if  "illegal
	      sequence	discard and continue" is enabled in the conversion, or
	      0 otherwise.

       ICONV_SET_DISCARD_ILSEQ
	      argument should be a const int *, pointing to an int  value.   A
	      non-zero	value  is used to enable "illegal sequence discard and
	      continue" in the conversion. A zero value disables it.

RETURN VALUE
       The iconvctl function returns 0 if it succeeds. In case	of  error,  it
       sets errno and returns -1.

ERRORS
       The following errors can occur, among others:

       EINVAL The request is invalid.

CONFORMING TO
       This  function  is  implemented	only  in GNU libiconv and not in other
       iconv implementations. It is not backed by a standard. You can test for
       its presence through (_LIBICONV_VERSION >= 0x0108).
