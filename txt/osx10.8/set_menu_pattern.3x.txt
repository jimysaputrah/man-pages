NAME
       menu_pattern - get and set a menu's pattern buffer

SYNOPSIS
       #include <menu.h>
       int set_menu_pattern(MENU *menu, const char *pattern);
       char *menu_pattern(const MENU *menu);

DESCRIPTION
       Every  menu  has  an  associated pattern match buffer.  As input events
       that are printable characters come in, they are appended to this  match
       buffer and tested for a match, as described in menu_driver(3X).

       The  function  set_menu_pattern	sets  the pattern buffer for the given
       menu and tries to find the first matching item.	If it  succeeds,  that
       item becomes current; if not, the current item does not change.

       The function menu_pattern returns the pattern buffer of the given menu.

RETURN VALUE
       The function menu_pattern returns a pointer, which is NULL if the  menu
       parameter  is  NULL.   Otherwise,  it is a pointer to a string which is
       empty if no pattern has been set.  It does not set errno.

       The function set_menu_pattern may return the following error codes:

       E_OK The routine succeeded.

       E_BAD_ARGUMENT
	    Routine detected an incorrect or out-of-range argument.

       E_BAD_STATE
	    Routine was called from an initialization or termination function.

       E_NOT_CONNECTED
	    No items are connected to menu.

       E_NO_MATCH
	    Character failed to match.

       E_SYSTEM_ERROR
	    System error occurred (see errno).

NOTES
       The  header  file  <menu.h>  automatically  includes  the  header  file
       <curses.h>.

PORTABILITY
       These routines emulate the System V menu library.  They were  not  sup-
       ported on Version 7 or BSD versions.
