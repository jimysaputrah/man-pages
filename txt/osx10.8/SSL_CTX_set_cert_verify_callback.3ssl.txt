NAME
       SSL_CTX_set_cert_verify_callback - set peer certificate verification
       procedure

SYNOPSIS
	#include <openssl/ssl.h>

	void SSL_CTX_set_cert_verify_callback(SSL_CTX *ctx, int (*callback)(X509_STORE_CTX *,void *), void *arg);

DESCRIPTION
       SSL_CTX_set_cert_verify_callback() sets the verification callback
       function for ctx. SSL objects that are created from ctx inherit the
       setting valid at the time when SSL_new(3) is called.

NOTES
       Whenever a certificate is verified during a SSL/TLS handshake, a
       verification function is called. If the application does not explicitly
       specify a verification callback function, the built-in verification
       function is used.  If a verification callback callback is specified via
       SSL_CTX_set_cert_verify_callback(), the supplied callback function is
       called instead. By setting callback to NULL, the default behaviour is
       restored.

       When the verification must be performed, callback will be called with
       the arguments callback(X509_STORE_CTX *x509_store_ctx, void *arg). The
       argument arg is specified by the application when setting callback.

       callback should return 1 to indicate verification success and 0 to
       indicate verification failure. If SSL_VERIFY_PEER is set and callback
       returns 0, the handshake will fail. As the verification procedure may
       allow to continue the connection in case of failure (by always
       returning 1) the verification result must be set in any case using the
       error member of x509_store_ctx so that the calling application will be
       informed about the detailed result of the verification procedure!

       Within x509_store_ctx, callback has access to the verify_callback
       function set using SSL_CTX_set_verify(3).

WARNINGS
       Do not mix the verification callback described in this function with
       the verify_callback function called during the verification process.
       The latter is set using the SSL_CTX_set_verify(3) family of functions.

       Providing a complete verification procedure including certificate
       purpose settings etc is a complex task. The built-in procedure is quite
       powerful and in most cases it should be sufficient to modify its
       behaviour using the verify_callback function.

BUGS
RETURN VALUES
       SSL_CTX_set_cert_verify_callback() does not provide diagnostic
       information.

HISTORY
       Previous to OpenSSL 0.9.7, the arg argument to
       SSL_CTX_set_cert_verify_callback was ignored, and callback was called
       simply as
	int (*callback)(X509_STORE_CTX *) To compile software written for
       previous versions of OpenSSL, a dummy argument will have to be added to
       callback.
