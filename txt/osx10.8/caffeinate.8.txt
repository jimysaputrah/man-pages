NAME
     caffeinate -- prevent the system from sleeping on behalf of a utility

SYNOPSIS
     caffeinate [-disu] [-t timeout] [utility] [argument ...]

DESCRIPTION
     caffeinate creates assertions to alter system sleep behavior.  If no
     assertion flags are specified, caffeinate creates an assertion to prevent
     idle sleep.  If a utility is specified, caffeinate creates the assertions
     on the utility's behalf, and those assertions will persist for the dura-
     tion of the utility's execution. Otherwise, caffeinate creates the asser-
     tions directly, and those assertions will persist until caffeinate exits.

     Available options:

     -d      Create an assertion to prevent the display from sleeping.

     -i      Create an assertion to prevent the system from idle sleeping.

     -s      Create an assertion to prevent the system from sleeping. This
	     assertion is valid only when system is running on AC power.

     -u      Create an assertion to declare that user is active. If the dis-
	     play is off, this option turns the display on and prevents the
	     display from going into idle sleep. If a timeout is not specified
	     with '-t' option, then this assertion is taken with a default of
	     5 second timeout.

     -t      Specifies the timeout value in seconds for which this assertion
	     has to be valid. The assertion is dropped after the specified
	     timeout. Timeout value is not used when an utility is invoked
	     with this command.
