DESCRIPTION
       A "PPI::Statement::Include::Perl6" is a special include statement that
       indicates the start of a section of Perl 6 code inlined into a regular
       Perl 5 code file.

       The primary purpose of the class is to allow PPI to provide at least
       basic support for "6 in 5" modules like v6.pm;

       Currently, PPI only supports starting a Perl 6 block. It does not
       currently support changing back to Perl 5 again. Additionally all POD
       and __DATA__ blocks and __END__ blocks will be included in the Perl 6
       string and will not be parsed by PPI.

   perl6
       The "perl6" method returns the block of Perl 6 code that is attached to
       the "use v6...;" command.
