NAME
     ptmd -- platform thermal monitor daemon.

SYNOPSIS
     ptmd

DESCRIPTION
     The ptmd daemon is automatically launched via its LaunchDaemon configura-
     tion file. On platforms that require its services ptmd stays running. On
     other platforms ptmd starts and then exits. While running ptmd relays to
     hardware any OS notifications effecting thermal conditions.
