Pod::Simple::DumpAsXML(Perl Programmers Reference GPod::Simple::DumpAsXML(3pm)



NAME
       Pod::Simple::DumpAsXML -- turn Pod into XML

SYNOPSIS
	 perl -MPod::Simple::DumpAsXML -e \
	  "exit Pod::Simple::DumpAsXML->filter(shift)->any_errata_seen" \
	  thingy.pod

DESCRIPTION
       Pod::Simple::DumpAsXML is a subclass of Pod::Simple that parses Pod and
       turns it into indented and wrapped XML.	This class is of interest to
       people writing Pod formatters based on Pod::Simple.

       Pod::Simple::DumpAsXML inherits methods from Pod::Simple.

SEE ALSO
       Pod::Simple::XMLOutStream is rather like this class.
       Pod::Simple::XMLOutStream's output is space-padded in a way that's
       better for sending to an XML processor (that is, it has no ignoreable
       whitespace). But Pod::Simple::DumpAsXML's output is much more human-
       readable, being (more-or-less) one token per line, with line-wrapping.

       Pod::Simple::DumpAsText is rather like this class, except that it
       doesn't dump with XML syntax.  Try them and see which one you like
       best!
