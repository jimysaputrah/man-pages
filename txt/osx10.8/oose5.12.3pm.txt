NAME
       oose - syntactic sugar to make Moose one-liners easier

VERSION
       version 2.0205

SYNOPSIS
	 # create a Moose class on the fly ...
	 perl -Moose=Foo -e 'has bar => ( is=>q[ro], default => q[baz] ); print Foo->new->bar' # prints baz

	 # loads an existing class (Moose or non-Moose)
	 # and re-"opens" the package definition to make
	 # debugging/introspection easier
	 perl -Moose=+My::Class -e 'print join ", " => __PACKAGE__->meta->get_method_list'

	 # also loads Moose::Util::TypeConstraints to allow subtypes etc
	 perl -Moose=Person -e'subtype q[ValidAge] => as q[Int] => where { $_ > 0 && $_ < 78 }; has => age ( isa => q[ValidAge], is => q[ro]); Person->new(age => 90)'

DESCRIPTION
       oose.pm is a simple source filter that adds "package $name; use Moose;
       use Moose::Util::TypeConstraints;" to the beginning of your script and
       was entirely created because typing "perl -e'package Foo; use Moose;
       ...'" was annoying me.

INTERFACE
       oose provides exactly one method and it's automatically called by perl:

       import($package)
	   Pass a package name to import to be used by the source filter. The
	   package defaults to "Class" if none is given.

DEPENDENCIES
       You will need Filter::Simple and eventually Moose

INCOMPATIBILITIES
       None reported. But it is a source filter and might have issues there.

BUGS
       See "BUGS" in Moose for details on reporting bugs.
