MooseX::Types::UndefinUserpContributed Perl DocMooseX::Types::UndefinedType(3)



DESCRIPTION
       Whenever a type handle function (e.g. "Int()" can't find a type
       constraint under it's full name, it assumes it has not yet been
       defined.  It will then return an instance of this class, handling only
       stringification, name and possible identification of undefined types.

       Later, when you try to use the Undefined Type Constraint,
       autovivification will be attempted.

METHODS
   new
       Takes a full type name as argument and returns an instance of this
       class.

   name
       Returns the stored type name.

   __autovivify
       Try to see if the type constraint has yet been defined and if so create
       it.

   can_be_inlined
       Make sure that if a type hasn't been defined yet when Moose wants to
       inline it, we don't allow inlining.

   AUTOLOAD
       Try to autovivify and delegate

   DESTROY
       Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint::Parameterizable complains if this isn't
       here. TODO to find out why.
