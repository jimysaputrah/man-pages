SSL_get_verify_result(3)	    OpenSSL	      SSL_get_verify_result(3)



NAME
       SSL_get_verify_result - get result of peer certificate verification

SYNOPSIS
	#include <openssl/ssl.h>

	long SSL_get_verify_result(const SSL *ssl);

DESCRIPTION
       SSL_get_verify_result() returns the result of the verification of the
       X509 certificate presented by the peer, if any.

NOTES
       SSL_get_verify_result() can only return one error code while the
       verification of a certificate can fail because of many reasons at the
       same time. Only the last verification error that occurred during the
       processing is available from SSL_get_verify_result().

       The verification result is part of the established session and is
       restored when a session is reused.

BUGS
       If no peer certificate was presented, the returned result code is
       X509_V_OK. This is because no verification error occurred, it does
       however not indicate success. SSL_get_verify_result() is only useful in
       connection with SSL_get_peer_certificate(3).

RETURN VALUES
       The following return values can currently occur:

       X509_V_OK
	   The verification succeeded or no peer certificate was presented.

       Any other value
	   Documented in verify(1).
