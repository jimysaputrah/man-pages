DESCRIPTION
       These  procedures  may  be used to map and unmap windows managed by Tk.
       Tk_MapWindow maps the window given by tkwin, and also creates an X win-
       dow  corresponding  to  tkwin  if  it  does not already exist.  See the
       Tk_CreateWindow manual entry for information on	deferred  window  cre-
       ation.  Tk_UnmapWindow unmaps tkwin's window from the screen.

       If  tkwin  is a child window (i.e. Tk_CreateWindow was used to create a
       child window), then event handlers interested in map and  unmap	events
       are  invoked immediately.  If tkwin is not an internal window, then the
       event handlers will be invoked later, after X has seen the request  and
       returned an event for it.

       These procedures should be used in place of the X procedures XMapWindow
       and XUnmapWindow, since they  update  Tk's  local  data	structure  for
       tkwin.	Applications using Tk should not invoke XMapWindow and XUnmap-
       Window directly.
