NAME
       XML::Parser::Style::Objects

SYNOPSIS
	 use XML::Parser;
	 my $p = XML::Parser->new(Style => 'Objects', Pkg => 'MyNode');
	 my $tree = $p->parsefile('foo.xml');

DESCRIPTION
       This module implements XML::Parser's Objects style parser.

       This is similar to the Tree style, except that a hash object is created
       for each element. The corresponding object will be in the class whose
       name is created by appending "::" and the element name to the package
       set with the Pkg option. Non-markup text will be in the ::Characters
       class. The contents of the corresponding object will be in an anonymous
       array that is the value of the Kids property for that object.
