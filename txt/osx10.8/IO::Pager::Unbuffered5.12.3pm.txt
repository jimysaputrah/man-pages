NAME
       IO::Pager::Unbuffered - Pipe output to a pager if output is to a TTY

SYNOPSIS
	 use IO::Pager::Unbuffered;
	 {
	   #local $STDOUT =	IO::Pager::Unbuffered::open *STDOUT;
	   local  $STDOUT = new IO::Pager::Unbuffered	    *STDOUT;
	   print <<"  HEREDOC" ;
	   ...
	   A bunch of text later
	   HEREDOC
	 }

DESCRIPTION
       IO::Pager is designed to programmaticly decide whether or not to point
       the STDOUT file handle into a pipe to program specified in $ENV{PAGER}
       or one of a standard list of pagers.

   new( [FILEHANDLE] )
       Instantiate a new IO::Pager to paginate FILEHANDLE if necessary.
       Assign the return value to a scoped variable.

       FILEHANDLE
	   Defaults to currently select()-ed FILEHANDLE.

   open( [FILEHANDLE] )
       An alias for new.

   close( FILEHANDLE )
       Explicitly close the filehandle, if a pager was deemed necessary this
       will kill it. Normally you'd just wait for the user to exit the pager
       and the object to pass out of scope.

       This does not default to the current filehandle.

CAVEATS
       You probably want to do something with SIGPIPE eg;

	 eval{
	   $SIG{PIPE} = sub{ die };
	   local $STDOUT = IO::Pager::open(*STDOUT);

	   while(1){
	     #Do something
	   }
	 }

	 #Do something else
