NAME
       glColorMask  -  enable and disable writing of frame buffer color compo-
       nents


C SPECIFICATION
       void glColorMask( GLboolean red,
			 GLboolean green,
			 GLboolean blue,
			 GLboolean alpha )


PARAMETERS
       red, green, blue, alpha
			     Specify whether red, green, blue, and  alpha  can
			     or  cannot be written into the frame buffer.  The
			     initial values are all GL_TRUE,  indicating  that
			     the color components can be written.

DESCRIPTION
       glColorMask  specifies  whether	the individual color components in the
       frame buffer can or cannot be written.  If red is GL_FALSE,  for  exam-
       ple,  no change is made to the red component of any pixel in any of the
       color buffers, regardless of the drawing operation attempted.

       Changes to individual bits of components cannot be controlled.  Rather,
       changes are either enabled or disabled for entire color components.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_OPERATION  is  generated  if glColorMask is executed between
       the execution of glBegin and the corresponding execution of glEnd.

ASSOCIATED GETS
       glGet with argument GL_COLOR_WRITEMASK
       glGet with argument GL_RGBA_MODE
