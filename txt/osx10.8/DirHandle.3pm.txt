NAME
       DirHandle - supply object methods for directory handles

SYNOPSIS
	   use DirHandle;
	   $d = DirHandle->new(".");
	   if (defined $d) {
	       while (defined($_ = $d->read)) { something($_); }
	       $d->rewind;
	       while (defined($_ = $d->read)) { something_else($_); }
	       undef $d;
	   }

DESCRIPTION
       The "DirHandle" method provide an alternative interface to the
       opendir(), closedir(), readdir(), and rewinddir() functions.

       The only objective benefit to using "DirHandle" is that it avoids
       namespace pollution by creating globs to hold directory handles.

NOTES
       o   On Mac OS (Classic), the path separator is ':', not '/', and the
	   current directory is denoted as ':', not '.'. You should be careful
	   about specifying relative pathnames. While a full path always
	   begins with a volume name, a relative pathname should always begin
	   with a ':'.	If specifying a volume name only, a trailing ':' is
	   required.
