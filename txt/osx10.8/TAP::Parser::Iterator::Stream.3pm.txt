NAME
       TAP::Parser::Iterator::Stream - Internal TAP::Parser Iterator

VERSION
       Version 3.17

SYNOPSIS
	 # see TAP::Parser::IteratorFactory for preferred usage

	 # to use directly:
	 use TAP::Parser::Iterator::Stream;
	 open( TEST, 'test.tap' );
	 my $it   = TAP::Parser::Iterator::Stream->new(\*TEST);
	 my $line = $it->next;

DESCRIPTION
       This is a simple iterator wrapper for reading from filehandles, used by
       TAP::Parser.  Unless you're subclassing, you probably won't need to use
       this module directly.

METHODS
   Class Methods
       "new"

       Create an iterator.  Expects one argument containing a filehandle.

   Instance Methods
       "next"

       Iterate through it, of course.

       "next_raw"

       Iterate raw input without applying any fixes for quirky input syntax.

       "wait"

       Get the wait status for this iterator. Always returns zero.

       "exit"

       Get the exit status for this iterator. Always returns zero.
