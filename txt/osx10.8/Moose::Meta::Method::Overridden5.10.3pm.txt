Moose::Meta::Method::OUseriContributed Perl Moose::Meta::Method::Overridden(3)



NAME
       Moose::Meta::Method::Overridden - A Moose Method metaclass for
       overridden methods

DESCRIPTION
       This class implements method overriding logic for the Moose "override"
       keyword.

       The overriding subroutine's parent will be invoked explicitly using the
       "super" keyword from the parent class's method definition.

METHODS
       Moose::Meta::Method::Overridden->new(%options)
	   This constructs a new object. It accepts the following options:

	   o	   class

		   The metaclass object for the class in which the override is
		   being declared. This option is required.

	   o	   name

		   The name of the method which we are overriding. This method
		   must exist in one of the class's superclasses. This option
		   is required.

	   o	   method

		   The subroutine reference which implements the overriding.
		   This option is required.
