NAME
       MooseX::Storage::Engine::Trait::OnlyWhenBuilt - An engine trait to
       bypass serialization

SYNOPSIS
	   {   package Point;
	       use Moose;
	       use MooseX::Storage;

	       with Storage( traits => [qw|OnlyWhenBuilt|] );

	       has 'x' => (is => 'rw', lazy_build => 1 );
	       has 'y' => (is => 'rw', lazy_build => 1 );
	       has 'z' => (is => 'rw', builder => '_build_z' );

	       sub _build_x { 3 }
	       sub _build_y { expensive_computation() }
	       sub _build_z { 3 }
	   }

	   my $p = Point->new( 'x' => 4 );

	   # the result of ->pack will contain:
	   # { x => 4, z => 3 }
	   $p->pack;

DESCRIPTION
       Sometimes you don't want a particular attribute to be part of the
       serialization if it has not been built yet. If you invoke "Storage()"
       as outlined in the "Synopsis", only attributes that have been built
       (ie, where the predicate returns 'true') will be serialized.  This
       avoids any potentially expensive computations.

       This trait is applied to an instance of MooseX::Storage::Engine, for
       the user-visible version shown in the SYNOPSIS, see
       MooseX::Storage::Traits::OnlyWhenBuilt

METHODS
   Introspection
       meta
