PHP-FPM(8)		      Scripting Language		    PHP-FPM(8)



NAME
       php-fpm - PHP FastCGI Process Manager 'PHP-FPM'

SYNOPSIS
       php-fpm [options]


DESCRIPTION
       PHP  is	a widely-used general-purpose scripting language that is espe-
       cially suited for Web development and can be embedded into  HTML.  This
       is  a  variant of PHP that will run in the background as a daemon, lis-
       tening for CGI requests. Output is logged to  /usr/var/log/php-fpm.log.

       Most  options are set in the configuration file. The configuration file
       is /private/etc/php-fpm.conf. By default, php-fpm will respond  to  CGI
       requests  listening  on	localhost  http  port  9000. Therefore php-fpm
       expects your webserver to forward all requests for '.php' files to port
       9000  and  you  should edit your webserver configuration file appropri-
       ately.

FILES
       php-fpm.conf   The configuration file for the php-fpm daemon.

       php.ini	      The standard php configuration file.

EXAMPLES
       You should use the init script provided to start and stop  the  php-fpm
       daemon.	This  situation  applies for any unix systems which use init.d
       for their main process manager.

	      sudo /etc/init.d/php-fpm start

       If your installation has no appropriate	init  script,  launch  php-fpm
       with  no  arguments. It will launch as a daemon (background process) by
       default. The file /usr/var/run/php-fpm.pid determines  whether  php-fpm
       is  already up and running. Once started, php-fpm then responds to sev-
       eral POSIX signals:

	      SIGINT,SIGTERM	  immediate termination
	      SIGQUIT		  graceful stop
	      SIGUSR1		  re-open log file
	      SIGUSR2		  graceful reload of all workers +  reload  of
	      fpm conf/binary


TIPS
       The PHP-FPM CGI daemon will work well  with  most  popular  webservers,
       including Apache2, lighttpd and nginx.
