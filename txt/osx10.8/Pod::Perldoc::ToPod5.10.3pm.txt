NAME
       Pod::Perldoc::ToPod - let Perldoc render Pod as ... Pod!

SYNOPSIS
	 perldoc -opod Some::Modulename

       (That's currently the same as the following:)

	 perldoc -u Some::Modulename

DESCRIPTION
       This is a "plug-in" class that allows Perldoc to display Pod source as
       itself!	Pretty Zen, huh?

       Currently this class works by just filtering out the non-Pod stuff from
       a given input file.
