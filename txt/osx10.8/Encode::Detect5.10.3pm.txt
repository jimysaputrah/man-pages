NAME
       Encode::Detect - An Encode::Encoding subclass that detects the encoding
       of data

SYNOPSIS
	 use Encode;
	 require Encode::Detect;
	 my $utf8 = decode("Detect", $data);

DESCRIPTION
       This Perl module is an Encode::Encoding subclass that uses
       Encode::Detect::Detector to determine the charset of the input data and
       then decodes it using the encoder of the detected charset.

       It is similar to Encode::Guess, but does not require the configuration
       of a set of expected encodings.	Like Encode::Guess, it only supports
       decoding--it cannot encode.
