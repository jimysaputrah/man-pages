AU_FREE_TOKEN(3)	 BSD Library Functions Manual	      AU_FREE_TOKEN(3)

NAME
     au_free_token -- deallocate a token_t created by any of the au_to_*() BSM
     API functions

LIBRARY
     Basic Security Module Library (libbsm, -lbsm)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <bsm/libbsm.h>

     void
     au_free_token(token_t *tok);

DESCRIPTION
     The BSM API generally manages deallocation of token_t objects.  However,
     if au_write(3) is passed a bad audit descriptor, the token_t * parameter
     will be left untouched.  In that case, the caller can deallocate the
     token_t using au_free_token() if desired.

     The tok argument is a token_t * generated by one of the au_to_*() BSM API
     calls.  For convenience, tok may be NULL, in which case au_free_token()
     returns immediately.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
     This is, in fact, what audit_write(3) does, in keeping with the existing
     memory management model of the BSM API.

HISTORY
     The OpenBSM implementation was created by McAfee Research, the security
     division of McAfee Inc., under contract to Apple Computer, Inc., in 2004.
     It was subsequently adopted by the TrustedBSD Project as the foundation
     for the OpenBSM distribution.

AUTHORS
     This software was created by Robert Watson, Wayne Salamon, and Suresh
     Krishnaswamy for McAfee Research, the security research division of
     McAfee, Inc., under contract to Apple Computer, Inc.

     The Basic Security Module (BSM) interface to audit records and audit
     event stream format were defined by Sun Microsystems.
