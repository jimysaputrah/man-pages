NAME
       glClearIndex - specify the clear value for the color index buffers


C SPECIFICATION
       void glClearIndex( GLfloat c )


PARAMETERS
       c  Specifies  the  index used when the color index buffers are cleared.
	  The initial value is 0.

DESCRIPTION
       glClearIndex specifies the index used by glClear  to  clear  the  color
       index  buffers.	 c is not clamped.  Rather, c is converted to a fixed-
       point value with unspecified precision  to  the	right  of  the	binary
       point.  The integer part of this value is then masked with 2^m, where m
       is the number of bits in a color index stored in the frame buffer.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if glClearIndex is  executed  between
       the execution of glBegin and the corresponding execution of glEnd.

ASSOCIATED GETS
       glGet with argument GL_INDEX_CLEAR_VALUE
       glGet with argument GL_INDEX_BITS
