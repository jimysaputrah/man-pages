NAME
       glGenVertexArrays - generate vertex array object names

C SPECIFICATION
       void glGenVertexArrays(GLsizei n, GLuint *arrays);

PARAMETERS
       n
	   Specifies the number of vertex array object names to generate.

       arrays
	   Specifies an array in which the generated vertex array object names
	   are stored.

DESCRIPTION
       glGenVertexArrays returns n vertex array object names in arrays. There
       is no guarantee that the names form a contiguous set of integers;
       however, it is guaranteed that none of the returned names was in use
       immediately before the call to glGenVertexArrays.

       Vertex array object names returned by a call to glGenVertexArrays are
       not returned by subsequent calls, unless they are first deleted with
       glDeleteVertexArrays().

       The names returned in arrays are marked as used, for the purposes of
       glGenVertexArrays only, but they acquire state and type only when they
       are first bound.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if n is negative.
