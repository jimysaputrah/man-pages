NAME
       MooseX::Types::Util - Common utility functions for the distribution

VERSION
       version 0.30

DESCRIPTION
       This package the exportable functions that many parts in MooseX::Types
       might need.

FUNCTIONS
   filter_tags
       Takes a list and returns two references. The first is a hash reference
       containing the tags as keys and the number of their appearance as
       values.	The second is an array reference containing all other
       elements.

   has_available_type_export
	 TypeConstraint | Undef = has_available_type_export($package, $name);

       This function allows you to introspect if a given type export is
       available at this point in time. This means that the $package must have
       imported a typeconstraint with the name $name, and it must be still in
       its symbol table.

       Two arguments are expected:

       $package
	   The name of the package to introspect.

       $name
	   The name of the type export to introspect.

       Note that the $name is the exported name of the type, not the declared
       one. This means that if you use Sub::Exporters functionality to rename
       an import like this:

	 use MyTypes Str => { -as => 'MyStr' };

       you would have to introspect this type like this:

	 has_available_type_export $package, 'MyStr';

       The return value will be either the type constraint that belongs to the
       export or an undefined value.
