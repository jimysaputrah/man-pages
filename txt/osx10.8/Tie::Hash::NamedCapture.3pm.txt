NAME
       Tie::Hash::NamedCapture - Named regexp capture buffers

SYNOPSIS
	   tie my %hash, "Tie::Hash::NamedCapture";
	   # %hash now behaves like %+

	   tie my %hash, "Tie::Hash::NamedCapture", all => 1;
	   # %hash now access buffers from regexp in $qr like %-

DESCRIPTION
       This module is used to implement the special hashes "%+" and "%-", but
       it can be used to tie other variables as you choose.

       When the "all" parameter is provided, then the tied hash elements will
       be array refs listing the contents of each capture buffer whose name is
       the same as the associated hash key. If none of these buffers were
       involved in the match, the contents of that array ref will be as many
       "undef" values as there are capture buffers with that name. In other
       words, the tied hash will behave as "%-".

       When the "all" parameter is omitted or false, then the tied hash
       elements will be the contents of the leftmost defined buffer with the
       name of the associated hash key. In other words, the tied hash will
       behave as "%+".

       The keys of "%-"-like hashes correspond to all buffer names found in
       the regular expression; the keys of "%+"-like hashes list only the
       names of buffers that have captured (and that are thus associated to
       defined values).
