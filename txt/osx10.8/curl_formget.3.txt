NAME
       curl_formget  -	serialize  a  previously built multipart/formdata HTTP
       POST chain

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curl/curl.h>

       void curl_formget(struct curl_httppost * form, void *userp,
			 curl_formget_callback append );

DESCRIPTION
       curl_formget() is used to serialize data previously built/appended with
       curl_formadd(3).  Accepts a void pointer as second argument named userp
       which will be passed as the first argument to the curl_formget_callback
       function.

       typedef	size_t (*curl_formget_callback)(void *userp, const char *buf,
       size_t len);

       The curl_formget_callback will be executed for each part  of  the  HTTP
       POST  chain.  The  character  buffer passed to the callback must not be
       freed. The callback should return the buffer length  passed  to	it  on
       success.

       If  the CURLFORM_STREAM option is used in the formpost, it will prevent
       curl_formget(3) from working until you've  performed  the  actual  HTTP
       request	as only then will libcurl get the actual read callback to use!

RETURN VALUE
       0 means everything was ok, non-zero means an error occurred

EXAMPLE
	size_t print_httppost_callback(void *arg, const char *buf, size_t len)
	{
	  fwrite(buf, len, 1, stdout);
	  (*(size_t *) arg) += len;
	  return len;
	}

	size_t print_httppost(struct curl_httppost *post)
	{
	  size_t total_size = 0;
	  if(curl_formget(post, &total_size, print_httppost_callback)) {
	    return (size_t) -1;
	  }
	  return total_size;
	}
