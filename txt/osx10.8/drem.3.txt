NAME
     remainder -- floating-point remainder function

SYNOPSIS
     #include <math.h>

     double
     remainder(double x, double y);

     long double
     remainderl(long double x, long double y);

     float
     remainderf(float x, float y);

DESCRIPTION
     The remainder() functions compute the value r such that r = x - n*y,
     where n is the integer nearest the exact value of x/y.

     If there are two integers closest to x/y, n shall be the even one. If r
     is zero, it is given the same sign as x.

SPECIAL VALUES
     remainder(x, y) returns a NaN and raises the "invalid" floating-point
     exception if x is infinite or y is 0.

NOTE
     The drem() function is deprecated.  Please use the C99 function
     remainder() instead.

STANDARDS
     The remainder() functions conform to ISO/IEC 9899:1999(E).
