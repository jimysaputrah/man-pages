NAME
       glFrontFace - define front- and back-facing polygons


C SPECIFICATION
       void glFrontFace( GLenum mode )


PARAMETERS
       mode  Specifies	the  orientation  of front-facing polygons.  GL_CW and
	     GL_CCW are accepted.  The initial value is GL_CCW.

DESCRIPTION
       In a scene composed entirely of	opaque	closed	surfaces,  back-facing
       polygons  are  never visible.  Eliminating these invisible polygons has
       the obvious benefit of speeding up the  rendering  of  the  image.   To
       enable  and  disable elimination of back-facing polygons, call glEnable
       and glDisable with argument GL_CULL_FACE.

       The projection of a polygon to  window  coordinates  is	said  to  have
       clockwise  winding  if  an imaginary object following the path from its
       first vertex, its second vertex, and so on, to  its  last  vertex,  and
       finally	back to its first vertex, moves in a clockwise direction about
       the interior of the polygon.  The polygon's winding is said to be coun-
       terclockwise if the imaginary object following the same path moves in a
       counterclockwise  direction  about  the	interior   of	the   polygon.
       glFrontFace specifies whether polygons with clockwise winding in window
       coordinates, or counterclockwise winding  in  window  coordinates,  are
       taken to be front-facing.  Passing GL_CCW to mode selects counterclock-
       wise polygons as front-facing;  GL_CW  selects  clockwise  polygons  as
       front-facing.   By  default,  counterclockwise polygons are taken to be
       front-facing.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if mode is not an accepted value.

       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if glFrontFace  is  executed  between
       the execution of glBegin and the corresponding execution of glEnd.
