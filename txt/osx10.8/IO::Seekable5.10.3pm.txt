NAME
       IO::Seekable - supply seek based methods for I/O objects

SYNOPSIS
	   use IO::Seekable;
	   package IO::Something;
	   @ISA = qw(IO::Seekable);

DESCRIPTION
       "IO::Seekable" does not have a constructor of its own as it is intended
       to be inherited by other "IO::Handle" based objects. It provides
       methods which allow seeking of the file descriptors.

       $io->getpos
	   Returns an opaque value that represents the current position of the
	   IO::File, or "undef" if this is not possible (eg an unseekable
	   stream such as a terminal, pipe or socket). If the fgetpos()
	   function is available in your C library it is used to implements
	   getpos, else perl emulates getpos using C's ftell() function.

       $io->setpos
	   Uses the value of a previous getpos call to return to a previously
	   visited position. Returns "0 but true" on success, "undef" on
	   failure.

       See perlfunc for complete descriptions of each of the following
       supported "IO::Seekable" methods, which are just front ends for the
       corresponding built-in functions:

       $io->seek ( POS, WHENCE )
	   Seek the IO::File to position POS, relative to WHENCE:

	   WHENCE=0 (SEEK_SET)
		   POS is absolute position. (Seek relative to the start of
		   the file)

	   WHENCE=1 (SEEK_CUR)
		   POS is an offset from the current position. (Seek relative
		   to current)

	   WHENCE=2 (SEEK_END)
		   POS is an offset from the end of the file. (Seek relative
		   to end)

	   The SEEK_* constants can be imported from the "Fcntl" module if you
	   don't wish to use the numbers 0 1 or 2 in your code.

	   Returns 1 upon success, 0 otherwise.

       $io->sysseek( POS, WHENCE )
	   Similar to $io->seek, but sets the IO::File's position using the
	   system call lseek(2) directly, so will confuse most perl IO
	   operators except sysread and syswrite (see perlfunc for full
	   details)

	   Returns the new position, or "undef" on failure.  A position of
	   zero is returned as the string "0 but true"

       $io->tell
	   Returns the IO::File's current position, or -1 on error.
