SPI_EXECUTE_WITH_ARGS(3)PostgreSQL 9.1.4 DocumentationSPI_EXECUTE_WITH_ARGS(3)



NAME
       SPI_execute_with_args - execute a command with out-of-line parameters

SYNOPSIS
       int SPI_execute_with_args(const char *command,
				 int nargs, Oid *argtypes,
				 Datum *values, const char *nulls,
				 bool read_only, long count)

DESCRIPTION
       SPI_execute_with_args executes a command that might include references
       to externally supplied parameters. The command text refers to a
       parameter as $n, and the call specifies data types and values for each
       such symbol.  read_only and count have the same interpretation as in
       SPI_execute.

       The main advantage of this routine compared to SPI_execute is that data
       values can be inserted into the command without tedious
       quoting/escaping, and thus with much less risk of SQL-injection
       attacks.

       Similar results can be achieved with SPI_prepare followed by
       SPI_execute_plan; however, when using this function the query plan is
       customized to the specific parameter values provided. For one-time
       query execution, this function should be preferred. If the same command
       is to be executed with many different parameters, either method might
       be faster, depending on the cost of re-planning versus the benefit of
       custom plans.

ARGUMENTS
       const char * command
	   command string

       int nargs
	   number of input parameters ($1, $2, etc.)

       Oid * argtypes
	   an array containing the OIDs of the data types of the parameters

       Datum * values
	   an array of actual parameter values

       const char * nulls
	   an array describing which parameters are null

	   If nulls is NULL then SPI_execute_with_args assumes that no
	   parameters are null.

       bool read_only
	   true for read-only execution

       long count
	   maximum number of rows to process or return

RETURN VALUE
       The return value is the same as for SPI_execute.


       SPI_processed and SPI_tuptable are set as in SPI_execute if successful.
