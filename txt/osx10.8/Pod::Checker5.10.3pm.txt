Pod::Checker(3pm)      Perl Programmers Reference Guide      Pod::Checker(3pm)



NAME
       Pod::Checker, podchecker() - check pod documents for syntax errors

SYNOPSIS
	 use Pod::Checker;

	 $syntax_okay = podchecker($filepath, $outputpath, %options);

	 my $checker = new Pod::Checker %options;
	 $checker->parse_from_file($filepath, \*STDERR);

OPTIONS/ARGUMENTS
       $filepath is the input POD to read and $outputpath is where to write
       POD syntax error messages. Either argument may be a scalar indicating a
       file-path, or else a reference to an open filehandle.  If unspecified,
       the input-file it defaults to "\*STDIN", and the output-file defaults
       to "\*STDERR".

   podchecker()
       This function can take a hash of options:

       -warnings => val
	   Turn warnings on/off. val is usually 1 for on, but higher values
	   trigger additional warnings. See "Warnings".

DESCRIPTION
       podchecker will perform syntax checking of Perl5 POD format
       documentation.

       Curious/ambitious users are welcome to propose additional features they
       wish to see in Pod::Checker and podchecker and verify that the checks
       are consistent with perlpod.

       The following checks are currently performed:

       o   Unknown '=xxxx' commands, unknown 'X<...>' interior-sequences, and
	   unterminated interior sequences.

       o   Check for proper balancing of "=begin" and "=end". The contents of
	   such a block are generally ignored, i.e. no syntax checks are
	   performed.

       o   Check for proper nesting and balancing of "=over", "=item" and
	   "=back".

       o   Check for same nested interior-sequences (e.g.  "L<...L<...>...>").

       o   Check for malformed or non-existing entities "E<...>".

       o   Check for correct syntax of hyperlinks "L<...>". See perlpod for
	   details.

       o   Check for unresolved document-internal links. This check may also
	   reveal misspelled links that seem to be internal links but should
	   be links to something else.

DIAGNOSTICS
   Errors
       o   empty =headn

	   A heading ("=head1" or "=head2") without any text? That ain't no
	   heading!

       o   =over on line N without closing =back

	   The "=over" command does not have a corresponding "=back" before
	   the next heading ("=head1" or "=head2") or the end of the file.

       o   =item without previous =over

       o   =back without previous =over

	   An "=item" or "=back" command has been found outside a
	   "=over"/"=back" block.

       o   No argument for =begin

	   A "=begin" command was found that is not followed by the formatter
	   specification.

       o   =end without =begin

	   A standalone "=end" command was found.

       o   Nested =begin's

	   There were at least two consecutive "=begin" commands without the
	   corresponding "=end". Only one "=begin" may be active at a time.

       o   =for without formatter specification

	   There is no specification of the formatter after the "=for"
	   command.

       o   unresolved internal link NAME

	   The given link to NAME does not have a matching node in the current
	   POD. This also happened when a single word node name is not
	   enclosed in "".

       o   Unknown command "CMD"

	   An invalid POD command has been found. Valid are "=head1",
	   "=head2", "=head3", "=head4", "=over", "=item", "=back", "=begin",
	   "=end", "=for", "=pod", "=cut"

       o   Unknown interior-sequence "SEQ"

	   An invalid markup command has been encountered. Valid are: "B<>",
	   "C<>", "E<>", "F<>", "I<>", "L<>", "S<>", "X<>", "Z<>"

       o   nested commands CMD<...CMD<...>...>

	   Two nested identical markup commands have been found. Generally
	   this does not make sense.

       o   garbled entity STRING

	   The STRING found cannot be interpreted as a character entity.

       o   Entity number out of range

	   An entity specified by number (dec, hex, oct) is out of range
	   (1-255).

       o   malformed link L<>

	   The link found cannot be parsed because it does not conform to the
	   syntax described in perlpod.

       o   nonempty Z<>

	   The "Z<>" sequence is supposed to be empty.

       o   empty X<>

	   The index entry specified contains nothing but whitespace.

       o   Spurious text after =pod / =cut

	   The commands "=pod" and "=cut" do not take any arguments.

       o   Spurious character(s) after =back

	   The "=back" command does not take any arguments.

   Warnings
       These may not necessarily cause trouble, but indicate mediocre style.

       o   multiple occurrence of link target name

	   The POD file has some "=item" and/or "=head" commands that have the
	   same text. Potential hyperlinks to such a text cannot be unique
	   then.  This warning is printed only with warning level greater than
	   one.

       o   line containing nothing but whitespace in paragraph

	   There is some whitespace on a seemingly empty line. POD is very
	   sensitive to such things, so this is flagged. vi users switch on
	   the list option to avoid this problem.

       o   previous =item has no contents

	   There is a list "=item" right above the flagged line that has no
	   text contents. You probably want to delete empty items.

       o   preceding non-item paragraph(s)

	   A list introduced by "=over" starts with a text or verbatim
	   paragraph, but continues with "=item"s. Move the non-item paragraph
	   out of the "=over"/"=back" block.

       o   =item type mismatch (one vs. two)

	   A list started with e.g. a bullet-like "=item" and continued with a
	   numbered one. This is obviously inconsistent. For most translators
	   the type of the first "=item" determines the type of the list.

       o   N unescaped "<>" in paragraph

	   Angle brackets not written as "<lt>" and "<gt>" can potentially
	   cause errors as they could be misinterpreted as markup commands.
	   This is only printed when the -warnings level is greater than 1.

       o   Unknown entity

	   A character entity was found that does not belong to the standard
	   ISO set or the POD specials "verbar" and "sol".

       o   No items in =over

	   The list opened with "=over" does not contain any items.

       o   No argument for =item

	   "=item" without any parameters is deprecated. It should either be
	   followed by "*" to indicate an unordered list, by a number
	   (optionally followed by a dot) to indicate an ordered (numbered)
	   list or simple text for a definition list.

       o   empty section in previous paragraph

	   The previous section (introduced by a "=head" command) does not
	   contain any text. This usually indicates that something is missing.
	   Note: A "=head1" followed immediately by "=head2" does not trigger
	   this warning.

       o   Verbatim paragraph in NAME section

	   The NAME section ("=head1 NAME") should consist of a single
	   paragraph with the script/module name, followed by a dash `-' and a
	   very short description of what the thing is good for.

       o   =headn without preceding higher level

	   For example if there is a "=head2" in the POD file prior to a
	   "=head1".

   Hyperlinks
       There are some warnings with respect to malformed hyperlinks:

       o   ignoring leading/trailing whitespace in link

	   There is whitespace at the beginning or the end of the contents of
	   L<...>.

       o   (section) in '$page' deprecated

	   There is a section detected in the page name of L<...>, e.g.
	   "L<passwd(2)>". POD hyperlinks may point to POD documents only.
	   Please write "C<passwd(2)>" instead. Some formatters are able to
	   expand this to appropriate code. For links to (builtin) functions,
	   please say "L<perlfunc/mkdir>", without ().

       o   alternative text/node '%s' contains non-escaped | or /

	   The characters "|" and "/" are special in the L<...> context.
	   Although the hyperlink parser does its best to determine which "/"
	   is text and which is a delimiter in case of doubt, one ought to
	   escape these literal characters like this:

	     /	   E<sol>
	     |	   E<verbar>

RETURN VALUE
       podchecker returns the number of POD syntax errors found or -1 if there
       were no POD commands at all found in the file.

EXAMPLES
       See "SYNOPSIS"

INTERFACE
       While checking, this module collects document properties, e.g. the
       nodes for hyperlinks ("=headX", "=item") and index entries ("X<>").
       POD translators can use this feature to syntax-check and get the nodes
       in a first pass before actually starting to convert. This is expensive
       in terms of execution time, but allows for very robust conversions.

       Since PodParser-1.24 the Pod::Checker module uses only the poderror
       method to print errors and warnings. The summary output (e.g.  "Pod
       syntax OK") has been dropped from the module and has been included in
       podchecker (the script). This allows users of Pod::Checker to control
       completely the output behavior. Users of podchecker (the script) get
       the well-known behavior.

       "Pod::Checker->new( %options )"
	   Return a reference to a new Pod::Checker object that inherits from
	   Pod::Parser and is used for calling the required methods later. The
	   following options are recognized:

	   "-warnings => num"
	     Print warnings if "num" is true. The higher the value of "num",
	   the more warnings are printed. Currently there are only levels 1
	   and 2.

	   "-quiet => num"
	     If "num" is true, do not print any errors/warnings. This is
	   useful when Pod::Checker is used to munge POD code into plain text
	   from within POD formatters.

       "$checker->poderror( @args )"
       "$checker->poderror( {%opts}, @args )"
	   Internal method for printing errors and warnings. If no options are
	   given, simply prints "@_". The following options are recognized and
	   used to form the output:

	     -msg

	   A message to print prior to @args.

	     -line

	   The line number the error occurred in.

	     -file

	   The file (name) the error occurred in.

	     -severity

	   The error level, should be 'WARNING' or 'ERROR'.

       "$checker->num_errors()"
	   Set (if argument specified) and retrieve the number of errors
	   found.

       "$checker->num_warnings()"
	   Set (if argument specified) and retrieve the number of warnings
	   found.

       "$checker->name()"
	   Set (if argument specified) and retrieve the canonical name of POD
	   as found in the "=head1 NAME" section.

       "$checker->node()"
	   Add (if argument specified) and retrieve the nodes (as defined by
	   "=headX" and "=item") of the current POD. The nodes are returned in
	   the order of their occurrence. They consist of plain text, each
	   piece of whitespace is collapsed to a single blank.

       "$checker->idx()"
	   Add (if argument specified) and retrieve the index entries (as
	   defined by "X<>") of the current POD. They consist of plain text,
	   each piece of whitespace is collapsed to a single blank.

       "$checker->hyperlink()"
	   Add (if argument specified) and retrieve the hyperlinks (as defined
	   by "L<>") of the current POD. They consist of a 2-item array: line
	   number and "Pod::Hyperlink" object.
