NAME
       Locale::Maketext::Extract::Plugin::TT2 - Template Toolkit format parser

SYNOPSIS
	   $plugin = Locale::Maketext::Extract::Plugin::TT2->new(
	       $lexicon 	   # A Locale::Maketext::Extract object
	       @file_types	   # Optionally specify a list of recognised file types
	   )

	   $plugin->extract($filename,$filecontents);

DESCRIPTION
       Extracts strings to localise from Template Toolkit templates.

SHORT PLUGIN NAME
	   tt2

VALID FORMATS
       Valid formats are:

       [% |l(args) %]string[% END %]
       [% 'string' | l(args) %]
       [% l('string',args) %]
       [% c.l('string') %]
	   Also all the above combinations with "c." prepended should work
	   correctly. This is the default syntax when using TT templates with
	   Mojolicious.

       l and loc are interchangeable.

       | and FILTER are interchangeable.

KNOWN FILE TYPES
       .tt
       .tt2
       .html
       .tt.*
       .tt2.*

REQUIRES
       Template

NOTES
       o   BEWARE Using the "loc" form can give false positives if you use the
	   Perl parser plugin on TT files.  If you want to use the "loc" form,
	   then you should specify the file types that you want to the Perl
	   plugin to parse, or enable the default file types, eg:

	      xgetext.pl -P perl ....	     # default file types
	      xgettext.pl -P perl=pl,pm  ... # specified file types

       o   The string-to-be-localised must be a string, not a variable. We try
	   not to extract calls to your localise function which contain
	   variables eg:

	       l('string',arg)	# extracted
	       l(var,arg)	# not extracted

	   This doesn't work for block filters, so don't do that. Eg:

	       [%  FILTER l %]
		  string [% var %]	# BAD!
	       [% END %]

       o   Getting the right line number is difficult in TT. Often it'll be a
	   range of lines, or it may be thrown out by the use of PRE_CHOMP or
	   POST_CHOMP.	It will always be within a few lines of the correct
	   location.

       o   If you have PRE/POST_CHOMP enabled by default in your templates,
	   then you should extract the strings using the same values.  In
	   order to set them, you can use the following wrapper script:

	      #!/usr/bin/perl

	      use Locale::Maketext::Extract::Run qw(xgettext);
	      use Locale::Maketext::Extract::Plugin::TT2();

	      %Locale::Maketext::Extract::Plugin::TT2::PARSER_OPTIONS = (
		   PRE_CHOMP  => 1, # or 2
		   POST_CHOMP => 1, # or 2

		   # Also START/END_TAG, ANYCASE, INTERPOLATE, V1DOLLAR, EVAL_PERL
	      );

	      xgettext(@ARGV);

       which made this possible.
