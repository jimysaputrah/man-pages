NAME
       TAP::Parser::Scheduler::Spinner - A no-op job.

VERSION
       Version 3.17

SYNOPSIS
	   use TAP::Parser::Scheduler::Spinner;

DESCRIPTION
       A no-op job. Returned by "TAP::Parser::Scheduler" as an instruction to
       the harness to spin (keep executing tests) while the scheduler can't
       return a real job.

METHODS
   Class Methods
       "new"

	   my $job = TAP::Parser::Scheduler::Spinner->new;

       Returns a new "TAP::Parser::Scheduler::Spinner" object.

       "is_spinner"

       Returns true indicating that is a 'spinner' job. Spinners are returned
       when the scheduler still has pending jobs but can't (because of
       locking) return one right now.
