NAME
       snmetadump - Save and process a copy of the Xsan File System metadata

SYNOPSIS
       snmetadump  [ [-d [-c]] [-a [-m] [-j <journal_file> [-j <journal_file>]
       ...]] [-r] [-x] [-X] [-b] [-D <n>] [-f <dump file>] ] [ FsName ]


DESCRIPTION
       The snmetadump utility provides the ability to create  a  copy  of  the
       volume metadata for use in restoring a volume after a disaster. If some
       portion of the Xsan volume is lost, the volume metadata can be restored
       from a copy of the metadata dump file.

       In  a  managed  Xsan  environment the metadata is kept up to date using
       special restore journal files.  These  restore  journals  describe  the
       metadata  updates  that must be applied to a metadata dump to bring the
       dump up to date with the current volume metadata. In the case of a dis-
       aster  and  metadata  recovery  all managed files on the volume will be
       restored as long as they had been stored to tape. When  the  volume  is
       accessed  after	the  metadata  has  been restored all files are in the
       "tape-only" state, meaning that the file will contain the data  of  the
       last copy stored. On a managed volume the process of keeping a metadata
       dump up to date by applying restore journal files is performed  by  the
       daily backup processing.

       A  Xsan metadata dump has limited uses in a non-managed environment. On
       a non-managed volume the dump only matches the state  of  the  metadata
       until  the  file  system  manager  (FSM) process is started. After this
       point metadata and data will have changed and the dump file is  out  of
       date. However, saving a copy of the metadata is valuable during signif-
       icant volume or hardware configuration  changes,  and  during  software
       upgrades.  If  accidental  misconfiguration or data loss is encountered
       the metadata dump can be used to restore the state of the metadata.


NOTES
       When saving a copy of the metadata it is recommended that copies of the
       volume configuration files are saved too.

       It  is  always recommended that cvfsck(1) is run before a metadata dump
       is saved. This will ensure that there are no  metadata  inconsistencies
       copied to the metadata dump.

       WARNING:  Incorrect  usage  of  this  utility  can result in data loss.
       Always refer to the Xsan documentation before using this utility.



USAGE
       -a     Apply Metadata Changes -	required after a new dump  is  created
	      in  order  for  the  Storage Manager to read the dump file. This
	      option will also close the current restore journal, open	a  new
	      restore journal, then locate and apply the restore journals that
	      need to be applied to the metadata dump. The backup process will
	      invoke snmetadump with this option as part of the nightly backup
	      on a managed volume.


       -b     Display the build information for this binary


       -c     This option can only be run with the -d option.  Clean up  meta-
	      data dump, restore journal and temporary files associated with a
	      volume. When a new metadata dump is generated, previous  restore
	      journals	are  no longer needed or valid. When invoked with this
	      option, snmetadump will check the metadump directory  for  files
	      to clean up.  This option cannot be undone, so it is recommended
	      that all existing dump and restore journal files	be  backed  up
	      prior to execution.


       -d     Dump Metadata - Read in the volume metadata and save a copy to a
	      metadata dump file. This file can later be used to replace  lost
	      metadata in the case of system failure.


       -D     Turn on debugging flags (useful for support personnel only).


       -f     Specify the name of the dump file to create or process. If no -f
	      argument is given then the default dump file will be  used.  The
	      default	   is	  /Library/Logs/Xsan/database/metadumps/metad-
	      ump.<FsName>


       -j     Apply the specified restore journal to the metadata dump.  NOTE:
	      Normally,  this  option would be used only if there is a journal
	      that needs to be	applied  manually  just  prior	to  filesystem
	      restoration.   This  option is needed only if a journal needs to
	      be applied outside of normal -a processing. After  using	-j  to
	      apply  a	journal, snmetadump can no longer track which journals
	      have or need to be applied, so either the metadata dump must  be
	      used  to	restore  the  filesystem or a new metadump needs to be
	      created.


       -m     Perform special processing for managed volumes - When  preparing
	      a  metadata dump for a volume metadata restore, the -m flag must
	      be included with the -a flag. This flag tells snmetadump to for-
	      mat the files on the volume so that their data will be read from
	      the copy on tape.


       -r     Restore Metadata - Read metadata state from the  dump  file  and
	      rebuild  the  volume metadata.  All Xsan binaries and configura-
	      tion files must be restored before this step can be processed.


       -x     Examine a metadata dump - Verify the format of the metadata dump


       -X     Test  the  metadump  status to verify that the metadump is valid
	      and usable by snmetadump. In addition this check will  test  the
	      metadump	version to ensure that the metadump file is compatible
	      with this version of  snmetadump.  If  the  metadump  is	usable
	      snmetadump  will exit with a status of 0. If the metadump is not
	      usable snmetadump will exit with a status of 1.


MORE NOTES
       On a managed volume it is important to note that snmetadump is a single
       piece of a larger backup and restore procedure. Be sure to refer to the
       Xsan documentation before attempting to use this utility.

       Incorrect usage of this utility may result in data loss.

       The snmetadump utility depends  on  adequate  free  metadata  space  to
       recover	file system metadata. It is recommended that managed Xsan file
       system use exclusive metadata stripe groups to prevent data files  from
       taking up needed metadata space. In the case where the snmetadump util-
       ity determines that there is not enough metadata space to manage disas-
       ter  recovery  snmetadump  will	fail  and recommend that an additional
       metadata stripe group be added. See the cvupdatefs(1) man page for more
       details on adding stripe groups.


RETURN VALUES
	  0 - Success
	  1 - Failure - There was an error processing the metadata dump
	  2 - Dump Busy - The dump is being processed by another instance of
		snmetadump. Try again later. See MORE NOTES section.
