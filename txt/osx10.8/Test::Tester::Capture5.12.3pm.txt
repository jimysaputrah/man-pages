NAME
       Test::Tester::Capture - Help testing test modules built with
       Test::Builder

DESCRIPTION
       This is a subclass of Test::Builder that overrides many of the methods
       so that they don't output anything. It also keeps track of it's own set
       of test results so that you can use Test::Builder based modules to
       perform tests on other Test::Builder based modules.

AUTHOR
       Most of the code here was lifted straight from Test::Builder and then
       had chunks removed by Fergal Daly <fergal@esatclear.ie>.
