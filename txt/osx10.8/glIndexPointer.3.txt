NAME
       glIndexPointer - define an array of color indexes


C SPECIFICATION
       void glIndexPointer( GLenum type,
			    GLsizei stride,
			    const GLvoid *pointer )


PARAMETERS
       type	Specifies  the	data  type  of	each color index in the array.
		Symbolic   constants   GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE,   GL_SHORT,   GL_INT,
		GL_FLOAT,  and	GL_DOUBLE  are	accepted. The initial value is
		GL_FLOAT.

       stride	Specifies the byte offset between consecutive  color  indexes.
		If  stride  is	0  (the  initial value), the color indexes are
		understood to be tightly packed in  the  array.   The  initial
		value is 0.

       pointer	Specifies a pointer to the first index in the array.  The ini-
		tial value is 0.

DESCRIPTION
       glIndexPointer specifies the location and data  of an  array  of  color
       indexes	to  use  when rendering.  type specifies the data type of each
       color index and stride gives the byte stride from one  color  index  to
       the  next  allowing  vertices and attributes to be packed into a single
       array or stored in separate arrays.  (Single-array storage may be  more
       efficient on some implementations; see glInterleavedArrays.)

       type, stride, and pointer are saved as client-side state.

       The  color index array is initially disabled. To enable and disable the
       array, call glEnableClientState and glDisableClientState with the argu-
       ment  GL_INDEX_ARRAY.  If  enabled,  the color index array is used when
       glDrawArrays, glDrawElements or glArrayElement is called.

       Use glDrawArrays to construct a sequence of primitives (all of the same
       type)  from  prespecified  vertex  and  vertex  attribute  arrays.  Use
       glArrayElement to specify primitives by indexing  vertices  and	vertex
       attributes  and glDrawElements to construct a sequence of primitives by
       indexing vertices and vertex attributes.

NOTES
       glIndexPointer is available only if the GL version is 1.1 or greater.

       The color index array is initially disabled, and it isn't accessed when
       glArrayElement, glDrawElements, or glDrawArrays is called.

       Execution of glIndexPointer is not allowed between glBegin and the cor-
       responding glEnd, but an error may or may not be generated. If an error
       is not generated, the operation is undefined.

       glIndexPointer is typically implemented on the client side.

       Since  the color index array parameters are client-side state, they are
       not  saved  or  restored  by   glPushAttrib   and   glPopAttrib.    Use
       glPushClientAttrib and glPopClientAttrib instead.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if type is not an accepted value.

       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if stride is negative.

       glIsEnabled with argument GL_INDEX_ARRAY
       glGet with argument GL_INDEX_ARRAY_TYPE
       glGet with argument GL_INDEX_ARRAY_STRIDE
       glGetPointerv with argument GL_INDEX_ARRAY_POINTER
