NAME
       glActiveTextureARB - select active texture unit


C SPECIFICATION
       void glActiveTextureARB( GLenum texture )


PARAMETERS
       texture	Specifies  which  texture  unit  to make active. The number of
		texture units is implementation  dependent,  but  must	be  at
		least  two. texture must be one of GL_TEXTUREi_ARB, where 0 <=
		i <  GL_MAX_TEXTURE_UNITS_ARB,	which  is  an  implementation-
		dependent value.  The intial value is GL_TEXTURE0_ARB.

DESCRIPTION
       glActiveTextureARB  selects which texture unit subsequent texture state
       calls will affect.  The number of texture units an implementation  sup-
       ports is implementation dependent, but must be at least 2.

       Vertex  arrays  are client-side GL resources, which are selected by the
       glClientActiveTextureARB routine.

NOTES
       glActiveTextureARB is only supported if GL_ARB_multitexture is included
       in  the	string	returned  by glGetString when called with the argument
       GL_EXTENSIONS.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if texture is not one of GL_TEXTUREi_ARB,
       where 0 <=i < GL_MAX_TEXTURE_UNITS_ARB.
