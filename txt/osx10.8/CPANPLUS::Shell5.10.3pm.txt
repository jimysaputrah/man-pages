NAME
       CPANPLUS::Shell

SYNOPSIS
	   use CPANPLUS::Shell; 	    # load the shell indicated by your
					    # config -- defaults to
					    # CPANPLUS::Shell::Default

	   use CPANPLUS::Shell qw[Classic]  # load CPANPLUS::Shell::Classic;

	   my $ui      = CPANPLUS::Shell->new();

DESCRIPTION
       This module is the generic loading (and base class) for all "CPANPLUS"
       shells. Through this module you can load any installed "CPANPLUS"
       shell.

       Just about all the functionality is provided by the shell that you have
       loaded, and not by this class (which merely functions as a generic
       loading class), so please consult the documentation of your shell of
       choice.

BUG REPORTS
       Please report bugs or other issues to <bug-cpanplus@rt.cpan.org<gt>.
