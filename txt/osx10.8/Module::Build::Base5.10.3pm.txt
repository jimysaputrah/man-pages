NAME
       Module::Build::Base - Default methods for Module::Build

SYNOPSIS
	 Please see the Module::Build documentation.

DESCRIPTION
       The "Module::Build::Base" module defines the core functionality of
       "Module::Build".  Its methods may be overridden by any of the platform-
       dependent modules in the "Module::Build::Platform::" namespace, but the
       intention here is to make this base module as platform-neutral as
       possible.  Nicely enough, Perl has several core tools available in the
       "File::" namespace for doing this, so the task isn't very difficult.

       Please see the "Module::Build" documentation for more details.
