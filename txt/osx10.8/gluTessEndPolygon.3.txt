NAME
       gluTessEndPolygon - delimit a polygon description


C SPECIFICATION
       void gluTessEndPolygon( GLUtesselator* tess )


PARAMETERS
       tess  Specifies the tessellation object (created with gluNewTess).

DESCRIPTION
       gluTessBeginPolygon  and  gluTessEndPolygon delimit the definition of a
       convex,	 concave   or	self-intersecting   polygon.	Within	  each
       gluTessBeginPolygon/gluTessEndPolygon  pair,  there must be one or more
       calls to gluTessBeginContour/gluTessEndContour.	Within	each  contour,
       there  are  zero or more calls to gluTessVertex. The vertices specify a
       closed contour (the last vertex of each contour is automatically linked
       to   the   first).   See  the  gluTessVertex,  gluTessBeginContour  and
       gluTessEndContour reference pages for more details.

       Once gluTessEndPolygon is called, the polygon is tessellated,  and  the
       resulting    triangles	 are   described   through   callbacks.    See
       gluTessCallback for descriptions of the callback functions.

EXAMPLE
       A quadrilateral with a triangular hole in  it  can  be  described  like
       this:

       gluTessBeginPolygon(tobj, NULL);
	gluTessBeginContour(tobj);
	  gluTessVertex(tobj, v1, v1);
	  gluTessVertex(tobj, v2, v2);
	  gluTessVertex(tobj, v3, v3);
	  gluTessVertex(tobj, v4, v4);
	gluTessEndContour(tobj);
	gluTessBeginContour(tobj);
	  gluTessVertex(tobj, v5, v5);
	  gluTessVertex(tobj, v6, v6);
	  gluTessVertex(tobj, v7, v7);
	gluTessEndContour(tobj); gluTessEndPolygon(tobj);
       In  the above example the pointers, v1 through v7, should point to dif-
       ferent addresses, since the values stored at these addresses  will  not
       be read by the tesselator until gluTessEndPolygon is called.
