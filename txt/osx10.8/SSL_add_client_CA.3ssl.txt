NAME
       SSL_CTX_set_client_CA_list, SSL_set_client_CA_list,
       SSL_CTX_add_client_CA, SSL_add_client_CA - set list of CAs sent to the
       client when requesting a client certificate

SYNOPSIS
	#include <openssl/ssl.h>

	void SSL_CTX_set_client_CA_list(SSL_CTX *ctx, STACK_OF(X509_NAME) *list);
	void SSL_set_client_CA_list(SSL *s, STACK_OF(X509_NAME) *list);
	int SSL_CTX_add_client_CA(SSL_CTX *ctx, X509 *cacert);
	int SSL_add_client_CA(SSL *ssl, X509 *cacert);

DESCRIPTION
       SSL_CTX_set_client_CA_list() sets the list of CAs sent to the client
       when requesting a client certificate for ctx.

       SSL_set_client_CA_list() sets the list of CAs sent to the client when
       requesting a client certificate for the chosen ssl, overriding the
       setting valid for ssl's SSL_CTX object.

       SSL_CTX_add_client_CA() adds the CA name extracted from cacert to the
       list of CAs sent to the client when requesting a client certificate for
       ctx.

       SSL_add_client_CA() adds the CA name extracted from cacert to the list
       of CAs sent to the client when requesting a client certificate for the
       chosen ssl, overriding the setting valid for ssl's SSL_CTX object.

NOTES
       When a TLS/SSL server requests a client certificate (see
       SSL_CTX_set_verify_options()), it sends a list of CAs, for which it
       will accept certificates, to the client.

       This list must explicitly be set using SSL_CTX_set_client_CA_list() for
       ctx and SSL_set_client_CA_list() for the specific ssl. The list
       specified overrides the previous setting. The CAs listed do not become
       trusted (list only contains the names, not the complete certificates);
       use SSL_CTX_load_verify_locations(3) to additionally load them for
       verification.

       If the list of acceptable CAs is compiled in a file, the
       SSL_load_client_CA_file(3) function can be used to help importing the
       necessary data.

       SSL_CTX_add_client_CA() and SSL_add_client_CA() can be used to add
       additional items the list of client CAs. If no list was specified
       before using SSL_CTX_set_client_CA_list() or SSL_set_client_CA_list(),
       a new client CA list for ctx or ssl (as appropriate) is opened.

       These functions are only useful for TLS/SSL servers.

RETURN VALUES
       SSL_CTX_set_client_CA_list() and SSL_set_client_CA_list() do not return
       diagnostic information.

       SSL_CTX_add_client_CA() and SSL_add_client_CA() have the following
       return values:

       1.  The operation succeeded.

       2.  A failure while manipulating the STACK_OF(X509_NAME) object
	   occurred or the X509_NAME could not be extracted from cacert. Check
	   the error stack to find out the reason.

EXAMPLES
       Scan all certificates in CAfile and list them as acceptable CAs:

	 SSL_CTX_set_client_CA_list(ctx,SSL_load_client_CA_file(CAfile));
