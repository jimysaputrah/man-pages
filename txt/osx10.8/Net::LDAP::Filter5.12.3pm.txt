NAME
       Net::LDAP::Filter - representation of LDAP filters

SYNOPSIS
	 use Net::LDAP::Filter;

	 $filter = Net::LDAP::Filter->new( $filter_str );

DESCRIPTION
       The Net::LDAP::Filter object lets you directly manipulate LDAP filters
       without worrying about the string representation and all the associated
       escaping mechanisms.

CONSTRUCTOR
       new ( FILTER )
	   Create a new object and parse FILTER.

METHODS
       parse ( FILTER )
	   Parse FILTER. The next call to ber will return this filter encoded.

       as_string
	   Return the filter in text form.

       print ( [ FH ] )
	   Print the text representation of the filter to FH, or the currently
	   selected output handle if FH is not given.

FILTER SYNTAX
       Below is the syntax for a filter given in RFC-2254
       http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2254.txt

	filter	     = "(" filtercomp ")"
	filtercomp   = and / or / not / item
	and	     = "&" filterlist
	or	     = "|" filterlist
	not	     = "!" filter
	filterlist   = 1*filter
	item	     = simple / present / substring / extensible
	simple	     = attr filtertype value
	filtertype   = equal / approx / greater / less
	equal	     = "="
	approx	     = "~="
	greater      = ">="
	less	     = "<="
	extensible   = attr [":dn"] [":" matchingrule] ":=" value
		       / [":dn"] ":" matchingrule ":=" value
	present      = attr "=*"
	substring    = attr "=" [initial] any [final]
	initial      = value
	any	     = "*" *(value "*")
	final	     = value
	attr	     = AttributeDescription from Section 4.1.5 of RFC-2251
	matchingrule = MatchingRuleId from Section 4.1.9 of RFC-2251
	value	     = AttributeValue from Section 4.1.6 of RFC-2251
