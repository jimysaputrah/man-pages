DROP SEQUENCE(7)	PostgreSQL 9.1.4 Documentation	      DROP SEQUENCE(7)



NAME
       DROP_SEQUENCE - remove a sequence

SYNOPSIS
       DROP SEQUENCE [ IF EXISTS ] name [, ...] [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ]

DESCRIPTION
       DROP SEQUENCE removes sequence number generators. A sequence can only
       be dropped by its owner or a superuser.

PARAMETERS
       IF EXISTS
	   Do not throw an error if the sequence does not exist. A notice is
	   issued in this case.

       name
	   The name (optionally schema-qualified) of a sequence.

       CASCADE
	   Automatically drop objects that depend on the sequence.

       RESTRICT
	   Refuse to drop the sequence if any objects depend on it. This is
	   the default.

EXAMPLES
       To remove the sequence serial:

	   DROP SEQUENCE serial;

COMPATIBILITY
       DROP SEQUENCE conforms to the SQL standard, except that the standard
       only allows one sequence to be dropped per command, and apart from the
       IF EXISTS option, which is a PostgreSQL extension.

SEE ALSO
       CREATE SEQUENCE (CREATE_SEQUENCE(7)), ALTER SEQUENCE
       (ALTER_SEQUENCE(7))
