NAME
       IO::InnerFile - define a file inside another file

SYNOPSIS
	   ### Read a subset of a file:
	   $inner = IO::InnerFile->new($fh, $start, $length);
	   while (<$inner>) {
	       ...
	   }

DESCRIPTION
       If you have a filehandle that can seek() and tell(), then you can open
       an IO::InnerFile on a range of the underlying file.

PUBLIC INTERFACE
       new FILEHANDLE, [START, [LENGTH]]
	   Class method, constructor.  Create a new inner-file opened on the
	   given FILEHANDLE, from bytes START to START+LENGTH.	Both START and
	   LENGTH default to 0; negative values are silently coerced to zero.

	   Note that FILEHANDLE must be able to seek() and tell(), in addition
	   to whatever other methods you may desire for reading it.

       set_length LENGTH
       get_length
       add_length NBYTES
	   Instance methods.  Get/set the virtual length of the inner file.

       set_start START
       get_start
       add_start NBYTES
	   Instance methods.  Get/set the virtual start position of the inner
	   file.
