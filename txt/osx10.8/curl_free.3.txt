NAME
       curl_free  -  reclaim  memory  that has been obtained through a libcurl
       call

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curl/curl.h>

       void curl_free( char *ptr );

DESCRIPTION
       curl_free reclaims memory that has  been  obtained  through  a  libcurl
       call.   Use  curl_free()  instead of free() to avoid anomalies that can
       result from differences in memory management between  your  application
       and libcurl.
