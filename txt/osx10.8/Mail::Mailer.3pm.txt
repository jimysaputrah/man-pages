NAME
       Mail::Mailer - Simple interface to electronic mailing mechanisms

INHERITANCE
	Mail::Mailer
	  is a IO::Handle

SYNOPSIS
	 use Mail::Mailer;
	 use Mail::Mailer qw(mail);    # specifies default mailer

	 $mailer = Mail::Mailer->new;
	 $mailer = Mail::Mailer->new($type, @args);

	 $mailer->open(\%headers);
	 print $mailer $body;
	 $mailer->close
	     or die "couldn't send whole message: $!\n";

DESCRIPTION
       Sends mail using any of the built-in methods.  As TYPE argument to
       new(), you can specify any of

       "sendmail"
	   Use the "sendmail" program to deliver the mail.

       "smtp"
	   Use the "smtp" protocol via Net::SMTP to deliver the mail. The
	   server to use can be specified in @args with

	    $mailer = Mail::Mailer->new('smtp', Server => $server);

	   The smtp mailer does not handle "Cc" and "Bcc" lines, neither their
	   "Resent-*" fellows. The "Debug" options enables debugging output
	   from "Net::SMTP".

	   You may also use the "Auth => [ $user, $password ]" option for SASL
	   authentication. To make this work, you have to install the
	   Authen::SASL distribution yourself: it is not automatically
	   installed.

       "smtps"
	   Use the smtp over ssl protocol via Net::SMTP::SSL to deliver the
	   mail.  Usage is identical to "smtp". You have to install
	   Authen::SASL as well.

	    $mailer = Mail::Mailer->new('smtps', Server => $server);

       "qmail"
	   Use qmail's qmail-inject program to deliver the mail.

       "testfile"
	   Used for debugging, this displays the data to the file named in
	   $Mail::Mailer::testfile::config{outfile} which defaults to a file
	   named "mailer.testfile".  No mail is ever sent.

       "Mail::Mailer" will search for executables in the above order. The
       default mailer will be the first one found.

METHODS
   Constructors
       Mail::Mailer->new(TYPE, ARGS)
	   The TYPE is one of the back-end sender implementations, as
	   described in the DESCRIPTION chapter of this manual page.  The ARGS
	   are passed to that back-end.

       $obj->open(HASH)
	   The HASH consists of key and value pairs, the key being the name of
	   the header field (eg, "To"), and the value being the corresponding
	   contents of the header field.  The value can either be a scalar
	   (eg, "gnat@frii.com") or a reference to an array of scalars ("eg,
	   ['gnat@frii.com', 'Tim.Bunce@ig.co.uk']").

DETAILS
   ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       PERL_MAILERS
	   Augments/override the build in choice for binary used to send out
	   our mail messages.

	   Format:

	       "type1:mailbinary1;mailbinary2;...:type2:mailbinaryX;...:..."

	   Example: assume you want you use private sendmail binary instead of
	   mailx, one could set "PERL_MAILERS" to:

	       "mail:/does/not/exists:sendmail:$HOME/test/bin/sendmail"

	   On systems which may include ":" in file names, use "|" as
	   separator between type-groups.

	       "mail:c:/does/not/exists|sendmail:$HOME/test/bin/sendmail"

   BUGS
       Mail::Mailer does not help with folding, and does not protect against
       various web-script hacker attacks, for instance where a new-line is
       inserted in the content of the field.
