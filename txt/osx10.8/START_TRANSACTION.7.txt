START TRANSACTION(7)	PostgreSQL 9.1.4 Documentation	  START TRANSACTION(7)



NAME
       START_TRANSACTION - start a transaction block

SYNOPSIS
       START TRANSACTION [ transaction_mode [, ...] ]

       where transaction_mode is one of:

	   ISOLATION LEVEL { SERIALIZABLE | REPEATABLE READ | READ COMMITTED | READ UNCOMMITTED }
	   READ WRITE | READ ONLY
	   [ NOT ] DEFERRABLE

DESCRIPTION
       This command begins a new transaction block. If the isolation level,
       read/write mode, or deferrable mode is specified, the new transaction
       has those characteristics, as if SET TRANSACTION (SET_TRANSACTION(7))
       was executed. This is the same as the BEGIN(7) command.

PARAMETERS
       Refer to SET TRANSACTION (SET_TRANSACTION(7)) for information on the
       meaning of the parameters to this statement.

COMPATIBILITY
       In the standard, it is not necessary to issue START TRANSACTION to
       start a transaction block: any SQL command implicitly begins a block.
       PostgreSQL's behavior can be seen as implicitly issuing a COMMIT after
       each command that does not follow START TRANSACTION (or BEGIN), and it
       is therefore often called "autocommit". Other relational database
       systems might offer an autocommit feature as a convenience.

       The DEFERRABLE transaction_mode is a PostgreSQL language extension.

       The SQL standard requires commas between successive transaction_modes,
       but for historical reasons PostgreSQL allows the commas to be omitted.

       See also the compatibility section of SET TRANSACTION
       (SET_TRANSACTION(7)).
