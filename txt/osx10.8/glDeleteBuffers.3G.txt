NAME
       glDeleteBuffers - delete named buffer objects

C SPECIFICATION
       void glDeleteBuffers(GLsizei n, const GLuint * buffers);

PARAMETERS
       n
	   Specifies the number of buffer objects to be deleted.

       buffers
	   Specifies an array of buffer objects to be deleted.

DESCRIPTION
       glDeleteBuffers deletes n buffer objects named by the elements of the
       array buffers. After a buffer object is deleted, it has no contents,
       and its name is free for reuse (for example by glGenBuffers()). If a
       buffer object that is currently bound is deleted, the binding reverts
       to 0 (the absence of any buffer object).


       glDeleteBuffers silently ignores 0's and names that do not correspond
       to existing buffer objects.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if n is negative.

ASSOCIATED GETS
       glIsBuffer()
