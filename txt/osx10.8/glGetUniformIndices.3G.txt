GLGETUNIFORMINDICES(3G) 	  OpenGL 3.3	       GLGETUNIFORMINDICES(3G)



NAME
       glGetUniformIndices - retrieve the index of a named uniform block

C SPECIFICATION
       GLuint glGetUniformIndices(GLuint program, GLsizei uniformCount,
				  const GLchar **uniformNames,
				  GLuint *uniformIndices);

PARAMETERS
       program
	   Specifies the name of a program containing uniforms whose indices
	   to query.

       uniformCount
	   Specifies the number of uniforms whose indices to query.

       uniformNames
	   Specifies the address of an array of pointers to buffers containing
	   the names of the queried uniforms.

       uniformIndices
	   Specifies the address of an array that will receive the indices of
	   the uniforms.

DESCRIPTION
       glGetUniformIndices retrieves the indices of a number of uniforms
       within program.


       program must be the name of a program object for which the command
       glLinkProgram() must have been called in the past, although it is not
       required that glLinkProgram() must have succeeded. The link could have
       failed because the number of active uniforms exceeded the limit.


       uniformCount indicates both the number of elements in the array of
       names uniformNames and the number of indices that may be written to
       uniformIndices.


       uniformNames contains a list of uniformCount name strings identifying
       the uniform names to be queried for indices. For each name string in
       uniformNames, the index assigned to the active uniform of that name
       will be written to the corresponding element of uniformIndices. If a
       string in uniformNames is not the name of an active uniform, the
       special value GL_INVALID_INDEX will be written to the corresponding
       element of uniformIndices.

       If an error occurs, nothing is written to uniformIndices.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if program is not the name of a
       program object for which glLinkProgram() has been called in the past.

NOTES
       glGetUniformIndices is available only if the GL version is 3.1 or
       greater.
