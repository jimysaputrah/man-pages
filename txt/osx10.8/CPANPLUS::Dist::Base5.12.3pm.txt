NAME
       CPANPLUS::Dist::Base - Base class for custom distribution classes

SYNOPSIS
	   package CPANPLUS::Dist::MY_IMPLEMENTATION

	   use base 'CPANPLUS::Dist::Base';

	   sub prepare {
	       my $dist = shift;

	       ### do the 'standard' things
	       $dist->SUPER::prepare( @_ ) or return;

	       ### do MY_IMPLEMENTATION specific things
	       ...

	       ### don't forget to set the status!
	       return $dist->status->prepared( $SUCCESS ? 1 : 0 );
	   }

DESCRIPTION
       CPANPLUS::Dist::Base functions as a base class for all custom
       distribution implementations. It does all the mundane work CPANPLUS
       would have done without a custom distribution, so you can override just
       the parts you need to make your own implementation work.

FLOW
       Below is a brief outline when and in which order methods in this class
       are called:

	   $Class->format_available;   # can we use this class on this system?

	   $dist->init; 	       # set up custom accessors, etc
	   $dist->prepare;	       # find/write meta information
	   $dist->create;	       # write the distribution file
	   $dist->install;	       # install the distribution file

	   $dist->uninstall;	       # remove the distribution (OPTIONAL)

METHODS
   @subs = $Class->methods
       Returns a list of methods that this class implements that you can
       override.

   $bool = $Class->format_available
       This method is called when someone requests a module to be installed
       via the superclass. This gives you the opportunity to check if all the
       needed requirements to build and install this distribution have been
       met.

       For example, you might need a command line program, or a certain perl
       module installed to do your job. Now is the time to check.

       Simply return true if the request can proceed and false if it can not.

       The "CPANPLUS::Dist::Base" implementation always returns true.

   $bool = $dist->init
       This method is called just after the new dist object is set up and
       before the "prepare" method is called. This is the time to set up the
       object so it can be used with your class.

       For example, you might want to add extra accessors to the "status"
       object, which you might do as follows:

	   $dist->status->mk_accessors( qw[my_implementation_accessor] );

       The "status" object is implemented as an instance of the
       "Object::Accessor" class. Please refer to its documentation for
       details.

       Return true if the initialization was successul, and false if it was
       not.

       The "CPANPLUS::Dist::Base" implementation does not alter your object
       and always returns true.

   $bool = $dist->prepare
       This runs the preparation step of your distribution. This step is meant
       to set up the environment so the "create" step can create the actual
       distribution(file).  A "prepare" call in the standard
       "ExtUtils::MakeMaker" distribution would, for example, run "perl
       Makefile.PL" to find the dependencies for a distribution. For a
       "debian" distribution, this is where you would write all the metafiles
       required for the "dpkg-*" tools.

       The "CPANPLUS::Dist::Base" implementation simply calls the underlying
       distribution class (Typically "CPANPLUS::Dist::MM" or
       "CPANPLUS::Dist::Build").

       Sets "$dist->status->prepared" to the return value of this function.
       If you override this method, you should make sure to set this value.

   $bool = $dist->create
       This runs the creation step of your distribution. This step is meant to
       follow up on the "prepare" call, that set up your environment so the
       "create" step can create the actual distribution(file).	A "create"
       call in the standard "ExtUtils::MakeMaker" distribution would, for
       example, run "make" and "make test" to build and test a distribution.
       For a "debian" distribution, this is where you would create the actual
       ".deb" file using "dpkg".

       The "CPANPLUS::Dist::Base" implementation simply calls the underlying
       distribution class (Typically "CPANPLUS::Dist::MM" or
       "CPANPLUS::Dist::Build").

       Sets "$dist->status->dist" to the location of the created distribution.
       If you override this method, you should make sure to set this value.

       Sets "$dist->status->created" to the return value of this function.  If
       you override this method, you should make sure to set this value.

   $bool = $dist->install
       This runs the install step of your distribution. This step is meant to
       follow up on the "create" call, which prepared a distribution(file) to
       install.  A "create" call in the standard "ExtUtils::MakeMaker"
       distribution would, for example, run "make install" to copy the
       distribution files to their final destination. For a "debian"
       distribution, this is where you would run "dpkg --install" on the
       created ".deb" file.

       The "CPANPLUS::Dist::Base" implementation simply calls the underlying
       distribution class (Typically "CPANPLUS::Dist::MM" or
       "CPANPLUS::Dist::Build").

       Sets "$dist->status->installed" to the return value of this function.
       If you override this method, you should make sure to set this value.

   $bool = $dist->uninstall
       This runs the uninstall step of your distribution. This step is meant
       to remove the distribution from the file system.  A "uninstall" call in
       the standard "ExtUtils::MakeMaker" distribution would, for example, run
       "make uninstall" to remove the distribution files the file system. For
       a "debian" distribution, this is where you would run "dpkg --uninstall
       PACKAGE".

       The "CPANPLUS::Dist::Base" implementation simply calls the underlying
       distribution class (Typically "CPANPLUS::Dist::MM" or
       "CPANPLUS::Dist::Build").

       Sets "$dist->status->uninstalled" to the return value of this function.
       If you override this method, you should make sure to set this value.
