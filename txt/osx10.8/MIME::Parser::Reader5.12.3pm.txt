NAME
       MIME::Parser::Reader - a line-oriented reader for a MIME::Parser

SYNOPSIS
       This module is used internally by MIME::Parser; you probably don't need
       to be looking at it at all.  But just in case...

	   ### Create a top-level reader, where chunks end at EOF:
	   $rdr = MIME::Parser::Reader->new();

	   ### Spawn a child reader, where chunks also end at a boundary:
	   $subrdr = $rdr->spawn->add_boundary($bound);

	   ### Spawn a child reader, where chunks also end at a given string:
	   $subrdr = $rdr->spawn->add_terminator($string);

	   ### Read until boundary or terminator:
	   $subrdr->read_chunk($in, $out);

DESCRIPTION
       A line-oriented reader which can deal with virtual end-of-stream
       defined by a collection of boundaries.

       Warning: this is a private class solely for use by MIME::Parser.  This
       class has no official public interface
