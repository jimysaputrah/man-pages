DESCRIPTION
       The prl_disk_tool utility is used to manage Parallels virtual disks and
       to prepare native partitions to boot into Parallels virtual machines.


COMMANDS
       resize
	   Changes  the  capacity of the specified virtual disk. During resiz-
	   ing, all data present on the disk volumes are left intact.  You can
	   also resize the last partition using the --resize_partition option.
	   The supported file systems are NTFS, FAT 16/32, and ext2/ext3.

       compact
	   Removes all empty blocks from expanding Parallels virtual disks and
	   reduces  their  size  on your real disk. Compacting is performed by
	   scanning file systems for unused clusters and cleaning  the	corre-
	   sponding   disk  blocks.  The  supported  file  systems  are  NTFS,
	   FAT16/32, ext2/ext3. You can also try to compact disks with	unsup-
	   ported file system types using the --buildmap option.

       merge
	   Merges all snapshots of the virtual hard disk.

       validate
	   Validates the operating system on the virtual hard disk.

       configure
	   Prepares a disk or real Boot Camp partition for booting into a Par-
	   allels virtual machine.

       convert
	   Converts the virtual hard disk into another format.

       encrypt
	   Encrypts data on the specified virtual hard disk image.

       decrypt
	   Decrypts data on the specified virtual hard disk.


OPTIONS
   Common options:
       The following options can be used with the  majority  of  prl_disk_tool
       commands.

       --hdd <disk_name>
	      This option is mandatory and specifies the full path to the disk
	      to be configured or compacted.

       --comm <memory_name>
	      This parameter is not currently used.


   Disk resizing:
       --size <size>[M|G]
	      Set the virtual hard disk size in MB (by default) or GB.

       --resize_partition
	      Resize the last partition and its file system while resizing the
	      disk.  The  supported  file  system  types  are  NTFS, FAT16/32,
	      ext2/ext3.

       --force
	      Forcibly drop the suspended state before resizing the disk.

       --split
	      Split the virtual hard disk by 2 GB.

       -i,--info
	      Display the capacity of the specified virtual disk as it is seen
	      from  inside the virtual machine, without resizing the disk. The
	      information is shown as a table with the following columns:

	      Size:		   <size>M
		     The current virtual disk capacity.
	      Minimum:		   <size>M
		     The minimum possible capacity of the virtual  disk  after
	      resizing the disk using the --resize_partition option.
	      Minimum:		    <size>M  (without resizing the last parti-
	      tion)
		     The minimum possible capacity of the virtual  disk  after
	      resizing the disk without using the --resize_partition option.

	      Keep  in	mind  that  for an expanding virtual disk the capacity
	      shown from inside the virtual machine  and  the  size  the  disk
	      occupies on the real physical disk may differ.

       --units <K|M|G>
	      Used  with  the --info option, shows the disk size in KB, MB, or
	      GB.


   Disk compacting:
       --buildmap
	      If this option is specified, the	utility  scans	the  specified
	      disk  for  empty blocks one by one and removes all blocks filled
	      with zeroes.

       --exclude-pagefile
	      If this option is specified, the utility will  remove  the  page
	      file from the disk while compacting it. Do nothing if --buildmap
	      option is used.

       --force
	      Forcibly drop the suspended state before resizing the disk.

       -i,--info
	      Show the estimated disk size after the compaction  without  com-
	      pacting the disk. The results will be shown as:

	      Block size:			<size>
		     Block size, in sectors. Each sector is 512 bytes.
	      Total blocks:	       <sectors_count>
		     Total  blocks in the disk image (according to the virtual
	      disk image capacity).
	      Allocated blocks:        <sectors_count>
		     The number of blocks that are actually allocated  to  and
	      keeping space on your hard drive.
	      Used blocks:	       <sectors_count>
		     The  number  of  blocks  actually used in the disk image.
	      This number of blocks will be left after compacting the disk.

   Configuration:
       --boot <boot_driver>
	      Specifies the full path to the Parallels boot driver.

       --para <paravirt_driver>
	      Specifies the full  path	to  the  Parallels  paravirtualization
	      driver.

       --toolsag <tools_install_helper>
	      Specifies the full path to the PTIAgent.exe file used to config-
	      ure Boot Camp virtual machines.

       --force
	      Forcibly configure Boot Camp even if it was  configured  in  the
	      previous version.

   Conversion
       --expanding
	      reduce  the  size  of  a plain disk to the actual amount of data
	      stored on it and make it expandable allowing it to grow in  size
	      as the amount of data grows.

       --plain
	      convert an expandable disk to a disk of fixed capacity that can-
	      not grow in size.

       --split
	      split the data stored on the  virtual  hard  disk  into  smaller
	      parts of 2 GB each, and improve the virtual machine performance.

       --merge
	      merge all parts of a split disk into one file.

   Encryption
       --force
	      Forcibly encrypt the virtual hard disk even when it  is  already
	      encrypted.
