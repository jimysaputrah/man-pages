NAME
       curl_easy_cleanup - End a libcurl easy session

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curl/curl.h>

       void curl_easy_cleanup(CURL *handle);


DESCRIPTION
       This function must be the last function to call for an easy session. It
       is the opposite of the curl_easy_init(3) function and  must  be	called
       with the same handle as input that the curl_easy_init call returned.

       This  will  effectively	close all connections this handle has used and
       possibly has kept open until now.  Don't  call  this  function  if  you
       intend to transfer more files.

       Occasionally  you  may  get  your  progress callback or header callback
       called from within curl_easy_cleanup(3) (if previously set for the han-
       dle  using  curl_easy_setopt(3)).  Like if libcurl decides to shut down
       the connection and the protocol is of  a  kind  that  requires  a  com-
       mand/response  sequence	before	disconnect. Examples of such protocols
       are FTP, POP3 and IMAP.

       Any uses of the handle after this function has  been  called  and  have
       returned,  are illegal. This kills the handle and all memory associated
       with it!

       With libcurl versions prior to 7.17.: when you've called this, you  can
       safely remove all the strings you've previously told libcurl to use, as
       it won't use them anymore now.

RETURN VALUE
       None
