NAME
       cvfsid - Display SNFS System Identifier

SYNOPSIS
       /usr/cvfs/bin/cvfsid [-?] [-G] [-h] [-n] [-l]



DESCRIPTION
       cvfsid  provides a mechanism for displaying the SNFS identifier for the
       executing system.  For customers  using	client-based  licensing,  SNFS
       identifiers  are  used  to  generate  individual client licenses.  This
       identifier string is submitted to Quantum Technical Support for license
       authorization  keys.   See the installation instructions for additional
       information on SNFS licensing.

OPTIONS
       [-h] [-?]
	      Display help

       [-G]   Gather mode.  NOTE: Not intended for general use.  Only use when
	      recommended by Quantum Support.

       [-l]   List  the  local host's Authorizing IDs, IP addresses, and MACs.
	      (Linux only.)

       [-n]   Display the network interface information in a compact,  machine
	      readable form

       When  executed  without options, cvfsid prints the information required
       to generate a license for the host on which  it	is  executed.	Simply
       execute	the  program on each participating system, and either Email or
       Fax the identifiers to  Quantum	Technical  Support  for  authorization
       keys.

       After  the  license  keys are received cut-and-paste them into the file
       /usr/cvfs/config/license.dat on the system that runs the CVFS File Sys-
       tem Manager.
