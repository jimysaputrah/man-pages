NAME
       DBIx::Class::Exception - Exception objects for DBIx::Class

DESCRIPTION
       Exception objects of this class are used internally by the default
       error handling of "throw_exception" in DBIx::Class::Schema and
       derivatives.

       These objects stringify to the contained error message, and use
       overload fallback to give natural boolean/numeric values.

METHODS
   throw
       Arguments: $exception_scalar, $stacktrace

       This is meant for internal use by DBIx::Class's "throw_exception" code,
       and shouldn't be used directly elsewhere.

       Expects a scalar exception message.  The optional argument $stacktrace
       tells it to output a full trace similar to "confess" in Carp.

	 DBIx::Class::Exception->throw('Foo');
	 try { ... } catch { DBIx::Class::Exception->throw(shift) }

   rethrow
       This method provides some syntactic sugar in order to re-throw
       exceptions.
