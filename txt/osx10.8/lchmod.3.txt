NAME
     lchmod -- change mode of file

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/stat.h>
     #include <unistd.h>

     int
     lchmod(const char *path, mode_t flags);

DESCRIPTION
     The function lchmod() sets the file permission bits of the file specified
     by the pathname path to mode.  See chmod(2) for the values of the flags.

     The lchmod() call is like chmod() except when the named file is a sym-
     bolic link, in which case lchmod() will change the flags of the link
     itself, rather than the file it points to.

NOTE
     Instead of being a system call, lchmod() is emulated using
     setattrlist(2).  Not all file systems support setattrlist(2).

RETURN VALUES
     Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned.  Otherwise, -1 is
     returned and the global variable errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
     The lchmod() call may return the same errors as chmod(2) and
     setattrlist(2).
