NAME
       glPushMatrix, glPopMatrix - push and pop the current matrix stack


C SPECIFICATION
       void glPushMatrix( void )


C SPECIFICATION
       void glPopMatrix( void )


DESCRIPTION
       There  is  a  stack  of	matrices  for  each  of  the matrix modes.  In
       GL_MODELVIEW mode, the stack depth is at least 32.  In the other modes,
       GL_COLOR,  const(PROJECTION),  and GL_TEXTURE, the depth is at least 2.
       The current matrix in any mode is the matrix on the top	of  the  stack
       for that mode.

       glPushMatrix  pushes  the current matrix stack down by one, duplicating
       the current matrix.  That is, after a glPushMatrix call, the matrix  on
       top of the stack is identical to the one below it.

       glPopMatrix pops the current matrix stack, replacing the current matrix
       with the one below it on the stack.

       Initially, each of the stacks contains one matrix, an identity  matrix.

       It  is  an  error to push a full matrix stack, or to pop a matrix stack
       that contains only a single matrix.  In either case, the error flag  is
       set and no other change is made to GL state.

ERRORS
       GL_STACK_OVERFLOW is generated if glPushMatrix is called while the cur-
       rent matrix stack is full.

       GL_STACK_UNDERFLOW is generated if glPopMatrix is called while the cur-
       rent matrix stack contains only a single matrix.

       GL_INVALID_OPERATION  is  generated  if	glPushMatrix or glPopMatrix is
       executed between the execution of glBegin and the corresponding	execu-
       tion of glEnd.
