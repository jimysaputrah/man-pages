NAME
       DBIx::Class::CDBICompat::NoObjectIndex - Defines empty methods for
       object indexing. They do nothing

SYNOPSIS
	   Part of CDBICompat

DESCRIPTION
       Defines empty methods for object indexing.  They do nothing.

       Using NoObjectIndex instead of LiveObjectIndex and nocache(1) is a
       little faster because it removes code from the object insert and
       retrieve chains.
