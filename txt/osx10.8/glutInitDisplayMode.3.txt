NAME
       glutInitDisplayMode - sets the initial display mode.

SYNTAX
       #include <GLUT/glut.h>

       void glutInitDisplayMode(unsigned int mode);

ARGUMENTS
       mode	 Display  mode,  normally  the	bitwise OR-ing of GLUT display
		 mode bit masks.  See values below:

       GLUT_RGBA
	       Bit mask to select an RGBA mode window. This is the default  if
	       neither GLUT_RGBA nor GLUT_INDEX are specified.

       GLUT_RGB
	       An alias for GLUT_RGBA.

       GLUT_INDEX
	       Bit  mask  to  select a color index mode window. This overrides
	       GLUT_RGBA if it is also specified.  Note that color index modes
	       are not supported on Mac OS X.

       GLUT_SINGLE
	       Bit  mask  to  select  a  single  buffered  window. This is the
	       default if neither GLUT_DOUBLE or GLUT_SINGLE are specified.

       GLUT_DOUBLE
	       Bit mask to select a double  buffered  window.  This  overrides
	       GLUT_SINGLE if it is also specified.

       GLUT_ACCUM
	       Bit mask to select a window with an accumulation buffer.

       GLUT_ALPHA
	       Bit  mask  to  select  a  window with an alpha component to the
	       color buffer(s).

       GLUT_DEPTH
	       Bit mask to select a window with a depth buffer.

       GLUT_STENCIL
	       Bit mask to select a window with a stencil buffer.

       GLUT_MULTISAMPLE
	       Bit mask to select a window with multisampling support. If mul-
	       tisampling  is  not  available, a non-multisampling window will
	       automatically be chosen. Note: both the OpenGL client-side  and
	       server-side  implementations  must  support the GLX_SAMPLE_SGIS
	       extension for multisampling to be available.

       GLUT_STEREO
	       Bit mask to select a stereo window.

       GLUT_LUMINANCE
	       Bit mask to select a window with a ``luminance''  color	model.
	       This  model  provides  the functionality of OpenGL's RGBA color
	       model, but the green and blue components are not maintained  in
	       the  frame  buffer.  Instead each pixel's red component is con-
	       verted to an index between  zero  and  glutGet(GLUT_WINDOW_COL-
	       ORMAP_SIZE)-1 and looked up in a per-window color map to deter-
	       mine the color of pixels within the window.  The  initial  col-
	       ormap  of  GLUT_LUMINANCE windows is initialized to be a linear
	       gray ramp, but can be modified with GLUT's colormap routines.

DESCRIPTION
       The initial display mode is used when creating top-level windows,  sub-
       windows,  and overlays to determine the OpenGL display mode for the to-
       be-created window or overlay.

       Note that GLUT_RGBA selects the RGBA  color  model,  but  it  does  not
       request any bits of alpha (sometimes called an alpha buffer or destina-
       tion alpha) be allocated. To request  alpha,  specify  GLUT_ALPHA.  The
       same applies to GLUT_LUMINANCE.

       The  glutInitDisplayString  routine  provides  a  more  powerful way to
       select frame buffer capabilities for GLUT windows.

GLUT_LUMINANCE IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
       GLUT_LUMINANCE is not supported on most OpenGL platforms.
