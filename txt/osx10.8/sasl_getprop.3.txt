NAME
       sasl_getprop - Get a SASL property



SYNOPSIS
       #include <sasl/sasl.h>


       int sasl_getprop(sasl_conn_t *conn,
		       int propnum,
		       const void ** pvalue);


DESCRIPTION
       sasl_getprop  gets the value of a SASL property. For example after suc-
       cessful authentication a server may  wish  to  know  the  authorization
       name.  Or  a  client  application  may wish to know the strength of the
       negotiated security layer.

       conn is the SASL connection object.  propnum is the identifier for  the
       property  requested and pvalue is filled in on success. List of proper-
       ties follows:

       SASL_USERNAME	 -  pointer to NUL terminated user name
       SASL_SSF 	 -  security layer security strength factor,
			    if 0, call to sasl_encode, sasl_decode unnecessary
       SASL_MAXOUTBUF	 -  security layer max output buf unsigned
       SASL_DEFUSERREALM -  server authentication realm used
       SASL_GETOPTCTX	 -  context for getopt callback
       SASL_IPLOCALPORT  -  local address string
       SASL_IPREMOTEPORT -  remote address string
       SASL_SERVICE	 -  service passed to sasl_*_new
       SASL_SERVERFQDN	 -  serverFQDN passed to sasl_*_new
       SASL_AUTHSOURCE	 -  name of auth source last used, useful for failed
			    authentication tracking
       SASL_MECHNAME	 -  active mechanism name, if any
       SASL_PLUGERR	 -  similar to sasl_errdetail




RETURN VALUE
       Returns SASL_OK on success. SASL error code on failure.
