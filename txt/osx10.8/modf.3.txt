NAME
     modf -- return integral and fractional parts

SYNOPSIS
     #include <math.h>

     double
     modf(double value, double *iptr);

     long double
     modfl(long double value, long double *iptr);

     float
     modff(float value, float *iptr);

DESCRIPTION
     The modf() break value into integral and fractional parts, each of which
     has the same sign as the argument.  They return the fractional part, and
     store the integral part (as a floating-point number) in the object
     pointed to by iptr

SPECIAL VALUES
     modf(+-infinity, iptr) returns +-0 and stores +-infinity in the object
     pointed to by iptr.

     modf(NaN, iptr) returns a NaN and stores a NaN in the object pointed to
     by iptr.

SEE ALSO
     frexp(3), ldexp(3), math(3)

STANDARDS
     The modf() functions conform to ISO/IEC 9899:1999(E).
