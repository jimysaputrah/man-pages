NAME
       PPI::Token::Label - Token class for a statement label

INHERITANCE
	 PPI::Token::Label
	 isa PPI::Token
	     isa PPI::Element

DESCRIPTION
       A label is an identifier attached to a line or statements, to allow for
       various types of flow control. For example, a loop might have a label
       attached so that a "last" or "next" flow control statement can be used
       from multiple levels below to reference the loop directly.

METHODS
       There are no additional methods beyond those provided by the parent
       PPI::Token and PPI::Element classes.
