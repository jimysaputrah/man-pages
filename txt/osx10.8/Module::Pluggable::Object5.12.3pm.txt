NAME
       Module::Pluggable::Object - automatically give your module the ability
       to have plugins

SYNOPSIS
       Simple use Module::Pluggable -

	   package MyClass;
	   use Module::Pluggable::Object;

	   my $finder = Module::Pluggable::Object->new(%opts);
	   print "My plugins are: ".join(", ", $finder->plugins)."\n";

DESCRIPTION
       Provides a simple but, hopefully, extensible way of having 'plugins'
       for your module. Obviously this isn't going to be the be all and end
       all of solutions but it works for me.

       Essentially all it does is export a method into your namespace that
       looks through a search path for .pm files and turn those into class
       names.

       Optionally it instantiates those classes for you.

       This object is wrapped by "Module::Pluggable". If you want to do
       something odd or add non-general special features you're probably best
       to wrap this and produce your own subclass.

OPTIONS
       See the "Module::Pluggable" docs.
