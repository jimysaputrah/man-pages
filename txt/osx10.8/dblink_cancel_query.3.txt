DBLINK_CANCEL_QUERY(3)	PostgreSQL 9.1.4 Documentation	DBLINK_CANCEL_QUERY(3)



NAME
       dblink_cancel_query - cancels any active query on the named connection

SYNOPSIS
       dblink_cancel_query(text connname) returns text

DESCRIPTION
       dblink_cancel_query attempts to cancel any query that is in progress on
       the named connection. Note that this is not certain to succeed (since,
       for example, the remote query might already have finished). A cancel
       request simply improves the odds that the query will fail soon. You
       must still complete the normal query protocol, for example by calling
       dblink_get_result.

ARGUMENTS
       conname
	   Name of the connection to use.

RETURN VALUE
       Returns OK if the cancel request has been sent, or the text of an error
       message on failure.

EXAMPLES
	   SELECT dblink_cancel_query('dtest1');
