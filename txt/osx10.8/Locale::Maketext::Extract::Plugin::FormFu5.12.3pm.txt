NAME
       Locale::Maketext::Extract::Plugin::FormFu - FormFu format parser

SYNOPSIS
	   $plugin = Locale::Maketext::Extract::Plugin::FormFu->new(
	       $lexicon 	   # A Locale::Maketext::Extract object
	       @file_types	   # Optionally specify a list of recognised file types
	   )

	   $plugin->extract($filename,$filecontents);

DESCRIPTION
       HTML::FormFu uses a config-file to generate forms, with built in
       support for localizing errors, labels etc.

SHORT PLUGIN NAME
	   formfu

VALID FORMATS
       We extract the text after any key which ends in "_loc":

	   content_loc: this is the string
	   message_loc: ['Max length [_1]', 10]

KNOWN FILE TYPES
       .yaml
       .yml
       .conf

REQUIRES
       YAML

NOTES
       The docs for the YAML module describes it as alpha code. It is not as
       tolerant of errors as YAML::Syck. However, because it is pure Perl, it
       is easy to hook into.

       I have seen it enter endless loops, so if xgettext.pl hangs, try
       running it again with "--verbose --verbose" (twice) enabled, so that
       you can see if the fault lies with YAML.  If it does, either correct
       the YAML source file, or use the file_types to exclude that file.

SEE ALSO
       xgettext.pl
	   for extracting translatable strings from common template systems
	   and perl source files.
