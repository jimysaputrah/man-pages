DBLINK_CONNECT_U(3)	PostgreSQL 9.1.4 Documentation	   DBLINK_CONNECT_U(3)



NAME
       dblink_connect_u - opens a persistent connection to a remote database,
       insecurely

SYNOPSIS
       dblink_connect_u(text connstr) returns text
       dblink_connect_u(text connname, text connstr) returns text

DESCRIPTION
       dblink_connect_u() is identical to dblink_connect(), except that it
       will allow non-superusers to connect using any authentication method.

       If the remote server selects an authentication method that does not
       involve a password, then impersonation and subsequent escalation of
       privileges can occur, because the session will appear to have
       originated from the user as which the local PostgreSQL server runs.
       Also, even if the remote server does demand a password, it is possible
       for the password to be supplied from the server environment, such as a
       ~/.pgpass file belonging to the server's user. This opens not only a
       risk of impersonation, but the possibility of exposing a password to an
       untrustworthy remote server. Therefore, dblink_connect_u() is initially
       installed with all privileges revoked from PUBLIC, making it
       un-callable except by superusers. In some situations it may be
       appropriate to grant EXECUTE permission for dblink_connect_u() to
       specific users who are considered trustworthy, but this should be done
       with care. It is also recommended that any ~/.pgpass file belonging to
       the server's user not contain any records specifying a wildcard host
       name.

       For further details see dblink_connect().
