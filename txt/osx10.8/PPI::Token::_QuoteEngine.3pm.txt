NAME
       PPI::Token::_QuoteEngine - The PPI Quote Engine

DESCRIPTION
       The "PPI::Token::_QuoteEngine" package is designed hold functionality
       for processing quotes and quote like operators, including regexes.
       These have special requirements in parsing.

       The "PPI::Token::_QuoteEngine" package itself provides various parsing
       methods, which the PPI::Token::Quote, PPI::Token::QuoteLike and
       PPI::Token::Regexp can inherit from. In this sense, it serves as a base
       class.

   Using this class
       (Refers only to internal uses. This class does not provide a public
       interface)

       To use these, you should initialize them as normal '$Class->new', and
       then call the 'fill' method, which will cause the specialised parser to
       scan forwards and parse the quote to its end point.

       If ->fill returns true, finalise the token.

SUPPORT
       See the support section in the main module.
