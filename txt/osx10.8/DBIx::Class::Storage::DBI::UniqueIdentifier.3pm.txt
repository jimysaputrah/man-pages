NAME
       DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::UniqueIdentifier - Storage component for
       RDBMSes supporting GUID types

DESCRIPTION
       This is a storage component for databases that support GUID types such
       as "uniqueidentifier", "uniqueidentifierstr" or "guid".

       GUIDs are generated automatically for PK columns with a supported
       data_type, as well as non-PK with auto_nextval set.

METHODS
   new_guid
       The composing class must set "new_guid" to the method used to generate
       a new GUID. It can also set it to "undef", in which case the user is
       required to set it, or a runtime error will be thrown. It can be:

       string
	   In which case it is used as the name of database function to create
	   a new GUID,

       coderef
	   In which case the coderef should return a string GUID, using
	   Data::GUID, or whatever GUID generation method you prefer.

       For example:

	 $schema->storage->new_guid(sub { Data::GUID->new->as_string });
