NAME
       CPANPLUS::Internals::Extract

SYNOPSIS
	   ### for source files ###
	   $self->_gunzip( file => 'foo.gz', output => 'blah.txt' );

	   ### for modules/packages ###
	   $dir = $self->_extract( module      => $modobj,
				   extractdir  => '/some/where' );

DESCRIPTION
       CPANPLUS::Internals::Extract extracts compressed files for CPANPLUS.
       It can do this by either a pure perl solution (preferred) with the use
       of "Archive::Tar" and "Compress::Zlib", or with binaries, like "gzip"
       and "tar".

       The flow looks like this:

	   $cb->_extract
	       Delegate to Archive::Extract

METHODS
   $dir = _extract( module => $modobj, [perl => '/path/to/perl', extractdir =>
       '/path/to/extract/to', prefer_bin => BOOL, verbose => BOOL, force =>
       BOOL] )
       "_extract" will take a module object and extract it to "extractdir" if
       provided, or the default location which is obtained from your config.

       The file name is obtained by looking at "$modobj->status->fetch" and
       will be parsed to see if it's a tar or zip archive.

       If it's a zip archive, "__unzip" will be called, otherwise "__untar"
       will be called. In the unlikely event the file is of neither format, an
       error will be thrown.

       "_extract" takes the following options:

       module
	   A "CPANPLUS::Module" object. This is required.

       extractdir
	   The directory to extract the archive to. By default this looks
	   something like:
	       /CPANPLUS_BASE/PERL_VERSION/BUILD/MODULE_NAME

       prefer_bin
	   A flag indicating whether you prefer a pure perl solution, ie
	   "Archive::Tar" or "Archive::Zip" respectively, or a binary solution
	   like "unzip" and "tar".

       perl
	   The path to the perl executable to use for any perl calls. Also
	   used to determine the build version directory for extraction.

       verbose
	   Specifies whether to be verbose or not. Defaults to your
	   corresponding config entry.

       force
	   Specifies whether to force the extraction or not. Defaults to your
	   corresponding config entry.

       All other options are passed on verbatim to "__unzip" or "__untar".

       Returns the directory the file was extracted to on success and false on
       failure.
