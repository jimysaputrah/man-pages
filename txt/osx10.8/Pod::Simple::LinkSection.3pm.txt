NAME
       Pod::Simple::LinkSection -- represent "section" attributes of L codes

SYNOPSIS
	# a long story

DESCRIPTION
       This class is not of interest to general users.

       Pod::Simple uses this class for representing the value of the "section"
       attribute of "L" start-element events.  Most applications can just use
       the normal stringification of objects of this class; they stringify to
       just the text content of the section, such as "foo" for "L<Stuff/foo>",
       and "bar" for "L<Stuff/bI<ar>>".

       However, anyone particularly interested in getting the full value of
       the treelet, can just traverse the content of the treeleet
       @$treelet_object.  To wit:

	 % perl -MData::Dumper -e
	   "use base qw(Pod::Simple::Methody);
	    sub start_L { print Dumper($_[1]{'section'} ) }
	    __PACKAGE__->new->parse_string_document('=head1 L<Foo/bI<ar>baz>>')
	   "
       Output:
	 $VAR1 = bless( [
			  '',
			  {},
			  'b',
			  bless( [
				   'I',
				   {},
				   'ar'
				 ], 'Pod::Simple::LinkSection' ),
			  'baz'
			], 'Pod::Simple::LinkSection' );

       But stringify it and you get just the text content:

	 % perl -MData::Dumper -e
	   "use base qw(Pod::Simple::Methody);
	    sub start_L { print Dumper( '' . $_[1]{'section'} ) }
	    __PACKAGE__->new->parse_string_document('=head1 L<Foo/bI<ar>baz>>')
	   "
       Output:
	 $VAR1 = 'barbaz';
