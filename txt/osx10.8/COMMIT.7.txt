COMMIT(7)		PostgreSQL 9.1.4 Documentation		     COMMIT(7)



NAME
       COMMIT - commit the current transaction

SYNOPSIS
       COMMIT [ WORK | TRANSACTION ]

DESCRIPTION
       COMMIT commits the current transaction. All changes made by the
       transaction become visible to others and are guaranteed to be durable
       if a crash occurs.

PARAMETERS
       WORK, TRANSACTION
	   Optional key words. They have no effect.

NOTES
       Use ROLLBACK(7) to abort a transaction.

       Issuing COMMIT when not inside a transaction does no harm, but it will
       provoke a warning message.

EXAMPLES
       To commit the current transaction and make all changes permanent:

	   COMMIT;

COMPATIBILITY
       The SQL standard only specifies the two forms COMMIT and COMMIT WORK.
       Otherwise, this command is fully conforming.

SEE ALSO
       BEGIN(7), ROLLBACK(7)
