NAME
       sasl_checkpass - Check a plaintext password

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sasl/sasl.h>

       int sasl_checkpass(sasl_conn_t *conn,
			const char *user,
			unsigned userlen,
			const char *pass,
			unsigned passlen);


DESCRIPTION
       sasl_checkpass()  will  check  a plaintext password. This is needed for
       protocols that had a login method before SASL (for  example  the  LOGIN
       command	in  IMAP). The password is checked with the pwcheck_method See
       sasl_callbacks(3) for information on how this parameter is set.


RETURN VALUE
       sasl_checkpass returns an integer which corresponds to one of the  fol-
       lowing  codes.  SASL_OK	indicates that the authentication is complete.
       All other return codes indicate errors and should either be handled  or
       the  authentication  session  should  be  quit.	See sasl_errors(3) for
       meanings of return codes.
