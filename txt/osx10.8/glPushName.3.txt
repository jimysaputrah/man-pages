GLPUSHNAME(3G)							GLPUSHNAME(3G)



NAME
       glPushName, glPopName - push and pop the name stack


C SPECIFICATION
       void glPushName( GLuint name )


PARAMETERS
       name  Specifies a name that will be pushed onto the name stack.

C SPECIFICATION
       void glPopName( void )


DESCRIPTION
       The name stack is used during selection mode to allow sets of rendering
       commands to be uniquely identified.  It consists of an ordered  set  of
       unsigned integers and is initially empty.

       glPushName  causes  name  to  be pushed onto the name stack.  glPopName
       pops one name off the top of the stack.

       The  maximum  name  stack  depth  is   implementation-dependent;   call
       GL_MAX_NAME_STACK_DEPTH	to  find out the value for a particular imple-
       mentation. It is an error to push a name onto a full stack, or to pop a
       name  off  an  empty stack.  It is also an error to manipulate the name
       stack between the execution of glBegin and the corresponding  execution
       of  glEnd.   In	any of these cases, the error flag is set and no other
       change is made to GL state.

       The name stack is always empty while the render mode is not  GL_SELECT.
       Calls to glPushName or glPopName while the render mode is not GL_SELECT
       are ignored.

ERRORS
       GL_STACK_OVERFLOW is generated if glPushName is called while  the  name
       stack is full.

       GL_STACK_UNDERFLOW  is  generated if glPopName is called while the name
       stack is empty.

       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if glPushName or  glPopName  is  exe-
       cuted between a call to glBegin and the corresponding call to glEnd.

ASSOCIATED GETS
       glGet with argument GL_NAME_STACK_DEPTH
       glGet with argument GL_MAX_NAME_STACK_DEPTH
