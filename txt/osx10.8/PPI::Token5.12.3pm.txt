       code.

METHODS
   set_content $string
       The "set_content" method allows to set/change the string that the
       "PPI::Token" object represents.

       Returns the string you set the Token to

   add_content $string
       The "add_content" method allows you to add additional bytes of code to
       the end of the Token.

       Returns the new full string after the bytes have been added.

   length
       The "length" method returns the length of the string in a Token.
