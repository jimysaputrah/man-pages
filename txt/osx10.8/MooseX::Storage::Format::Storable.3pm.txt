NAME
       MooseX::Storage::Format::Storable - A Storable serialization role

SYNOPSIS
	 package Point;
	 use Moose;
	 use MooseX::Storage;

	 with Storage('format' => 'Storable');

	 has 'x' => (is => 'rw', isa => 'Int');
	 has 'y' => (is => 'rw', isa => 'Int');

	 1;

	 my $p = Point->new(x => 10, y => 10);

	 ## methods to freeze/thaw into
	 ## a specified serialization format

	 # pack the class with Storable
	 my $storable_data = $p->freeze();

	 # unpack the storable data into the class
	 my $p2 = Point->thaw($storable_data);

DESCRIPTION
       This module will "thaw" and "freeze" Moose classes using Storable. It
       uses "Storable::nfreeze" by default so that it can be easily used in
       IPC scenarios across machines or just locally.

       One important thing to note is that this module does not mix well with
       the IO modules. The structures that "freeze" and "thaw" deal with are
       Storable's memory representation, and (as far as I know) that is not
       easily just written onto a file. If you want file based serialization
       with Storable, the please look at the MooseX::Storage::IO::StorableFile
       role instead.

METHODS
       freeze
       thaw ($stored)

   Introspection
       meta

BUGS
       All complex software has bugs lurking in it, and this module is no
       exception. If you find a bug please either email me, or add the bug to
       cpan-RT.
