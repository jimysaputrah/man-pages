NAME
       DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::ODBC::Firebird - Driver for using the
       Firebird RDBMS through ODBC

DESCRIPTION
       Most functionality is provided by
       DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::Firebird::Common, see that driver for
       details.

       To build the ODBC driver for Firebird on Linux for unixODBC, see:

       <http://www.firebirdnews.org/?p=1324>

       This driver does not suffer from the nested statement handles across
       commits issue that the DBD::InterBase or the DBD::Firebird based driver
       does. This makes it more suitable for long running processes such as
       under Catalyst.
