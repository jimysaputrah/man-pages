NAME
       CREATE_USER - define a new database role

SYNOPSIS
       CREATE USER name [ [ WITH ] option [ ... ] ]

       where option can be:

	     SUPERUSER | NOSUPERUSER
	   | CREATEDB | NOCREATEDB
	   | CREATEROLE | NOCREATEROLE
	   | CREATEUSER | NOCREATEUSER
	   | INHERIT | NOINHERIT
	   | LOGIN | NOLOGIN
	   | REPLICATION | NOREPLICATION

	   | IN ROLE role_name [, ...]
	   | IN GROUP role_name [, ...]
	   | ROLE role_name [, ...]
	   | ADMIN role_name [, ...]
	   | USER role_name [, ...]
	   | SYSID uid

DESCRIPTION
       CREATE USER is now an alias for CREATE ROLE (CREATE_ROLE(7)). The only
       difference is that when the command is spelled CREATE USER, LOGIN is
       assumed by default, whereas NOLOGIN is assumed when the command is
       spelled CREATE ROLE.

COMPATIBILITY
       The CREATE USER statement is a PostgreSQL extension. The SQL standard
       leaves the definition of users to the implementation.
