NAME
       Moose::Role - The Moose Role

SYNOPSIS
	 package Eq;
	 use Moose::Role; # automatically turns on strict and warnings

	 requires 'equal';

	 sub no_equal {
	     my ($self, $other) = @_;
	     !$self->equal($other);
	 }

	 # ... then in your classes

	 package Currency;
	 use Moose; # automatically turns on strict and warnings

	 with 'Eq';

	 sub equal {
	     my ($self, $other) = @_;
	     $self->as_float == $other->as_float;
	 }

DESCRIPTION
       The concept of roles is documented in Moose::Manual::Roles. This
       document serves as API documentation.

EXPORTED FUNCTIONS
       Moose::Role currently supports all of the functions that Moose exports,
       but differs slightly in how some items are handled (see "CAVEATS" below
       for details).

       Moose::Role also offers two role-specific keyword exports:

       requires (@method_names)
	   Roles can require that certain methods are implemented by any class
	   which "does" the role.

	   Note that attribute accessors also count as methods for the
	   purposes of satisfying the requirements of a role.

       excludes (@role_names)
	   Roles can "exclude" other roles, in effect saying "I can never be
	   combined with these @role_names". This is a feature which should
	   not be used lightly.

   unimport
       Moose::Role offers a way to remove the keywords it exports, through the
       "unimport" method. You simply have to say "no Moose::Role" at the
       bottom of your code for this to work.

   Moose::Role->init_meta(for_class => $role, metaclass => $metaclass)
       The "init_meta" method sets up the metaclass object for the role
       specified by "for_class". It also injects a a "meta" accessor into the
       role so you can get at this object.

       The default metaclass is Moose::Meta::Role. You can specify an
       alternate metaclass with the "metaclass" parameter.

METACLASS
       When you use Moose::Role, you can specify which metaclass to use:

	   use Moose::Role -metaclass => 'My::Meta::Role';

       You can also specify traits which will be applied to your role
       metaclass:

	   use Moose::Role -traits => 'My::Trait';

       This is very similar to the attribute traits feature. When you do this,
       your class's "meta" object will have the specified traits applied to
       it. See "Metaclass and Trait Name Resolution" in Moose for more
       details.

APPLYING ROLES
       In addition to being applied to a class using the 'with' syntax (see
       Moose::Manual::Roles) and using the Moose::Util 'apply_all_roles'
       method, roles may also be applied to an instance of a class using
       Moose::Util 'apply_all_roles' or the role's metaclass:

	  MyApp::Test::SomeRole->meta->apply( $instance );

       Doing this creates a new, mutable, anonymous subclass, applies the role
       to that, and reblesses. In a debugger, for example, you will see class
       names of the form " Class::MOP::Class::__ANON__::SERIAL::6 ", which
       means that doing a 'ref' on your instance may not return what you
       expect. See Moose::Object for 'DOES'.

       Additional params may be added to the new instance by providing
       'rebless_params'.  See Moose::Meta::Role::Application::ToInstance.

CAVEATS
       Role support has only a few caveats:

       o   Roles cannot use the "extends" keyword; it will throw an exception
	   for now.  The same is true of the "augment" and "inner" keywords
	   (not sure those really make sense for roles). All other Moose
	   keywords will be deferred so that they can be applied to the
	   consuming class.

       o   Role composition does its best to not be order-sensitive when it
	   comes to conflict resolution and requirements detection. However,
	   it is order-sensitive when it comes to method modifiers. All
	   before/around/after modifiers are included whenever a role is
	   composed into a class, and then applied in the order in which the
	   roles are used. This also means that there is no conflict for
	   before/around/after modifiers.

	   In most cases, this will be a non-issue; however, it is something
	   to keep in mind when using method modifiers in a role. You should
	   never assume any ordering.

BUGS
       See "BUGS" in Moose for details on reporting bugs.
