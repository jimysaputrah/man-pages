NAME
       DISCARD - discard session state

SYNOPSIS
       DISCARD { ALL | PLANS | TEMPORARY | TEMP }

DESCRIPTION
       DISCARD releases internal resources associated with a database session.
       These resources are normally released at the end of the session.


       DISCARD TEMP drops all temporary tables created in the current session.
       DISCARD PLANS releases all internally cached query plans.  DISCARD ALL
       resets a session to its original state, discarding temporary resources
       and resetting session-local configuration changes.

PARAMETERS
       TEMPORARY or TEMP
	   Drops all temporary tables created in the current session.

       PLANS
	   Releases all cached query plans.

       ALL
	   Releases all temporary resources associated with the current
	   session and resets the session to its initial state. Currently,
	   this has the same effect as executing the following sequence of
	   statements:

	       SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION DEFAULT;
	       RESET ALL;
	       DEALLOCATE ALL;
	       CLOSE ALL;
	       UNLISTEN *;
	       SELECT pg_advisory_unlock_all();
	       DISCARD PLANS;
	       DISCARD TEMP;

NOTES
       DISCARD ALL cannot be executed inside a transaction block.

COMPATIBILITY
       DISCARD is a PostgreSQL extension.
