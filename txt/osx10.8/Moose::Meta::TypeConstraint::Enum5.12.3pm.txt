NAME
       Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint::Enum - Type constraint for enumerated
       values.

VERSION
       version 2.0205

DESCRIPTION
       This class represents type constraints based on an enumerated list of
       acceptable values.

INHERITANCE
       "Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint::Enum" is a subclass of
       Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint.

METHODS
       Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint::Enum->new(%options)
	   This creates a new enum type constraint based on the given
	   %options.

	   It takes the same options as its parent, with several exceptions.
	   First, it requires an additional option, "values". This should be
	   an array reference containing a list of valid string values.
	   Second, it automatically sets the parent to the "Str" type.

	   Finally, it ignores any provided "constraint" option. The
	   constraint is generated automatically based on the provided
	   "values".

       $constraint->values
	   Returns the array reference of acceptable values provided to the
	   constructor.

       $constraint->create_child_type
	   This returns a new Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint object with the type
	   as its parent.

	   Note that it does not return a "Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint::Enum"
	   object!
