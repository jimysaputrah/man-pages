NAME
       ExtUtils::CBuilder::Platform::Windows - Builder class for Windows
       platforms

DESCRIPTION
       This module implements the Windows-specific parts of
       ExtUtils::CBuilder.  Most of the Windows-specific stuff has to do with
       compiling and linking C code.  Currently we support the 3 compilers
       perl itself supports: MSVC, BCC, and GCC.

       This module inherits from "ExtUtils::CBuilder::Base", so any
       functionality not implemented here will be implemented there.  The
       interfaces are defined by the ExtUtils::CBuilder documentation.
