mitem_userptr(3X)					     mitem_userptr(3X)



NAME
       mitem_userptr - associate application data with a menu item

SYNOPSIS
       #include <menu.h>
       int set_item_userptr(ITEM *item, void *userptr);
       void *item_userptr(const ITEM *item);

DESCRIPTION
       Every  menu  item has a field that can be used to hold application-spe-
       cific data (that is, the menu-driver  code  leaves  it  alone).	 These
       functions get and set that field.

RETURN VALUE
       The  function  item_userptr returns a pointer (possibly NULL).  It does
       not set errno.

       The set_item_userptr always returns E_OK (success).

SEE ALSO
       curses(3X), menu(3X).

NOTES
       The  header  file  <menu.h>  automatically  includes  the  header  file
       <curses.h>.

PORTABILITY
       These  routines	emulate the System V menu library.  They were not sup-
       ported on Version 7 or BSD versions.

       The user pointer is a void pointer.  We chose not to leave it as a char
       pointer for SVr4 compatibility.
