NAME
       TAP::Parser::Utils - Internal TAP::Parser utilities

VERSION
       Version 3.17

SYNOPSIS
	 use TAP::Parser::Utils qw( split_shell )
	 my @switches = split_shell( $arg );

DESCRIPTION
       FOR INTERNAL USE ONLY!

   INTERFACE
       "split_shell"

       Shell style argument parsing. Handles backslash escaping, single and
       double quoted strings but not shell substitutions.

       Pass one or more strings containing shell escaped arguments. The return
       value is an array of arguments parsed from the input strings according
       to (approximate) shell parsing rules. It's legal to pass "undef" in
       which case an empty array will be returned. That makes it possible to

	   my @args = split_shell( $ENV{SOME_ENV_VAR} );

       without worrying about whether the environment variable exists.

       This is used to split HARNESS_PERL_ARGS into individual switches.
