NAME
       PKCS12_create - create a PKCS#12 structure

SYNOPSIS
	#include <openssl/pkcs12.h>

	PKCS12 *PKCS12_create(char *pass, char *name, EVP_PKEY *pkey, X509 *cert, STACK_OF(X509) *ca,
				       int nid_key, int nid_cert, int iter, int mac_iter, int keytype);

DESCRIPTION
       PKCS12_create() creates a PKCS#12 structure.

       pass is the passphrase to use. name is the friendlyName to use for the
       supplied certifictate and key. pkey is the private key to include in
       the structure and cert its corresponding certificates. ca, if not NULL
       is an optional set of certificates to also include in the structure.

       nid_key and nid_cert are the encryption algorithms that should be used
       for the key and certificate respectively. iter is the encryption
       algorithm iteration count to use and mac_iter is the MAC iteration
       count to use.  keytype is the type of key.

NOTES
       The parameters nid_key, nid_cert, iter, mac_iter and keytype can all be
       set to zero and sensible defaults will be used.

       These defaults are: 40 bit RC2 encryption for certificates, triple DES
       encryption for private keys, a key iteration count of
       PKCS12_DEFAULT_ITER (currently 2048) and a MAC iteration count of 1.

       The default MAC iteration count is 1 in order to retain compatibility
       with old software which did not interpret MAC iteration counts. If such
       compatibility is not required then mac_iter should be set to
       PKCS12_DEFAULT_ITER.

       keytype adds a flag to the store private key. This is a non standard
       extension that is only currently interpreted by MSIE. If set to zero
       the flag is omitted, if set to KEY_SIG the key can be used for signing
       only, if set to KEY_EX it can be used for signing and encryption. This
       option was useful for old export grade software which could use signing
       only keys of arbitrary size but had restrictions on the permissible
       sizes of keys which could be used for encryption.

NEW FUNCTIONALITY IN OPENSSL 0.9.8
       Some additional functionality was added to PKCS12_create() in OpenSSL
       0.9.8. These extensions are detailed below.

       If a certificate contains an alias or keyid then this will be used for
       the corresponding friendlyName or localKeyID in the PKCS12 structure.

       Either pkey, cert or both can be NULL to indicate that no key or
       certficate is required. In previous versions both had to be present or
       a fatal error is returned.

       nid_key or nid_cert can be set to -1 indicating that no encryption
       should be used.

       mac_iter can be set to -1 and the MAC will then be omitted entirely.
