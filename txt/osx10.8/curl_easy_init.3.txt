curl_easy_init(3)		libcurl Manual		     curl_easy_init(3)



NAME
       curl_easy_init - Start a libcurl easy session

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curl/curl.h>

       CURL *curl_easy_init( );


DESCRIPTION
       This function must be the first function to call, and it returns a CURL
       easy handle that  you  must  use  as  input  to	other  easy-functions.
       curl_easy_init initializes curl and this call MUST have a corresponding
       call to curl_easy_cleanup(3) when the operation is complete.

       If you did not already call curl_global_init(3), curl_easy_init(3) does
       it  automatically.   This  may be lethal in multi-threaded cases, since
       curl_global_init(3) is not thread-safe, and it may result  in  resource
       problems because there is no corresponding cleanup.

       You  are  strongly  advised  to	not allow this automatic behaviour, by
       calling curl_global_init(3) yourself properly.  See the description  in
       libcurl(3) of global environment requirements for details of how to use
       this function.


RETURN VALUE
       If this function returns NULL, something went wrong and you cannot  use
       the other curl functions.
