GLINDEXMASK(3G) 					       GLINDEXMASK(3G)



NAME
       glIndexMask - control the writing of individual bits in the color index
       buffers


C SPECIFICATION
       void glIndexMask( GLuint mask )


PARAMETERS
       mask  Specifies a bit mask to enable and disable the writing  of  indi-
	     vidual  bits  in the color index buffers.	Initially, the mask is
	     all 1's.

DESCRIPTION
       glIndexMask controls the writing of individual bits in the color  index
       buffers.   The  least significant n bits of mask, where n is the number
       of bits in a color index buffer, specify  a  mask.   Where  a  1  (one)
       appears in the mask, it's possible to write to the corresponding bit in
       the color index buffer (or buffers).  Where a  0  (zero)  appears,  the
       corresponding bit is write-protected.

       This  mask  is  used  only in color index mode, and it affects only the
       buffers currently selected for writing (see glDrawBuffer).   Initially,
       all bits are enabled for writing.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_OPERATION  is  generated  if glIndexMask is executed between
       the execution of glBegin and the corresponding execution of glEnd.

ASSOCIATED GETS
       glGet with argument GL_INDEX_WRITEMASK
