NAME
       sasl_client_start - Begin an authentication negotiation

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sasl/sasl.h>

       int sasl_client_start(sasl_conn_t * conn,
		       const char * mechlist,
		       sasl_interact_t ** prompt_need,
		       const char ** clientout,
		       unsigned * clientoutlen,
		       const char ** mech);


DESCRIPTION
       sasl_client_start()  selects  a mechanism for authentication and starts
       the authentication session. The mechlist is the list of mechanisms  the
       client  might like to use. The mechanisms in the list are not necessar-
       ily supported by the client or even valid.  SASL  determines  which  of
       these to use based upon the security preferences specified earlier. The
       list of mechanisms is typically a list of mechanisms  the  server  sup-
       ports acquired from a capability request.

       If SASL_INTERACT is returned the library needs some values to be filled
       in before it can proceed. The prompt_need structure will be  filled  in
       with  requests.	The application should fulfill these requests and call
       sasl_client_start again	with  identical  parameters  (the  prompt_need
       parameter  will	be  the  same  pointer	as before but filled in by the
       application).


       mechlist is a list of mechanisms the server has available.  Punctuation
       if ignored.

       prompt_need  is filled in with a list of prompts needed to continue (if
       necessary).

       clientout and  clientoutlen  is	created.  It  is  the  initial	client
       response  to send to the server. It is the job of the client to send it
       over the network to the server.	Any protocal specific  encoding  (such
       as base64 encoding) necessary needs to be done by the client.

       If  the protocol lacks client-send-first capability, then set clientout
       to NULL.

       If there is no initial client-send, then *clientout will be set to NULL
       on return.

       mech contains the name of the chosen SASL mechanism (on success)


RETURN VALUE
       sasl_client_start  returns  an  integer which corresponds to one of the
       following codes. SASL_CONTINUE indicates sucess and that there are more
       steps  needed  in  the  authentication. All other return codes indicate
       errors and should either  be  handled  or  the  authentication  session
       should be quit.
