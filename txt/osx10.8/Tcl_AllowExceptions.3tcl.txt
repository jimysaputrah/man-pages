NAME

SYNOPSIS
       #include <tcl.h>

					evaluated.
_________________________________________________________________


DESCRIPTION
       If a script is evaluated at top-level (i.e. no other scripts are  pend-
       ing  evaluation	when  the script is invoked), and if the script termi-
       nates  with  a  completion  code  other	than  TCL_OK,	TCL_ERROR   or
       TCL_RETURN,  then  Tcl  normally  converts this into a TCL_ERROR return
       with an appropriate message.  The particular script  evaluation	proce-
       dures  of  Tcl  that act in the manner are Tcl_EvalObjEx, Tcl_EvalObjv,
       Tcl_Eval, Tcl_EvalEx,  Tcl_GlobalEval,  Tcl_GlobalEvalObj,  Tcl_VarEval
       and Tcl_VarEvalVA.

       However,  if  Tcl_AllowExceptions is invoked immediately before calling
       one of those a procedures, then arbitrary completion codes are  permit-
       ted  from the script, and they are returned without modification.  This
       is useful in cases where the caller can deal with  exceptions  such  as
       TCL_BREAK or TCL_CONTINUE in a meaningful way.


KEYWORDS
