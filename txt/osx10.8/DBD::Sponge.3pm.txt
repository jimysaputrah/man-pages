NAME
       DBD::Sponge - Create a DBI statement handle from Perl data

SYNOPSIS
	 my $sponge = DBI->connect("dbi:Sponge:","","",{ RaiseError => 1 });
	 my $sth = $sponge->prepare($statement, {
		 rows => $data,
		 NAME => $names,
		 %attr
	     }
	 );

DESCRIPTION
       DBD::Sponge is useful for making a Perl data structure accessible
       through a standard DBI statement handle. This may be useful to DBD
       module authors who need to transform data in this way.

METHODS
   connect()
	 my $sponge = DBI->connect("dbi:Sponge:","","",{ RaiseError => 1 });

       Here's a sample syntax for creating a database handle for the Sponge
       driver.	No username and password are needed.

   prepare()
	 my $sth = $sponge->prepare($statement, {
		 rows => $data,
		 NAME => $names,
		 %attr
	     }
	 );

       o   The $statement here is an arbitrary statement or name you want to
	   provide as identity of your data. If you're using DBI::Profile it
	   will appear in the profile data.

	   Generally it's expected that you are preparing a statement handle
	   as if a "select" statement happened.

       o   $data is a reference to the data you are providing, given as an
	   array of arrays.

       o   $names is a reference an array of column names for the $data you
	   are providing.  The number and order should match the number and
	   ordering of the $data columns.

       o   %attr is a hash of other standard DBI attributes that you might
	   pass to a prepare statement.

	   Currently only NAME, TYPE, and PRECISION are supported.

BUGS
       Using this module to prepare INSERT-like statements is not currently
       documented.
