GLMATRIXMODE(3G)					      GLMATRIXMODE(3G)



NAME
       glMatrixMode - specify which matrix is the current matrix


C SPECIFICATION
       void glMatrixMode( GLenum mode )


PARAMETERS
       mode  Specifies	which matrix stack is the target for subsequent matrix
	     operations.    Three   values   are    accepted:	 GL_MODELVIEW,
	     GL_PROJECTION,    and   GL_TEXTURE.    The   initial   value   is
	     GL_MODELVIEW.

	     Additionally,  if	the  GL_ARB_imaging  extension	is  supported,
	     GL_COLOR is also accepted.

DESCRIPTION
       glMatrixMode sets the current matrix mode.  mode can assume one of four
       values:

       GL_MODELVIEW		Applies subsequent matrix  operations  to  the
				modelview matrix stack.

       GL_PROJECTION		Applies  subsequent  matrix  operations to the
				projection matrix stack.

       GL_TEXTURE		Applies subsequent matrix  operations  to  the
				texture matrix stack.

       GL_COLOR 		Applies  subsequent  matrix  operations to the
				color matrix stack.

       To find out which matrix stack is currently the target  of  all	matrix
       operations,  call glGet with argument GL_MATRIX_MODE. The initial value
       is GL_MODELVIEW.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if mode is not an accepted value.

       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if glMatrixMode is  executed  between
       the execution of glBegin and the corresponding execution of glEnd.

ASSOCIATED GETS
       glGet with argument GL_MATRIX_MODE
