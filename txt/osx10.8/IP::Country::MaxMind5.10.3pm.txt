NAME
       IP::Country::MaxMind - Look up country by IP Address

SYNOPSIS
	 use IP::Country::MaxMind;

	 my $gi = IP::Country::MaxMind->new(GEOIP_STANDARD);

	 # look up IP address '65.15.30.247'
	 # returns undef if country is unallocated, or not defined in our database
	 my $cc1 = $gi->inet_atocc('65.15.30.247');
	 my $cc2 = $gi->inet_atocc('yahoo.com');

DESCRIPTION
       This module adapts the Geo::IP module to use the same interface as the
       IP::Country modules; thus allowing users to easily switch between using
       the two underlying databases.

DATABASE UPDATES
       Free monthly updates to the database are available from

	 http://www.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/

       If you require greater accuracy, MaxMind offers a Premium database on a
       paid subscription basis.

       The author of this module is in no way associated with MaxMind.

CLASS METHODS
       $gi = IP::Country::MaxMind->new( $flags );
	   Constructs a new IP::Country::MaxMind object with the default
	   database located inside your system's datadir, typically
	   /usr/local/share/GeoIP/GeoIP.dat.

	   Flags can be set to either GEOIP_STANDARD, or for faster
	   performance (at a cost of using more memory), GEOIP_MEMORY_CACHE.
	   When using memory cache you can force a reload if the file is
	   updated by setting GEOIP_CHECK_CACHE.

       $gi = IP::Country::MaxMind->open( $database_filename, $flags );
	   Constructs a new Geo::IP object with the database located at
	   $database_filename.

OBJECT METHODS
       All object methods are designed to be used in an object-oriented
       fashion.

	 $result = $object->foo_method($bar,$baz);

       Using the module in a procedural fashion (without the arrow syntax)
       won't work.

       $cc = $gi->inet_atocc(HOSTNAME)
	   Takes a string giving the name of a host, and translates that to an
	   two-letter country code. Takes arguments of both the 'rtfm.mit.edu'
	   type and '18.181.0.24'. If the host name cannot be resolved,
	   returns undef.  If the resolved IP address is not contained within
	   the database, returns undef.

       $cc = $gi->inet_ntocc(IP_ADDRESS)
	   Takes a string (an opaque string as returned by
	   Socket::inet_aton()) and translates it into a two-letter country
	   code. If the IP address is not contained within the database,
	   returns undef.

       $cc = $gi->db_time()
	   Returns zero. For compatibility only.
