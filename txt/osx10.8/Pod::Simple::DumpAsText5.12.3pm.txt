NAME
       Pod::Simple::DumpAsText -- dump Pod-parsing events as text

SYNOPSIS
	 perl -MPod::Simple::DumpAsText -e \
	  "exit Pod::Simple::DumpAsText->filter(shift)->any_errata_seen" \
	  thingy.pod

DESCRIPTION
       This class is for dumping, as text, the events gotten from parsing a
       Pod document.  This class is of interest to people writing Pod
       formatters based on Pod::Simple. It is useful for seeing exactly what
       events you get out of some Pod that you feed in.

       This is a subclass of Pod::Simple and inherits all its methods.
