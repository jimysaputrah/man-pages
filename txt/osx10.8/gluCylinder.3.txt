NAME
       gluCylinder - draw a cylinder


C SPECIFICATION
       void gluCylinder( GLUquadric* quad,
			 GLdouble base,
			 GLdouble top,
			 GLdouble height,
			 GLint slices,
			 GLint stacks )


PARAMETERS
       quad    Specifies the quadrics object (created with gluNewQuadric).

       base    Specifies the radius of the cylinder at z = 0.

       top     Specifies the radius of the cylinder at z = height.

       height  Specifies the height of the cylinder.

       slices  Specifies the number of subdivisions around the z axis.

       stacks  Specifies the number of subdivisions along the z axis.

DESCRIPTION
       gluCylinder draws a cylinder oriented along the z axis. The base of the
       cylinder is placed at z = 0, and the top at z = height. Like a  sphere,
       a cylinder is subdivided around the z axis into slices, and along the z
       axis into stacks.

       Note that if top is set to 0.0, this routine generates a cone.

       If the orientation is set to GLU_OUTSIDE (with  gluQuadricOrientation),
       then  any generated normals point away from the z axis. Otherwise, they
       point toward the z axis.

       If texturing is turned on (with gluQuadricTexture), then texture  coor-
       dinates	are  generated	so that t ranges linearly from 0.0 at z = 0 to
       1.0 at z = height, and s ranges from 0.0 at the +y axis, to 0.25 at the
       +x axis, to 0.5 at the -y axis, to 0.75 at the -x axis, and back to 1.0
       at the +y axis.
