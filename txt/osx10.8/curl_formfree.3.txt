NAME
       curl_formfree  -  free  a previously build multipart/formdata HTTP POST
       chain

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curl/curl.h>

       void curl_formfree(struct curl_httppost *form);

DESCRIPTION
       curl_formfree() is used to clean up data previously built/appended with
       curl_formadd(3). This must be called when the data has been used, which
       typically means after curl_easy_perform(3) has been called.

       The pointer to free is the same pointer you passed to the CURLOPT_HTTP-
       POST  option,  which  is the firstitem pointer from the curl_formadd(3)
       invoke(s).

       form is the pointer as returned from a previous call to curl_formadd(3)
       and may be NULL.

RETURN VALUE
       None
