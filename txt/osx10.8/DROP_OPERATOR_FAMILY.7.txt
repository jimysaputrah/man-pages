DROP OPERATOR FAMILY(7) PostgreSQL 9.1.4 Documentation DROP OPERATOR FAMILY(7)



NAME
       DROP_OPERATOR_FAMILY - remove an operator family

SYNOPSIS
       DROP OPERATOR FAMILY [ IF EXISTS ] name USING index_method [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ]

DESCRIPTION
       DROP OPERATOR FAMILY drops an existing operator family. To execute this
       command you must be the owner of the operator family.


       DROP OPERATOR FAMILY includes dropping any operator classes contained
       in the family, but it does not drop any of the operators or functions
       referenced by the family. If there are any indexes depending on
       operator classes within the family, you will need to specify CASCADE
       for the drop to complete.

PARAMETERS
       IF EXISTS
	   Do not throw an error if the operator family does not exist. A
	   notice is issued in this case.

       name
	   The name (optionally schema-qualified) of an existing operator
	   family.

       index_method
	   The name of the index access method the operator family is for.

       CASCADE
	   Automatically drop objects that depend on the operator family.

       RESTRICT
	   Refuse to drop the operator family if any objects depend on it.
	   This is the default.

EXAMPLES
       Remove the B-tree operator family float_ops:

	   DROP OPERATOR FAMILY float_ops USING btree;

       This command will not succeed if there are any existing indexes that
       use operator classes within the family. Add CASCADE to drop such
       indexes along with the operator family.

COMPATIBILITY
       There is no DROP OPERATOR FAMILY statement in the SQL standard.
