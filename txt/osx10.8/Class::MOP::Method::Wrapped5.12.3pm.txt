NAME
       Class::MOP::Method::Wrapped - Method Meta Object for methods with
       before/after/around modifiers

VERSION
       version 2.0205

DESCRIPTION
       This is a Class::MOP::Method subclass which implements before, after,
       and around method modifiers.

METHODS
   Construction
       Class::MOP::Method::Wrapped->wrap($metamethod, %options)
	   This is the constructor. It accepts a Class::MOP::Method object and
	   a hash of options.

	   The options are:

	   o	   name

		   The method name (without a package name). This will be
		   taken from the provided Class::MOP::Method object if it is
		   not provided.

	   o	   package_name

		   The package name for the method. This will be taken from
		   the provided Class::MOP::Method object if it is not
		   provided.

	   o	   associated_metaclass

		   An optional Class::MOP::Class object. This is the metaclass
		   for the method's class.

       $metamethod->get_original_method
	   This returns the Class::MOP::Method object that was passed to the
	   constructor.

       $metamethod->add_before_modifier($code)
       $metamethod->add_after_modifier($code)
       $metamethod->add_around_modifier($code)
	   These methods all take a subroutine reference and apply it as a
	   modifier to the original method.

       $metamethod->before_modifiers
       $metamethod->after_modifiers
       $metamethod->around_modifiers
	   These methods all return a list of subroutine references which are
	   acting as the specified type of modifier.
