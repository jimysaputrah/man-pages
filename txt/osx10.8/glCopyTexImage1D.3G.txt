NAME
       glCopyTexImage1D - copy pixels into a 1D texture image

C SPECIFICATION
       void glCopyTexImage1D(GLenum target, GLint level,
			     GLenum internalformat, GLint x, GLint y,
			     GLsizei width, GLint border);

PARAMETERS
       target
	   Specifies the target texture. Must be GL_TEXTURE_1D.

       level
	   Specifies the level-of-detail number. Level 0 is the base image
	   level. Level n is the nth mipmap reduction image.

       internalformat
	   Specifies the internal format of the texture. Must be one of the
	   following symbolic constants: GL_COMPRESSED_RED, GL_COMPRESSED_RG,
	   GL_COMPRESSED_RGB, GL_COMPRESSED_RGBA.  GL_COMPRESSED_SRGB,
	   GL_COMPRESSED_SRGB_ALPHA.  GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT,
	   GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT16, GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT24, GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT32,
	   GL_RED, GL_RG, GL_RGB, GL_R3_G3_B2, GL_RGB4, GL_RGB5, GL_RGB8,
	   GL_RGB10, GL_RGB12, GL_RGB16, GL_RGBA, GL_RGBA2, GL_RGBA4,
	   GL_RGB5_A1, GL_RGBA8, GL_RGB10_A2, GL_RGBA12, GL_RGBA16, GL_SRGB,
	   GL_SRGB8, GL_SRGB_ALPHA, or GL_SRGB8_ALPHA8.

       x, y
	   Specify the window coordinates of the left corner of the row of
	   pixels to be copied.

       width
	   Specifies the width of the texture image. Must be 0 or 2 n + 2 ai
	   border for some integer n. The height of the texture image is 1.

       border
	   Specifies the width of the border. Must be either 0 or 1.

DESCRIPTION
       glCopyTexImage1D defines a one-dimensional texture image with pixels
       from the current GL_READ_BUFFER.

       The screen-aligned pixel row with left corner at x y and with a length
       of width + 2 ai border defines the texture array at the mipmap level
       specified by level.  internalformat specifies the internal format of
       the texture array.

       The pixels in the row are processed exactly as if glReadPixels() had
       been called, but the process stops just before final conversion. At
       this point all pixel component values are clamped to the range 0 1 and
       then converted to the texture's internal format for storage in the
       texel array.

       Pixel ordering is such that lower x screen coordinates correspond to
       lower texture coordinates.

       If any of the pixels within the specified row of the current
       GL_READ_BUFFER are outside the window associated with the current
       rendering context, then the values obtained for those pixels are
       undefined.


       glCopyTexImage1D defines a one-dimensional texture image with pixels
       from the current GL_READ_BUFFER.

       When internalformat is one of the sRGB types, the GL does not
       automatically convert the source pixels to the sRGB color space. In
       this case, the glPixelMap function can be used to accomplish the
       conversion.

NOTES
       1, 2, 3, and 4 are not accepted values for internalformat.

       An image with 0 width indicates a NULL texture.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if target is not one of the allowable
       values.


       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if level is less than 0.


       GL_INVALID_VALUE may be generated if level is greater than log 2 ac
       max, where max is the returned value of GL_MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE.


       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if internalformat is not an allowable
       value.


       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if width is less than 0 or greater than
       GL_MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE.


       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if non-power-of-two textures are not
       supported and the width cannot be represented as 2 n + 2 ai border for
       some integer value of n.


       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if border is not 0 or 1.


       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if internalformat is
       GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT, GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT16, GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT24, or
       GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT32 and there is no depth buffer.
