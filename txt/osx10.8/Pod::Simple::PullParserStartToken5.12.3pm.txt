NAME
       Pod::Simple::PullParserStartToken -- start-tokens from
       Pod::Simple::PullParser

SYNOPSIS
       (See Pod::Simple::PullParser)

DESCRIPTION
       When you do $parser->get_token on a Pod::Simple::PullParser object, you
       might get an object of this class.

       This is a subclass of Pod::Simple::PullParserToken and inherits all its
       methods, and adds these methods:

       $token->tagname
	   This returns the tagname for this start-token object.  For example,
	   parsing a "=head1 ..." line will give you a start-token with the
	   tagname of "head1", token(s) for its content, and then an end-token
	   with the tagname of "head1".

       $token->tagname(somestring)
	   This changes the tagname for this start-token object.  You probably
	   won't need to do this.

       $token->tag(...)
	   A shortcut for $token->tagname(...)

       $token->is_tag(somestring) or $token->is_tagname(somestring)
	   These are shortcuts for "$token->tag() eq somestring"

       $token->attr(attrname)
	   This returns the value of the attrname attribute for this start-
	   token object, or undef.

	   For example, parsing a L<Foo/"Bar"> link will produce a start-token
	   with a "to" attribute with the value "Foo", a "type" attribute with
	   the value "pod", and a "section" attribute with the value "Bar".

       $token->attr(attrname, newvalue)
	   This sets the attrname attribute for this start-token object to
	   newvalue.  You probably won't need to do this.

       $token->attr_hash
	   This returns the hashref that is the attribute set for this start-
	   token.  This is useful if (for example) you want to ask what all
	   the attributes are -- you can just do "keys %{$token->attr_hash}"

       You're unlikely to ever need to construct an object of this class for
       yourself, but if you want to, call
       "Pod::Simple::PullParserStartToken->new( tagname, attrhash )"
