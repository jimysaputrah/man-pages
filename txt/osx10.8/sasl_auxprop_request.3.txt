NAME
       sasl_auxprop_request - Request Auxilliary Properties from SASL


SYNOPSIS
       #include <sasl/sasl.h>


       int sasl_auxprop_request(sasl_conn_t *conn,
			       const char ** propnames)


DESCRIPTION
       sasl_auxprop_request  will request that the SASL library obtain proper-
       ties from any auxilliary property plugins that might be installed (such
       as  the	user's	home directory from an LDAP server for example).  Such
       lookup  occurs  just  after  username  cannonicalization  is  complete.
       Therefore,   the   request   should   be   made	 before  the  call  to
       sasl_server_start(3), but after the call to sasl_server_new(3).

       conn the sasl_conn_t for which the request is being made.

       propnames a NULL-terminated array of property names to  request.   Note
       that  this  array  must	persist  until	a  call to sasl_dispose on the
       sasl_conn_t.


RETURN VALUE
       Returns SASL_OK on success.  See sasl_errors(3) for meanings  of  other
       return codes.


CONFORMING TO
       RFC 2222
