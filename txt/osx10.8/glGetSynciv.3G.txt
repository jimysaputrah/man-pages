NAME
       glGetSynciv - query the properties of a sync object

C SPECIFICATION
       void glGetSynciv(GLsync sync, GLenum pname, GLsizei bufSize,
			GLsizei *length, GLint *values);

PARAMETERS
       sync
	   Specifies the sync object whose properties to query.

       pname
	   Specifies the parameter whose value to retrieve from the sync
	   object specified in sync.

       bufSize
	   Specifies the size of the buffer whose address is given in values.

       length
	   Specifies the address of an variable to receive the number of
	   integers placed in values.

       values
	   Specifies the address of an array to receive the values of the
	   queried parameter.

DESCRIPTION
       glGetSynciv retrieves properties of a sync object.  sync specifies the
       name of the sync object whose properties to retrieve.

       On success, glGetSynciv replaces up to bufSize integers in values with
       the corresponding property values of the object being queried. The
       actual number of integers replaced is returned in the variable whose
       address is specified in length. If length is NULL, no length is
       returned.

       If pname is GL_OBJECT_TYPE, a single value representing the specific
       type of the sync object is placed in values. The only type supported is
       GL_SYNC_FENCE.

       If pname is GL_SYNC_STATUS, a single value representing the status of
       the sync object (GL_SIGNALED or GL_UNSIGNALED) is placed in values.

       If pname is GL_SYNC_CONDITION, a single value representing the
       condition of the sync object is placed in values. The only condition
       supported is GL_SYNC_GPU_COMMANDS_COMPLETE.

       If pname is GL_SYNC_FLAGS, a single value representing the flags with
       which the sync object was created is placed in values. No flags are
       currently supported[1].

       If an error occurs, nothing will be written to values or length.

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if sync is not the name of a sync object.


       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if pname is not one of the accepted
       tokens.
