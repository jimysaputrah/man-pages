DESCRIPTION
       Texturing maps a portion of a specified texture image onto each
       graphical primitive for which texturing is enabled. To enable and
       disable one-dimensional texturing, call glEnable() and glDisable() with
       argument GL_TEXTURE_1D.

       Texture images are defined with glTexImage1D. The arguments describe
       the parameters of the texture image, such as width, width of the
       border, level-of-detail number (see glTexParameter()), and the internal
       resolution and format used to store the image. The last three arguments
       describe how the image is represented in memory.

       If target is GL_PROXY_TEXTURE_1D, no data is read from data, but all of
       the texture image state is recalculated, checked for consistency, and
       checked against the implementation's capabilities. If the
       implementation cannot handle a texture of the requested texture size,
       it sets all of the image state to 0, but does not generate an error
       (see glGetError()). To query for an entire mipmap array, use an image
       array level greater than or equal to 1.

       If target is GL_TEXTURE_1D, data is read from data as a sequence of
       signed or unsigned bytes, shorts, or longs, or single-precision
       floating-point values, depending on type. These values are grouped into
       sets of one, two, three, or four values, depending on format, to form
       elements. Each data byte is treated as eight 1-bit elements, with bit
       ordering determined by GL_UNPACK_LSB_FIRST (see glPixelStore()).

       If a non-zero named buffer object is bound to the
       GL_PIXEL_UNPACK_BUFFER target (see glBindBuffer()) while a texture
       image is specified, data is treated as a byte offset into the buffer
       object's data store.

       The first element corresponds to the left end of the texture array.
       Subsequent elements progress left-to-right through the remaining texels
       in the texture array. The final element corresponds to the right end of
       the texture array.


       format determines the composition of each element in data. It can
       assume one of these symbolic values:

       GL_RED
	   Each element is a single red component. The GL converts it to
	   floating point and assembles it into an RGBA element by attaching 0
	   for green and blue, and 1 for alpha. Each component is then
	   multiplied by the signed scale factor GL_c_SCALE, added to the
	   signed bias GL_c_BIAS, and clamped to the range [0,1].

       GL_RG
	   Each element is a single red/green double The GL converts it to
	   floating point and assembles it into an RGBA element by attaching 0
	   for blue, and 1 for alpha. Each component is then multiplied by the
	   signed scale factor GL_c_SCALE, added to the signed bias GL_c_BIAS,
	   and clamped to the range [0,1].

       GL_RGB

       GL_BGR
	   Each element is an RGB triple. The GL converts it to floating point
	   and assembles it into an RGBA element by attaching 1 for alpha.
	   Each component is then multiplied by the signed scale factor
	   GL_c_SCALE, added to the signed bias GL_c_BIAS, and clamped to the
	   range [0,1].

       GL_RGBA

       GL_BGRA
	   Each element contains all four components. Each component is
	   multiplied by the signed scale factor GL_c_SCALE, added to the
	   signed bias GL_c_BIAS, and clamped to the range [0,1].

       GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT
	   Each element is a single depth value. The GL converts it to
	   floating point, multiplies by the signed scale factor
	   GL_DEPTH_SCALE, adds the signed bias GL_DEPTH_BIAS, and clamps to
	   the range [0,1].

       If an application wants to store the texture at a certain resolution or
       in a certain format, it can request the resolution and format with
       internalFormat. The GL will choose an internal representation that
       closely approximates that requested by internalFormat, but it may not
       match exactly. (The representations specified by GL_RED, GL_RG, GL_RGB
       and GL_RGBA must match exactly.)

       If the internalFormat parameter is one of the generic compressed
       formats, GL_COMPRESSED_RED, GL_COMPRESSED_RG, GL_COMPRESSED_RGB, or
       GL_COMPRESSED_RGBA, the GL will replace the internal format with the
       symbolic constant for a specific internal format and compress the
       texture before storage. If no corresponding internal format is
       available, or the GL can not compress that image for any reason, the
       internal format is instead replaced with a corresponding base internal
       format.

       If the internalFormat parameter is GL_SRGB, GL_SRGB8, GL_SRGB_ALPHAor
       GL_SRGB8_ALPHA8, the texture is treated as if the red, green, or blue
       components are encoded in the sRGB color space. Any alpha component is
       left unchanged. The conversion from the sRGB encoded component c s to a
       linear component c l is:


       c l = { c s 12.92 if c s ax 0.04045 ( c s + 0.055 1.055 ) 2.4 if c s >
       0.04045

       Assume c s is the sRGB component in the range [0,1].

       Use the GL_PROXY_TEXTURE_1D target to try out a resolution and format.
       The implementation will update and recompute its best match for the
       requested storage resolution and format. To then query this state, call
       glGetTexLevelParameter(). If the texture cannot be accommodated,
       texture state is set to 0.

       A one-component texture image uses only the red component of the RGBA
       color from data. A two-component image uses the R and A values. A
       three-component image uses the R, G, and B values. A four-component
       image uses all of the RGBA components.

       Image-based shadowing can be enabled by comparing texture r coordinates
       to depth texture values to generate a boolean result. See
       glTexParameter() for details on texture comparison.

NOTES
       glPixelStore() modes affect texture images.


       data may be a null pointer. In this case texture memory is allocated to
       accommodate a texture of width width. You can then download subtextures
       to initialize the texture memory. The image is undefined if the program
       tries to apply an uninitialized portion of the texture image to a
       primitive.


       glTexImage1D specifies the one-dimensional texture for the current
       texture unit, specified with glActiveTexture().

ERRORS
       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if target is not GL_TEXTURE_1D or
       GL_PROXY_TEXTURE_1D.


       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if format is not an accepted format
       constant. Format constants other than GL_STENCIL_INDEX are accepted.


       GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if type is not a type constant.


       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if level is less than 0.


       GL_INVALID_VALUE may be generated if level is greater than log 2 ai
       max, where max is the returned value of GL_MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE.


       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if internalFormat is not one of the
       accepted resolution and format symbolic constants.


       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if width is less than 0 or greater than
       GL_MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE.


       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if non-power-of-two textures are not
       supported and the width cannot be represented as 2 n + 2 ai border for
       some integer value of n.


       GL_INVALID_VALUE is generated if border is not 0 or 1.


       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if type is one of
       GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE_3_3_2, GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE_2_3_3_REV,
       GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT_5_6_5, or GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT_5_6_5_REV and format is
       not GL_RGB.


       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if type is one of
       GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT_4_4_4_4, GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT_4_4_4_4_REV,
       GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT_5_5_5_1, GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT_1_5_5_5_REV,

       GL_UNSIGNED_INT_10_10_10_2, or GL_UNSIGNED_INT_2_10_10_10_REV and
       format is neither GL_RGBA nor GL_BGRA.


       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if format is GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT and
       internalFormat is not GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT, GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT16,
       GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT24, or GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT32.


       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if internalFormat is
       GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT, GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT16, GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT24, or
       GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT32, and format is not GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT.


       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if a non-zero buffer object name is
       bound to the GL_PIXEL_UNPACK_BUFFER target and the buffer object's data
       store is currently mapped.


       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if a non-zero buffer object name is
       bound to the GL_PIXEL_UNPACK_BUFFER target and the data would be
       unpacked from the buffer object such that the memory reads required
       would exceed the data store size.


       GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if a non-zero buffer object name is
       bound to the GL_PIXEL_UNPACK_BUFFER target and data is not evenly
       divisible into the number of bytes needed to store in memory a datum
       indicated by type.
